<Content>Great Location Picked this hotel based on reviews on tripadvisor and perceived value for money: were were not disapointed on either front. A suite for 2 nights was 鈧?02 which was great value in comparison to other hotels of this stan dard and location. Our room was spacious, had a microwave and complimentary mini bar. This was a lovely surprise as was the vouchers for complimentary lunch or dinner with a glass of wine each day. We also got a plate of fruit left in the room as a welcome. This is part of the superior room deal. It is located adjacent to the main shopping drag and is a modern well equipped building. There are a variety of retaurants nearby to choose from, indian, chinese, thai, kebab, mcdonalds etc.. The bar and restaurant is very comfortable and inviting and we really enjoyed our tapas lunch, tasty indeed.If coming back to frankfurt this is a hotel I would definitely stay in. Staff were friendly and efficient also.

<Content>No more- no less We stayed here for 1 nights in Sep while in transit. Due to flight times we spent to full days in Frankfurt. Although Frankfurt is a major business hub and is home to one of the busisest retails strips in Europe, it should be avoided if possible. The accomodation at teh the hotel was perfect - no t over priced and the service of a good standard. Staff were polite and helpfull at all times. In this regard we always try and use NH Hotels when tyravelling if we come accross them in the cities we wnat to visit. Generally they are well located and always of a good standard.There is not much to do in Franfurt. One can visit the old city, the weekly market for great fresh rolls and smoked trout and do a bit of shopping. But if your looking for a vibe...look elsewher.

<Content>Good for a business trip Good, comfortable hotel in a central location. For the price, the choice at breakfast was fantastic. It was far far better than the better quality and more expensive hotel I recently stayed at in London. Room was clean and tidy and reasonably spacious, if a little too warm. The room's ventilation/air conditioning didn't seem to deal with the situation very well. But this was my only gripe.

<Content>very nice hotel with modern rooms I must say that I was positively surprised by the quality of this NH Hotel. I had some negative experiences with other hotels of this chain but this one is really good.The location is just perfect, the staff very friendly, the rooms very modern and you do not hear the noise from outside. They have a great bar and a good restaurant. Only handicap: no parking available. You have to park your car in a parking garage near by.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel in Frankfurt Had a stop over in Frankfurt on our way home to Canada and stayed at the Nh Frankfurt City hotel. The hotel was very very clean, and beautifully appointed. Check in was a breeze and the staff spoke very good english as my german is not very good. The elevator access required a room key which was a nice security feature. Beds were very comfortable as were the duvets. You also get a lot of free stuff like a razor, toothbrush, comb, shampoo, conditioner, etc... Which was great for us as our bags were held at the airport and we didn't carry this stuff in our carry ons! One bad thing that I can think of is the shower tub is very high and not very good for anyone with a problem lifting their legs up. The hotel is located about 200 metres from the Zeil (pronouced Zile) pedestrian boulevard. Tons of shops, cafes and restaraunts can be found there. Even at night it was a safe place to be. Taxi ride to and from the airport was only 30 Euro each way but there were street cars running right outside and you could easily get around using public transport. Would definately stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Nice Hotel, but Terrible Restaurant I have stayed at this hotel for 3 years now. They have a good frequent guest program where they return normally about 10% of the value of your stay...not bad. This particular branch has better rooms than some. Comfortable but not luxurious. But every year I have always tried to have one meal at the restaurant (other than breakfast...which is self service and VERY good). The problem is that they are understaffed apparently, even for a small number of guests. The service is incredibly slow, wait staff is surly if you complain, and the food is below average in quality, and expensive on top of that. I recommend the hotel to stay in, but dine elsewhere.

<Content>Cleanest bathroom I've ever seen! The bathroom was impressively and perfectly WHITE and CLEAN! Loved the hotel, great stay- great location near the subway station and near the main shopping area. Walking distance to the city center. There is no wireless internet in the room, but they do provide FREE wired LAN service. Bring your LAN cable for your laptop! The only criticism that I have is the prices. I purposely booked my room on the internet with no breakfast as breakfast is 22 Euros per person per day! Yikes! And they charged me for breakfast (I didn鈥檛 even enter the restaurant) anyway. The front desk person when I checked out was nice enough to ask and take it off for me. Beware of EXTRA charges on your bill. I was charged 20 Euros for calls I didn鈥檛 make!.

<Content>Good value in Frankfurt My mother and I stayed at the NH Frankfurt City for two nights in July 2007 as part of her 50th birthday trip to Europe.We liked the location- it was very near an U-bahn station, close to shopping and restaurants, and an easy location for our friends living in Frankfurt to pick us up at.Rooms were clean, well-maintained, and modern, with good bathroom amenities, although not as large as some of the other NH properties I have stayed in. Front desk staff were helpful, tolerant of my schoolgirl German, and excellent English speakers for my mother.Frankfurt hotels on the whole can be pretty utilitarian, but we found our stay here to be very comfortable- definitely worth the 4-star rating.

<Content>Great Value City hotel Stayed for 1 night in September on a business trip. The hotel is around 5 minutes walk from the S bahn at Konstablerwache and was fairly easy to find. Check in was OK, the room was a good size, but what impressed me for the 99 euros paid was the free wireless internet in the lobby and bar (no problem operated straight away). There are also 2 PCs downstairs near reception. Add in the excellent shower and toiletries and the great Indian restaurant across the road and this hotel is very good value for money. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel as it can be expensive, but there are several well priced bakeries nearby as an alternative. Would definetely recommend.

<Content>Good value for the room, expensive breakfast Stayed here for one night and very much enjoyed the hotel, its rooms and its location.In a city not known for low hotel prices, the nh-hotel is a nice exception. The design of the public areas as well as of the rooms are mordern: white walls, dark woods, colourfull glass elements. Although the lobby looks a little more promising than the rooms eventually are, but the rooms are still very good and nicely decored and their size is ok for a downtown hotel.Most important to me is always cleanliness of guest rooms and bath rooms. And this hotel really delivers: not a single peace of dust etc. could be found.Location is very nice: only few minutes from Frankfurt downtown shopping area Zeil and S-Bahn station Konstablerwache this hotel is really close to all downtown hotels.Only one thing bothered me: EUR 22 p.p. for a breakfeast is somehow pricy.

<Content>OK but just for a good rate The NH Hotel is OK if you get a very good rate.We have stayed in a standard room and they are pretty small. You should like your partner very much because of the small double bed which is app. 1,5 meter.Yes, they have aircon but the performance is so low, that you do not get it colder in the room.The location is the real interesting thing with this hotel it is directly behind the shopping district of Frankfurt.

<Content>Great hotel, excellent location I booked this hotel based on other reviews and I wasn't disappointed. The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful during the check-in process and my room was the perfect size and very clean. The breakfast at the hotel was above par for buffet style - cheese and meat selection, baked beans, eggs, all kinds of yogurt and muesli, and they even had the traditional Japanese and Turkish breakfast out. I stuff myself silly it was so good. The hotel is a short walk from the main pedestrian street and many restaurants and sites. The concierge was also helpful in pointed out places on a map and made recommendations. Next to the hotel are an Indian and Thai restaurant and a gelato shop, and the hotel bar was also excellent and the staff was friendly and chatty. I would stay here again.

<Content>NH Frankfurt I stayed in this hotel for the Paperworld Messe , I paid $500.00 per Night for Two Nights , When we got there they told me that I booked a Regular Room and If I wanted to upgreade for 25 Euro ($32.50 ) to A superior room which has a robe and a Coffe Maker , I declined Next problem was the system for the room keys were down so that meant that i couldnt check in , I left My bags at the hotel and came back after work got my room keys and went up to my room on the 5th floor , The room was not cleaned since the other person checked out so i went back downstairs to complain the recposonist was helpful but it looked like i was bothering her went to my room and found out that all rooms come with coffe maker and robe so no need to spend the extra money just a plain gimmick , overall the rooms are big for a european hotel size location is great but the staff is very unpleasnt , and not helpfull for anything , they are on their cellphones quite allot and you need to wait til they stop laughing ,

<Content>Great Hotel!! Hotel was excellently located near city centre and direct transfer by S-bahn to the airport. Reception staff were excelllent and nothing was too much for them!! Rooms were clean and very spacious! Only slight drawback was the limited space in the breakfast area, as when the hotel is busy, you have to wait for a table. Also the neighbours of the hotel are a peep show, and a Trinkhalle! However we never had any problems, 2 women coming back late at night. And it is Frankfurt, peep shows etc are in busy areas, Germany being more liberal than some countires!Would recommend to any couples, friends or families with older children, as they have no cots or high chairs for young children.Would definately stay there again!

<Content>A Fantastic Hotel This hotel is great! Can't beat the location, just off of the main pedestrian shopping street and 1 block from the S and U bahn local transport. You can take the S8 or S9 directly from the airport to the Konstablerwache stop which is 1 block from the hotel for about $4. Also, walking distance to the Romer platz. By booking through the Frankfurt City Tourist Office we were able to get a great package price which included the large buffet breakfast every morning. The hotel offers non-smoking floors and a non-smoking section in the breakfast room. The standard double rooms are of good size and the hotel has sound proof windows keeping out the street noise and making the rooms very quiet. The curtains are nice and dark as well for good sleeping. The bathroom was a decent size and even the standard room came with bathrobes for guest use. Overall, our 6 night stay could not have been nicer. Having traveled to Europe 14 times now, I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Recommended for your trip to Frankfurt We stayed here for 2 nights (25-27 September 2006) and found the hotel to be good value. We paid 318 EUROS for the 2 nights.We did have a small problem when we arrived, but the front desk quickly fixed it for us. We had ordered a double bed room and the room they have us had 2 singles. But as I said, they changed rooms for us straight away.The rooms were a good size and modern. The restuarant had a good selection of food and was good value. The buffet breakfast was not included in the room rate, but we did try it one morning and it had a large selection of food and drinks. The hotel is in a good location.Overall we enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Choice for a Short Duration Stay We spent 2 nights (Oct 20-21) in Frankfurt....We checked this hotel on Trip Advisor before confirming the reservation with our travel agent and could not find any unsatisfied reviews...Thanks to our travel agent suggestion we had the best location ever :)....It's a short stroll to Old Town and all main attractions (Cathedral, Customs Building, Iron Bridge etc)....Also it's a 3-minute walk to Zeil, the main shopping street in Frankfurt, with a number of great restaurants to dine....We had no breakfast included as we rarely have a meal before 11am, however, there was a coffee maker in a room which was a big plus to have a cup of coffee in the morning and a cup of relaxing tea at night....Our room was very clean, with modern furnishing, facing small city street....We are planning another trip to Europe next year and would be staying at this hotel again, no doubt....

<Content>Solid business option I stayed at the NH Frankfurt City for 2 days during the Frankfurt Book Fair 2006. I thought it was a very pleasant business hotel, if lacking in atmosphere and soul. Desk staff were helpful, room clean and a good size, location reasonable although not perfect for Bookfair as the hotel is 4.5KM from the fair grounds. Very central for the main shops. Breakfast was a big, decent spread but nothing exciting.A good tip for eating out at a funky bar/restaurant away from tourists - walk 10 mins north and slightly west of the hotel into the Bornheim area. Hotel staff will give you a map. I ate at Harveys - it was very nice - don't let the website give you the impression that it's over-the-top, very good dishes and friendly staff [-]

<Content>Good choice We stayed in this hotel when we travelled to Frankfurt to watch the World Cup.The hotel is in a good, central location. It is close to the main shopping district and about 10-15 minutes walk away from the main square and the main restaurants area. There are plenty of nice little restaurants right next to the hotel though.This is very much a business hotel with a clean, sophisticated reception area, very professional staff and good sized modern rooms and bathrooms. We booked well in advance on the hotel's website and were able to get the room for a very cheap rate - especially considering this is a four star hotel and the City was hosting the World Cup!

<Content>Not horrible, but many problems Some background. I stayed two separate nights in September as I used Frankfurt for a base of operations. I left my luggage at the hotel when I had to connect back through Frankfurt.The first problem with this hotel is the name. When you arrive at the Hauptbanhof (Central Train Station) and ask a cabbie to take you to the NH City Hotel, he will respond there are three. If you haven't printed out your itenerary, then this will cause some confusion. (this happened both times I was there)When I arrived at the hotel, I thought the service was perfunctory. The receptionist shoved the registration card in my face even though I had filled it out before. When I asked if I had to fill it out again, she nearly bit my head off when I didn't instantly sign it. Sorry I don't know all the regulations!The second time I was there, they didn't put my stored luggage in my room when I arrived and didn't offer to help bring it to the room. I had to ask.The corridor rugs are filthy and it looks like a frat-house with beer stains (or worse). The rooms, however, are clean, quiet and nicely designed.The restauarant was wanting. I arrived late on a Sunday night and they all but ignored me. I had to go to the bar to order and then the food took forever to arrive even though there were more waiters than diners. They seemed more interested in closing down for the night than serving their customers. The pizza I ordered tasted like they went out and ordered it from Dominos. Though at least Dominos would arrive hot.The hotel was not a fortune, just over 100 Euros, but I had expected more from the NH. I would definitely choose something else whether I stay in Frankfurt or in another location with NH.

<Content>NIce hotel, excellent location I booked two rooms for my family. The rooms were nice and clean, not small, but not huge by American standards. I had asked that they be next to each other, but they weren't. Not a big deal, but also not what I asked for several months in advance.The bathrooms were immaculate. The hotel itself was very, very quiet - great for us jet-lagged folks. They let us check in at 9:30 a.m., which was a real godsend. Also, its location near the Zeil shopping area and Fressgasse and Sachsenhausen restaurant areas made things much simpler for our one-night stay.The staff was courteous and helpful and spoke English to varying degrees. They indulged my rusty German, too.It's a 33 Euro cab ride to and from the airport for a family of four with four suitcases. There's a subway stop not far from the hotel, but we didn't feel like figuring out the system and hauling our luggage around.Oh, and be sure to bring a travel clock. We would stay there again.

The rooms were good, clean and all very new. The front desk staff were nice enough, though their english could use some work. I highly recommend the breakfast in the morning..it was amazing, tons of food, very good food at that!!! The location is pretty good. A nice walk to the river, not too bad and just a block away from the large shopping district.

<Content>Disappointed My husband, daughter and I have just spent 11 days in Germany during the Soccer World Cup. Wow - what a country!!! Great hospitality and people very helpful and friendly. We made three hotel bookings according to ratings and comments from this website and this was the only disappointment. We were promised a large room so that we could have an extra bed for my daughter but what we got was certainly not a large room. Also, the coffee/tea maker as promised in the booking price never materialised. There was also very little cupboard space and no tourist brochures or information available at reception. On the plus side - rooms nice and dark and also very quiet and as we were leaving in the evening we requested a day room and were allowed to stay in our room until 17h30 at no extra cost, which we apprecaited. Good location for shopping, transport and eating.

<Content>Convenient Hotel We spent two nights here at the beginning of our European vacation. The hotel is a reasonable cab ride from both the main train station and the airport, and a couple of blocks from the underground. The rooms are very clean, quiet and well appointed. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are dark for sleeping. The rooms may not be fancy, but they are very well designed - all space is efficiently used. We did not eat in the hotel, but found a good bakery for breakfast. We enjoyed a very good German dinner at the Twelve Apostle and an outstanding Thai meal at Rama Thai, both on the next block. The staff was friendly and very helpful.
