<Content>Perfect location! We spent 3 nights at the Hotel Moderno and we simply loved it. All major sites are within walking distance and we enjoyed stralling in the busy streets of Old Madrid. There are excellent breakfast options in the neighborhood, where we coud mingle with the locals and savour great Spanish pastries and churros! The Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was somehow small, but we did not expect anything bigger from a city hotel.We have already recommended the hotel to other members of the family and we would definitely return if ever back in Madrid.

<Content>Small, noisy, cold, unfriendly hotel The room we were first given was tiny with no view. The window opened on to what I can only describe as a large lift shaft which smelt of cooking fat. We were moved to an equally cramped room, but nevertheless one with a marginally better outlook than the first (it looked on to a side street).As it was winter, the air conditioning was switched off, so in order to have fresh air in the room, we had no option but to open the window and put up with the noise from the street (sirens, shouting, fireworks, garbage collection, etc). Much of this went on all night.The staff were indifferent, and one in particular was somewhat miserable and quite rude whenever dealing with us - particularly when we asked if we could change rooms.One afternoon I realised the heating wasn't working, so I phoned down to tell them only to get the response are you cold?. I might have thought of a witty reply, but I was too cold and tired. Apparently the heating only goes on at certain times of the day!The free WIFI was unreliable to say the least - the connection often cutting out for no apparent reason. And on our last morning, we had no access at all, even though we should have done until noon. I thought it was more trouble than it was worth to enquire as to why this was - given the responses I'd previously had to my queries.The room wasn't cleaned properly - different kinds of hair (not ours) appearing every day on the bathroom floor.Needless to stay, I will never stay there again.

<Content>Great location Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during our stay in Madrid. Wanted to stay in a moderate-priced 3 star hotel right near Puerto del sol and this exactly fit the bill. The hotel is located right in front of Sol Station (1 of the most convenient train stations when in Madrid) which is close to all the tourist attractions.Staff was very nice and friendly and the rooms were spacious and very quiet, considering the location. To get to the airport, you can either book a shuttle (through the hotel, 21euro for up to 3 people) or you can take a taxi (there is a taxi pickup location right in front of the hotel) . We took a taxi and it was total 28euro, even during morning rush hour!

<Content>Splendidly located and friendly hotel I privately organised a visit to Madrid for the members and wives of the Rotary Club of Guisborough and Great Ayton, UK. I received a most friendly and helpful welcome from Santiago and his staff. The hotel lies at the centre of this great city with perfect connections and close to a city tour bus stop, for example. There are many restaurants, bars and a chocolateria (a must!) all close at hand. The rooms were perfectly clean, comfortable, well appointed and efficiently soundproofed for this lively hub of city life. The art galleries, museums and Royal Palace are all within easy walking reach. Nothing was too much trouble and advice, bookings and ideas were put forward to make our stay very entertaining and enjoyable. Suited us perfectly. Philip Wallwork, President.

<Content>Good value for money After much trawling the web looking at various hotels and not knowing Madrid at all, I was really pleased with having chosen this hotel. It is very central and withing walking distance of loads of places you are likely to want to visit. It is situated right beside the Sol metro station but on a pedestrian street. The double glazing on the windows is excellent and our room was incredibly quiet in terms of outside street noise. We did however hear the people in the next room laughing and talking but they were being quite loud and it was only a one-off so it didn't bother us. The staff were helpful and the reception was open 24 hours so you could come and go when you liked. We didn't have breakfast there but just got something at various local cafes. The hotel is in a really good location in terms of tapas bars and restaurants with a good selection just a 5 or 10 minute walk away and if you feel like bit of clubbing, the Madrid Club, Joy, is just a shimmy away in the same street. The famous Labra bar where the Spanish Socialist movement was started, is directly behind the hotel and well worth a visit. The room itself was just what you need - not overly luxurious but not totally functional either. Nicely decorated with fresh towels and beds made up each day. Hairdryer in room, along with bath and shower products. No mini bar or tea/coffee making equipment in our room however. Highlight for me has got to be the hydromassage whirlpool bath. Mmm, bliss after a hard day's pounding the Madrid streets.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel and Great Location! The staff is really nice and will try to accomodate you any way they can. The rooms are clean, spacious, and nicely appointed. Free wifi! ...And the lounges with wifi are very nice and comfortable. Although there麓s a sign in the bathroom saying if you forget something they can accomodate you, they did not have a toothbrush. The front desk staff were friendly and accomodating and gave us good advice. It was difficult to make changes to my reservation because no one was truly fluent in english. We will recommend this hotel to any friends visiting Madrid and wil stay here again.

<Content>Loved This Hotel I stayed here with my friend last September and we found it to be so conveniently located it was ridiculous. You are 3 steps to the train stop and in the HEART of the action. We found the hotel to be clean and nice, the staff was helpful and accommodating. The absolute best part of this hotel was that it was average price for and above average location.

<Content>Good Hotel The Hotel is situated next to the Metro station Sol making it very easy to get anywhere in Madrid very cheaply. The Hotel is basic but very clean and the staff were very helpful. The room had air conditioning and double glazing so it was quiet in the room at night. I would stay here again. The only slightly negative point was the breakfast which was quite expensive for what was on offer and bearing in mind the local bars on the street outside offered the same for much less.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel This is a three star that is much better than the rating would suggest. It is one of the best, most friendly, clean and well located hotels you can find in any city and definitely in Madrid.The hotel staff is helpful, eagar to offer suggestions, directions and quick to respond to any request. Most speak English and all employees appeared to love their jobs, giving good service and the hotel. The owner is available in this family owned and run hotel and is involved with employees and issues and the staff spoke favorably of the management--always a good sign of a well run operation. The rooms were larger than could be expected in a 3 star, the decor was modern (the name) and well appointed, the bathroom was large with lots of light and hot water (always a plus for me) with fluffy robes (yes, robes in a 3 star). The room, the halls and the entire hotel was well maintained and extremely clean. The lounge and meeting rooms (also breakfast room with reasonably priced food) on the 2nd floor were spacious and very attractive--an excellent place to meet friends and/or business associates. Maid service was both efficient and done with a smile showing geniue concern for the guests. A minor maintenance problem was reported and within minutes people arrived to examine and fix the issue. In fact, this was a hallmark of everyone with whom I interacted--great and friendly service. A very well run and managed hotel. The hotel could not be better located. It is in the heart of many of the 'must see' tourist attractions such as the Plaza Major (tourist office located in this plaza), the Royal Palace and the Opera House. Even though the hotel is in the heart of the Puerta del Sol area the noise level was quite low for sleeping. However, the excitment of the area with lots of shopping, bars, eating places, etc. is great fun. There are always people on the street, performers exhibiting their talent and good people watching. The Metro is just steps out of the front door of the hotel which makes travel everywhere in the city easy, convenient, safe and inexpensive--even to and from the airport.I have only been home a few days but I have recommended this hotel to my friends and family and I plan on returning as often as possible. The whole hotel experience was one of the highlights of my visit to Madrid. Don't miss the chance to enjoy this special place, Hotel Moderno.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel I booked Hotel Moderno after extensive research on centrally located Madrid Hotels. Moderno is located literally in the very heart of Madrid - right at Puerta del Sol, the central square, from which many streets radiate. It is also only a few seconds away from the Sol subway entrance. We had a room on the top floor, facing Puerta del Sol. Our room had a huge balcony. It was quite a sight to watch hordes of people walking through the square way into the wee hours of the morning. We did not find it to be noisy, but then again we are used to city life. Overall, we had a very positive experience at the hotel. The front desk people were particularly helpful.

Recent renovations made rooms even more enjoyable.The new living rooms are better; more pleasant now.The hotel is in the middle of everything, from restaurants to shops, caffes, historic places, theaters, etc. Service and accomodation are for sure worth much more then we paid for.

<Content>Moderno by name - perfecto by nature My girlfriend and I stayed here for three nights at the end of November and we were very pleased with the hotel. We arrived around 11am and our room was ready, check in took a few minutes with plenty of smiles. The room we got was 206 and was overlooking the quiet street at the back of the hotel. It was small but had everything you could need, a very comfy double bed, large wardrobes and a spotless bathroom. The cleaning staff were friendly and unobtrusive and cleaned the room and replaced the towels each day.The location is fantastic, literally at the metro stop and within walking distance to most of the city sights. The metro is a great asset to the city, it makes getting around very easy and it is used by everyone. We didn't notice any pickpockets at any stage, but we were careful not to be showing cash or making any bags easily accessible. Madrid is a great city and the Hotel Moderno really helped us to enjoy our break, the location is excellent, the rooms were very pleaseant to stay in, the cleanliness was second to none and the staff were very friendly.

<Content>overall great hotel I stayed here with a group of friends for a weekend trip. The hotel is in a great location, and because we had rooms facing in to the courtyard rather than out on to the street was very quiet despite being in a busy area - I would request that.We had rooms for four which were great value for large groups. Decoration was very modern and rooms fine in terms of space. Very clean and well attended. We didn't make breakfast so I couldn't comment on that.

<Content>Nice Hotel; Great Location My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Moderno for five days during the early part of October, 2007. We arrived in Madrid via train from Toledo, and took the metro to Puerta Del Sol, knowing that the hotel was nearby. We spotted the hotel immediately upon emerging from the Puerta Del Sol metro station, literally a mere stone's throw away. The helpful staff efficiently checked us in, and we were off on our adventures in Madrid. The location of Hotel Moderno is nearly perfect for both people who like to walk a lot, as my wife and I do, and for users of public transit. Plaza Mayor, for example, is only about a five-minute walk away. The street upon which Hotel Moderno is situated, Arenal, is a broad pedestrian walkway lined with interesting shops and restaurants.  In addition to seeing the sights and visiting the wonderful museums in Madrid, we were interested in learning more about, and purchasing, some Spanish olive oil to take home with us. Upon inquiry of the hotel staff regarding shops specializing in olive oil, we were, given not only the name of and directions to such a shop, but also a short course in Spanish olive oil, including history, geographic origins, and taste characteristics of classic varities such as picual, hojiblanca, and arbequina, including a sample tasting! The lobby of the hotel is relatively small, but very welcoming. Our room was small, but comfortable, with a roomy outdoor deck overlooking the pedestrian avenue,Arenal.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Madrid at the Hotel Moderno, and would certainly recommend it to others.

<Content>Great Little Hotel I travelled to Madrid alone and spent 2 days as a single lady in Madrid before rendezvousing with my husband. The hotel staff at the Moderno were very helpful, especially the nice young man from Miami who went out of his way to help me with all my questions. I felt very safe at the Moderno, even though it is centrally located and the streets are very busy until the wee hours of the morning. The windows are absolutely soundproof and the noise below didn't reach my room. The common areas of the hotel, the restaurant, etc are beautifully decorated and the rooms, though small and typically European, were spotless and comfortable. My only complaint was that there were no English speaking television stations....but I suppose I wasn't really in Madrid to watch TV. It is well located for shopping and there is an excellent wine and cheese shop just across the street which is perfect for hotel room snacking. The breakfasts were very good and all in all, I'd go back again for another stay.

<Content>Unhelpful Staff The front desk staff was close to useless. There were major theater and music festivals going on in the city during our stay that the front desk knew nothing about. We had to ask a random passerby on the street to get headed in the right direction.There was a sign on the frot desk alerting checkin customers that cabs to the airport must be aranged 48 hours in advance. However, when we checked in there was a large map covering this notice. The front desk staff further neglected to verbally mention it to us. We almost missed our flight.

<Content>Be alert to ServiRed Our complaint is that at the time of check-out, they showed us an invoice with prices quoted in euros, and then handed us a paper slip to sign that secretly had figures in US dollars. What they did was to use the service called ServiRed, which has its own conversion rate and automatically adds a 3% mark-up. There was no oral explanation and we only noticed this later. Though we had a special credit card that incurs no transaction fee, we were not able to use this feature of our card, and the hotel and ServiRed took advantage of our need for currency exchange. The practice seems ubiquitous, at least in Madrid.

<Content>Best 3 star Euro Style Hotel ever! Got reservation online thru Venere. if you understand what a Euro style hotel is rather than a US hotel a la holiday Inn or Marriott, etc. then this is a great place. On the other hand, if you don;t know the difference, why are you on this web site? yes, the rooms are smallish by US standards, but they are absolutely immaculate, clean as can be. Bright, completely modernized (yes it is an old building that's been redone. even the public bathroom are sanitized. Twin beds etc. As I said, Euro style 3 star. But for the price, fantastic! Stayed a week, would go back in a heartbeat! Also Location in the heart of the city. In Sol 50 feet from the Sol metro station, And i had a room on the 2nd floor facing the street, but with the window and inner wooden shutters closed even on Saturday night it was dead quiet. Try that at any hotel next to times Sq in NYC!. Some complaints about the 10E price for Breakfast buffet. Well, the cafes nearby charge 3.5E for a small cup of coffee and a roll, so for a full all u can eat 10 bucks ant bad, especially if you plan on touring and they don't plan on lunch till 2 o'clock.my only off comment was that the front desk crew, while they could not have been more super nice or more helpful, were mostly conversant primarily only in Spanish and only a little bit of English. But this seems true of most of Madrid. They seem to want tourists but don't know what to do with them. This is a hotel for knowledgeable travelers, if that decsribes you, this can be your home in Madrid.

The facilities as well as all the personnel are first rate, and they make available very thoughtful and fine accessories such as the bath soaps and towels. In addition they have an excellent breakfast (especially the cured 鈥渟errano鈥?ham), good comfortable beds, and ample and safe bathrooms with a generous stream of water. The rooms have privacy and are virtually sound proof. Our experience was excellent and we recommend the hotel without reservation. We will definitely be back!

<Content>Great Location I have been using this hotel for at least 25 years - the manager, Don Julian has been there forever and he always recognises my wife and me! The street has recently been pedestrianized but taxis are permitted to enter the street to leave hotel guests although some do not realise this and will leave their passengers by the Metro exit on Puerto del Sol - this means a walk of 30 meters to the hotel entrance. Well worth it! The breakfasts are superb.

<Content>Great Location You cannot beat this hotel for location.The front door is merely yards away from Sol and the underground (there is a bit of noise from the trains in the hotel). It is surrounded by noise, bars, road works etc but you haven't come to Madrid for the peace and quiet.The hotel is quite stuffy - even in February it was very warm - but the rooms are nice enough and the staff are very helpful. The hotel does not have its own bar (but there are enough nearby) and I didn't have breakfast here so I cannot comment.Overall, it is a comfortable, central place to stay in Madrid. It might not be the best hotel in Madrid, but if you can get a good enough price then I suggest you give it a try.

Metro stop outside front door. Coffee shops and a couple of restaurants near. Chocolateria San Gines nearby (extremely important). Pharmacy next door. Rooms were small, clean, cozy and the street sounds were completely muffled by soundproof window/door thingies. A safe was in the room (pay per use). Staff was helpful - they helped me find a charming non-Starbucks coffee shop that was off the beaten path. Bathrooms well appointed, but not huge. Overall, a good value.

<Content>Group booking....Great Hotel...fantastic staff! Just back from a work 'Social Club Weekend' in Madrid. 33 of us in total..were looked after exceptionally in this great, central Hotel. From the initial contact booking..right through to checkout..cant fault it. Suggestions for suitable restaurant, obtain tickets for events, transport from airport..everything was offered to us before our arrival. All staff were very pleasant to deal with, rooms were great and varied. Some had french doors, some balconies and all had good size bathrooms, somewhat unusual for most European hotels. Breakfast also was great, and available up to 11am. Its a very central location, with plenty of bars/restaurants/shops right on the doorstep...and a couple of nightclubs down the road, but far enough not to be a nuisance. This should more or less cover all types of Visitors' requirements in this great city...and the Moderno was a very relaxed environment for us to retire to..at the end of our party nights! Highly recommend..and indeed intend to stay there again myself! Well done Moderno!

<Content>Great stay at the Moderno We spent a week at the Moderno. The location was excellent, just steps from the Puerto del Sol, and close to Plaza Mayor. The room was not very large, but very clean. The bathroom was modern had a full tub and shower, and was good sized. Breakfast was very good with a selection of pastries and meats, coffee, juices and fruit. There was also the option of eggs cooked to order. The staff was very helpful, especially the manager. All but one spoke reasonably good English and most were knowledgeable about local sites, restaurants and transportation. They assisted us with reservations. There is a lot of construction in the area and it is very noisy on the street, but our room was in the back, and with the windows closed, was very quiet. The air conditioning worked very well. We also had a balcony with a few chairs and a small table. The hotel is also set up for wireless internet and they are opening a new lounge area with a big screen TV and computer stations. We would definitely recommend the Moderno.

<Content>noisy and small We stayed from Sept. 18-22 in room 608. There is construction all over the sidewalk and street in front and a view of a street and construction from our balcony. The double set of windows keep out most of the noise but the airconditioning was broken most of the time so the windows had to be open because it was warm and stuffy. Construction stops about 2:00 AM and starts at 5:30 AM. One younger man at the desk was very nice and helpful but the other two would always give me very basic directions without street names which made my location hard to find even with their map. I was told about the breakfast times but when I asked about cost I was told 10 euros so I would recommend asking before you eat. The location for sightseeing is good but the room was very small. I would not stay there again.

Although there was extensive refurbishment ongoing on several floors, our room with a terrace was clean comfortable and quiet.The room has air conditioning and even leaving the window open we could hear the noise in the street which was not a problem. Its location was brilliant, the tour bus just opposite and the side streets full of cafes and bars,and the staff were very helpful.

<Content>A Gem I am in Madrid often as part of my research in the Spanish Middle Ages. In addition, I direct a study-abroad program for US college students in Spain. All these activities keep me a Madrid regular. I consider the Hotel Moderno a gem of a hotel. It's impossible to beat the location: right off the Puerta del Sol, within walking distance of the Opera, the Royal Palace, the Cibeles fountain, the Prado, etc. Despite being in a busy area, the rooms are extremely quiet due to what seems to be some special sound-proofing glass on the windows. (But those on the front side can sill open up to enjoy a balcony overlooking Calle Arenal.) The bathrooms are magnificent: large, spotless, and some with marble floors and walls. The rooms are comfortable, with television, music, etc. I love the all-cotton, plush sheets. I've stayed in both single rooms (with a comfortable double bed) and doubles (with two individual beds). The buffet breakfast will satisfy the heartiest of appetites. The lounge on the second floor--simply, yet elegantly, appointed with sofas, chairs and occasional tables--is a great place to chat with friends. A real treat for me is having Wi-Fi internet access directly from my room and at absolutely no extra charge. I've gotten a bit spoiled and can't stand what I have to pay for internet service at some other hotels.One of the biggest plusses of the Moderno is the staff: attentive, genuinely friendly, and extremely knowledgable about sites and activities. After a couple of stays I began to feel like family--something that has made all the difference on quite a few trips back. And the prices are quite favorable--especially given Spain's on-going escalation in price.

<Content>Great Small Hotel in the Heart of Madrid I just spent 18 great days in Madrid. My primary goals were to see the Bull fight Festival of San Isidro; visit Madrid's great Museums and experience the great food of Spain. Hotel Moderno provided the perfect location- 50 meters to the Metro at Puerta del Sol; a 5 minute walk to Plaza Mayor and walking distance to the Prado. The hotel rooms are small but quiet and comfortable with modern bathrooms and comfortable beds. The staff is focused on customer satisfaction. They were great help in getting tickets for the bullfights and in providing guidance and recommendations during my 18 day tour of Madrid. I would not miss the opportunity for a repeat visit. A great small European Hotel.

<Content>In the heart of magic Madrid! I booked this hotel for my partner and I as a surprise for his birthday. I chose the hotel after reading of it's location as it was important that we were in the middle of things. We certainly were! We got the metro from the airport to Metro Sol. This was amazing value! Took around 1hr 15 ish with a couple of changes and cost a mere 1 euro!!! We were astounded and very glad we didn't get a taxi, which most tour operators offer at 拢40 each way! Don't do it unless you have walking difficulties ( there are steps at the metro stations like the London Underground but there are escalators for the deeper climbs!) We had concerns over metro safety but I felt completely safe! As long as you don't flash your cash and just be a bit aware of pick pockets (as with any city!) you will be fine.We had our map ready to try and find the hotel but as we came out of the Metro Sol, a few feet away was the Moderno! We checked into our room which was small clean and comfortable. The bathroom had excellent facilities (including a hairdryer). We had a veranda which looked out onto errr... a department store! But you didn't expect to see the sea did you? The windows had fantastic sound proofing! With the windows open it was very noisy, but shut you wouldn't know you were in the centre of this vibrant city! There is air conditiong so if you go in summer don't worry about having noise because you can keep your windows shut and turn the a/c on!The staff were friendly and you can leave your (bulky) hotel key with them when you are going out for the night. There is a safety deposit box which works by popping a euro coin in each time you wish to secure it so your belongings are perfectly safe.I would go on and tell you how wonderful Madrid is but it would take up a web page! Believe me, if you appreciate good food, culture, friendly people and long party nights...get on a flight now!

<Content>Noisy Moderno We stayed for couple of nights at the Moderno in November 2005. Then we had to change the hotel because of the noise from the very near building site. They are building a metro stop/entrance beside hotel Moderno and the El Corte Ingl茅s -department store and the noise can be very bad from the quite early morning to late afternoon/night. We had our room at the second floor and they promised us a different room for the following night, but we really didn't believe it would make a lot of difference. It would be helpful to tell about these kind of contruction work at the hotel website, but obviously there is little chance of that happening.Otherwise the hotel is ver well located and the reception staff is friendly enough. Our double room was very small tough.

<Content>Great Location Stayed March 18-20th with my 2 daughters. Very convenient location. We walked to the Palace, Cathedral, Plaza Mayor(great place for eating lunch outside with all of the entertainment--musicians, acrobats, mime type statues.....on a beautiful day!), Retiro Park, Prado. Be sure to wear your most comfortable shoes if you plan to walk to all the sites. My teenage daughter had a blister within the first hour from wearing the wrong shoes! Our room was small but very clean. 3 twin beds, marble floors and bathroom was all tile. PUll UP on the silver knob on the top back of the toilet to flush. I hadn't traveled Europe for awhile, it took me a minute to figure it out! HA! My daughters had a good laugh at me! When we checked in, they had us down for the wrong rate, they tried to say it was for the breakfast. I showed them a copy of my reservation--It didn't seem to matter to her(desk clerk) much..... My much less expensive rate INCLUDED breakfast.....Since my daughter has been studying there for several months, she knew a fair amount of Spanish, so she argued for me to get the rate we had booked thru the 800 domestic number. (the gal at the desk was not comfortable speaking English) We did not get it resolved the first day,which made me feel very uncomfortable starting the trip out, but when I checked out, the young gentleman at the desk that day, knew Engish very well, so it all worked out. I received my original rate.Breakfast suited us just fine---juices,fruit,coffee, pastries, interesting crackers, lunch meat, cheeses, jams, cereal---a glorified continental breakfast. The electricity is interesting. You have to put the key card (which is attached to the real skeleton door key!) in a slot to work the lights just inside the door. We had no air conditioning (they said it was still too early in the season for it to run), so the room got uncomfortably stuffy for all of us. UPon opening the window, the street noise was too much, (we were there on a friday and saturday night) so we had to close it again. (The revelers are out singing and talking loudly from midnight to 3-4am...)Great for a good laugh, but not for sleeping. (o: However, With the windows in the sleeping area closed, the noise does not penetrate--seemingly soundproof, so to get air ventilation, we had to open the bathroom window (no screens) since there was no air conditioning or fans. We slept quite comfortably then. Beds were very comfortable for us.I would stay there again because of the handy location and cleanliness. (The maids were washing the walls in the hallways!) Be prepared to pay for the nice location. You can get an English speaking desk clerk if you need it. The desk manager knows English if you have to straighten out your bill--you may have to ask for him. Just be sure and bring your Hotel confirmation letter, and please be kind. They were still quite kind to us, even though we had to argue the bill in the beginning. I was trying not to be a belligerant, demanding American when traveling to another country. We are used to having higher expectations, and I tried to keep in mind that I was a guest in another culture, where the way of living and doing things is different from what I'm used to.

<Content>Perfect for my purposes For a single traveller, my smallish double accommodation was good size and superlatively equipped, with decor that was of high standard and clearly recent. E.g. solid dark-wood headboards and doors, fully-marbled bathroom, quality curtains and blinds and (I counted!) 16 beautiful mahogany-style coat-hangers. I presume I had a room which had been `done up' as some other reviews below sound very different.But of course the stand-out feature is the position, which is 20 metres from where they measure distances from in Spain! A thrill to walk out the door and be at the absolute the centre of everything -- starting with the amazing Mallorquina patisserie/cafe (open 8.00-21.15 daily) across the road which is a Madrid institution and hugely recommended.With early March nightime temperatures one obviously wants to sleep with the double-glazed windows closed, and on that basis no problem. Maybe it could be later. Otherwise the perfect choice and outstanding value. You'd pay at least double as much in (my native) London for anything remotely comparable.

<Content>great location This is a very clean and comfortable hotel right in the center of Madrid. The bathroom was very nice for European standards. Most Spanish hotels I've stayed in do not offer double beds, this is no exception. The breakfast is nice, but not a bargain. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nice Place I stayed at Hotel Moderno in March (2004) with my family. I think it was a very nice place. Staff was friendly and it was in a good location. The rooms were a little small. In our room there were four single beds in one room, a short hallway, and then a nice bathroom. There was also a breakfast included which was nice because we did not have to go out and buy it. Overall i would say it was a good experience and a nice hotel.
