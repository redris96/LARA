<Content>Wonderful place to stay The lobby is beautifuuly restored and decorated with so many interesting things. You walk out the door and are within walking distance of restaurants and stores. Even when I walked alone I felt safe. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The room is large with 2 beds and a pull out couch, a table and chairs, a large closet and an extra large bathroom. The room had 2 large windows to open and the air conditioner worked very well. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel and excellent value for money We stayed here for three nights over Christmas 2007 and had an excellent stay. The rooms are really big, comfortable and clean and include everything you could possibly need. The staff were really friendly and extremely helpful when we asked them for advice. The location of the hotel is a little bit of a walk from the Metro station but there are many restaurants, shops and bars in walking distance and Condessa and the Historic Centre are only a short taxi ride away. The only downfall was perhaps the restaurant, which wasn't great but there are so many other cafes and restaurants close by that this wasn't a problem. I think Hotel Geneve provides fantastic value for money and I would happily recommend this hotel to anybody travelling to Mexico City.

<Content>Average Hotel We stayed here for a week in July of 2007. This hotel is located in the pink zone. The hotel looked just as we expected from the photos, clean and no frills. Since we were planning on spending most of our time out exploring the city it was fine for us. Our room had two double beds which were a bit hard, but not terribly uncomfortable. The room was pretty large with a tv, alarm clock, telephone, and ironing board. The bathroom was marble and clean with a built-in hairdryer and some simple toiletries. Towels were abundant for two people and replaced everyday by housekeeping. The carpet in the room was a bit worn and could have either used replacing or a deep cleaning. The room had air conditioning, but it worked very poorly in the summer weather. There were sliding windows that opened (no screens), but we kept them closed for safety reasons. We were also able to get WiFi access in our room after a couple of days (initially it was down). I should note that depending on which staff member we asked, we got a different price for the WiFi service. We finally found out from the manager that it was actually free! Thankfully we averted that scam! There are two restaurants on site, one comparable to Denny's here in the states and another that is typical of an average Mexican restaurant. The food was average at both places and reasonably priced. There is also a shop attached that sells a hodgepodge of merchandise. It's good if you are in a pinch for toothpaste or postcards, but the prices are rather high for average goods (we payed $16 US for sunscreen!).The hotel neighborhood is ok, but definitely past its prime. Across from the hotel is a very small mall with an Italian restaurant, food court, Starbucks, and clothing stores. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and we actually walked to almost all of the tourist attractions from the hotel. It was close to one of the red tourist bus stops which is a must for any tourist who wants to see the entire city. At night the area seems to be filled with young people and a bit sketchy (there are a few strip clubs in the area). We didn't venture past the mall after dark.. If we were to travel to Mexico City again, we would probably not stay in this neighborhood again, but closer to the historical center.

<Content>Great choice Just got back from a 6 night stay. The hotel is outstanding. very clean, large rooms. Staff very friendly. The sanborns restaurants are overpriced as expected. But, go across the street to a small indoor mall and there is a diner style restaurant, pretty good.Internet is 150 pesos for 24 hours. Expensive but worth it if you don't want to work outside the hotel. Boingo is also available for 10 dollars a day, but not a very strong signal.Excellent location. Safe at night. Plenty of nghtlight. Some very good restaraunts. Billinghausen, an Italian place across the street, relatively cheap compared to some places. The Argentinian steak house was outstanding.

<Content>A Wonderful Place I was part of a large group that spent about 10 days in M茅xico City in June of 2006. My stay was great, in part because of this wonderful hotel. The rooms were good; a little crowded with lots of furniture. Working safes in the closet. Cable TV selection is decent with subtitles on everything. Room service was prompt and very good. Beds were super comfortable but that's personal preference. Always spotless. There is a fairly large store inside the hotel for things you might have forgotten at home like pharmacy/drug-store type things, and bottled water.The location of the hotel is excellent. I love the energy and vibrancy of Mexico City, and there is plenty of that here. You are just a few blocks or miles from all the important Mexico City places (Plaza de Bellas Artes, the Z贸calo, shopping, etc.). Plenty of great restaurants nearby. There's a computer caf茅 right next door that was only about 10 to 20 pesos an hour (about $2 USD). The little mall across the street is lame, but I especially liked the 2 story bookstore on the corner; they have an eclectic collection of CDs and DVDs and they play live music in the afternoons from the 2nd floor stage. Also a huge music store across the street. For shopping, don't freak out and go all the way to Wal-Mart; behind the hotel near the subway station is a little street mercado and you can get everything you need there and also spend time among locals. Another mercado is a few blocks in the other direction and is very extensive. Bargaining is encouraged. The 7-11 is also around the corner. Around the hotel is noisy, but my room was nice and relatively quiet. The location is also very gay-friendly if that interests you. The staff was GREAT. I forgot my iron and they lent it to me for the entire week. It broke and another one arrived within 10 minutes. Then, they didn't even mind when I mistakenly left it in my friend's room at the end of my stay. I was surprised by how often they came to the room; once to clean it, once to change sheets, once to pick up the dry cleaning. Always at exactly the same time. Also, once I stayed behind from the group and remained in the hotel because I was sick (not from this hotel--picked it up elsewhere in Mexico). I met the limpieza (housekeeper) while she cleaned and she told me what to do to get better, and she told me about her family  her life there and we taught each other a few words of objects in the room.The food is just so-so. After 10 days, we couldn't stand the breakfast at Sanborn's anymore and we just were eating it for sustenance. The service in the front restaurant and at the front desk was just okay--they were polite and met our needs but seemed a little overwhelmed. They got especially annoyed if we tried to get change for smaller bills. The servers in the rear restaurant were really helpful and nice.Do hold on to your purse  wallet--if you walk purposefully and as if you know where you're going (even if you don't--just pretend) you will be okay. The police can actually be nice to you; you can ask them for directions. I felt about as safe here as I do walking around in any large city--and this even as a woman occasionally walking alone.Go see all the typical Mexico stuff, it's worth it, but also, check out the post office nearby--very beautiful for photos. Have a great time and enjoy Hotel Gen猫ve. :)

<Content>I like the hotel... Very Quant and Old-World Majesty The rooms were lovely...and it was in a very elegant and colourful district.I loved the restarant, especially during breakfast. The view and scenery was charming and so very very welcoming. If you take a look at the restaurant pics yourself...the beauty of the surrounding is even more impressive in real life.S  R WensingCanada

<Content>average hotel Location. It 麓s two blocks from Reforma Ave., so, if you arrive there at night do not be impressed by the dark, scary neighborhood , since it麓s safe to walk around. We found the area full of gay friendly cafes and discos.Room. it was ok, comfortable rooms, small but clean bathroomsService. Housecleaning was good, reception desk service was good once you get used to the rude manners of the localsRestaurants. the restaurant giving on to the street was always full, and service was not good. The colonial one, is much more quiet and you get much better service. Attention non smokers: both restaurants allow smoking , and even if there are smoking and non smoking sectors, you might get seated close to a smoking table.TIP: if you want to see the most important sights in Mexico City and surroundings stay longer than we did, just 3 days, you need at least five days. Next time, I will stay in the Zocalo area, because you are in the historical district which is much more interesting than the Zona Rosa.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location My partner and I stayed at this hotel for four nights in January 07. The hotel's location is great, right in the middle of the Zona Rosa with dozens of restaurants and clubs and stores all around. The staff was pleasant and helpful, if a little at loose ends at times. Our room was not luxurious, with furniture and carpeting that have probably seen years of service, but it was clean and quiet and actually rather charming.One suggestion: go to Fonda del Refugio for dinner. It's just a block or two from the hotel on Liverpool Street. It was the best of many good meals that we had in Mexico City.

<Content>A very classy hotel in the pedestrian Zona Rosa in Mexico city The hotel is in the middle of the Zona Rosa, pedestrian streets, outdoor better restaurants clubs , pubs and at the edge of the gay district. As per our request our very large room looked over a courtyard. Very quiet, the bed was very large and the linens high thread contents. The bathroom was a bit small however very well appointed. There is a safe. The AC worked very well. Hotel Calinda made excellent suggestions as to our visit.We stayed 5 days. We walked to the center of Mexico city ( maybe 3 kms), the Metro station is nearby and there are always special licensed turismo cabs. ( a lot cheaper) in front of the hotel. The hotel has 2 restaurants, we liked Sanborns for breakfast where the help wear colourful costumes. The other restaurant is nicer to look at and the food is so-so. There is a work out room and a very large business room. The staff at the check-in desk seems to be polyglot. ( I speak Spanish, so we did not have any language problems).Evry body was courteous and smiling. We shall go back and stay at the Hotel Calinda Geneve. Mich and JordanSeattle

<Content>Hospitality, Convenience  I arrived with 39 other people and we were highly surprised at the wonderful restaurant and lobby that greeted us. The back restaurant is breathtakingly beautiful.Our hosts were professional and quickly helped us with our luggage.The hotel is close to everything one could possibly need to make a visit here exciting and fun. Shopping and Nightclubs are all over the area.The rooms are very nice and the beds are on the firm side ( I slept like a baby) For those who aren't very adventurous there are plenty of places within a few steps of the hotel to eat ie: italian, steakhouse, McDonalds, Burger King, Popeyes, and etc!I loved our stay here, and will return to this hotel the next time I visit Mexico City

<Content>Solid Choice in the Zona Rosa! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Calinda Geneve last month for one week. I chose the hotel based on the good reviews on this site and its central location in the city. When we arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that the hotel looked much more attractive in person than on the web photos, inside and out! It is a very charming, older style hotel with no more than 5-6 floors. There is a Sitio taxi stand right outside on the street and 2 Sanborns restaurants, Sanborns store (which sells a little bit of everything from CDs, toiletries, water/sodas, magazines, books, etc), and a comfy bar/lounge on the first floor. The staff we came in contact with at checkin and throughout our stay were very pleasant and most helpful. We do both speak spanish which was a plus, but I did notice staff making every effort to help tourists that didn't.Our room was located on the 2nd floor and had 2 double beds, a dresser, desk/chair, TV armoire and minibar. There was also a safe in the wall closet, which was good size. The room was a good size for us and never did I feel like there wasn't enough space. The bathroom had a full tub with shower and wasn't a closet like you find in some hotels. The only little problem we had was that the water would leak from the tub to the floor a bit, but there was a drain nearby under the sink so that took care of that. There was a small but nice and well maintained gym on our floor with a few treadmills, step machine, bicycles, free weights and other weight machines available. There is an attendant there and free towels and water are never a problem. There was an adjoining spa but we did not use it. They offered massages and other treatments and also had a steam room and sauna.We enjoyed the central location of this hotel. There were restaurants, stores (a small mall is across the street), an internet cafe and even the american chains like Starbucks, B King, 7-11 etc nearby (I was surprised to see that! But I guess it is a big international city). The Zona Rosa is a very lively area with a good mix of people (it is also the gay district), so we felt safe walking around even at night. There were some small streets that were a little dark but just use your common sense and be street smart. It did get loud a few nights that we were there with all the clubs, but luckily our window wasn't right on the street so it didn't bother us at all. La Reforma and the Angel (it is under renovation right now unfortunately) is a 5 min walk and even though we didn't take the Metro, one of the stops was a short walk away. I recommend taking the Turibus to get acquainted with the city and see alot of the sights, especially if you are short on time - it is a great deal! Do see the Zocalo/Metro Cathedral/National Palace, the Anthropology Museum, the pyramids, and the Basilica. Also we found a very cute, quaint restaurant with goooood Mexican food not too far from the hotel on Liverpool St called La Fonda del Refugio. It was great!Overall I recommend the Calinda Geneve and I will stay there again!

<Content>Great Staff!!! My family and I stayed in April for two nights. The service was fantastic! they really were the best! From the moment we pulled up in the taxi they took care of everything. The only issue was the small rooms. No room in the bathroom to towel off. It's really more like a closet. Zona Rosa is a colorfull neighborhood. Their are a few decent restaurants and the U.S. Embassy is an easy 3 block walk. For the price and location it's a great value. The staff really make this hotel shine!
