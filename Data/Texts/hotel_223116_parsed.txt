<Content>Great place to get away We were lucky to get to stay at this Drury Suites while it was beautifully decorated for Christmas! VERY clean. Friendly staff. Great location. My only complaint would be that the bathroom in the guest rooms was very small.

<Content>Whole Lotta Good Stuff at the Drury We stayed at the Drury for the New Orleans Bowl 2008. Got a two room suite with a jacuzzi. It's worth the few extra dollars. Very nice physical facility. Very clean; classy but up-to-date. The personnel were all very helpful. No concierge on duty while we were there, but the young woman at the reservation desk was just as helpful with directions to restaurants, sights, etc. Free breakfast, free drinks (limit 3) and snacks in the evening help offset the small $15 parking charge. Good location, too. About equal distance between the Superdome and the Riverwalk. Easy walking to the French Quarter.

<Content>Loving the Drury We just returned from a weekend stay at the Drury in New Orleans, LA and what a wonderful surprise. This was my first time to stay at a Drury and is was awesome - the staff was great, the hotel was beautiful, and the extras......afternoon snacks, evening socials, added security access in the elevators was a bonus and we got a great rate through their web-site !

<Content>Loved IT!! Will stay here on next visit!! Drury Inn New Orleans was excellent!! My room was a nice size and always clean. The free snacks (popcorn, nachos, vegetables, peanuts, chips and salsa)  free drinks were a nice touch in the evenings. The lobby is beautiful and the location is prime. Maybe 3 blocks from Bourbon and 2 blocks from the Superdome. There is also a trolley stop on the corner near the hotel if you don't want to walk. Because they are not right on Bourbon and Canal streets there is free parking. (Some hotels in that area charge $30 a night for parking.) Wireless Internet access was free and so were long distance phone calls.This is definitely my hotel of choice when returning to New Orleans!!

<Content>Heartily Recommended Choose this hotel for a conference in New Orleans because of the reviews on tripadvisor. In actual fact turned out to be much better! I had a large room facing away from the river although with a large tub. Fantastic space in room, with free local  national calls and free wi-fi. All staff were excellent  welcoming - a problem with my phone was dealt with in an hour and the engineer left a card in case of further problems - great attention to detail. The hotel has a free breakfast (cereals, pastries and some hot items), a roof-top exercise room, small pool and jacuzzi (good enough for a bit of relaxing at the end of the day) and gives you snacks and free drinks in the early evening. All up a very good place to stay and heartily recommended. Congratulations and thanks to the staff.

<Content>We Love Drury Inn at New Orleans.... Beautiful Hotel situated in a great location. Only 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street or tram right outside the door.Staff were all very courteous and helpful. Room was absolutely beautiful. King Size Bed in a huge room, big bathroom. Rooms were immaculate and very, very comfortable.Drury Inn serve free drinks and nibblies late afternoon. We enjoyed this at the end of our day.Our highlight of New Orleans was doing the Katrina Bus Tour. It was 3 hours very well spent and would recommend this to anyone visiting as staying in Downtown you wouldn't realise that anything had happened.

<Content>Good Hotel We had to book this hotel rather quickly for an unexpected trip to New orleans and where relieved to have found it. The staff where all very nice and sincere. The rooms where clean along with every other inch of the hotel. The roof top pool was great and it had a very nice view. Breakfast was incredible! We enjoyed it as much as we could (stuffed ourselves)! The only downfall of the hotel is that our room was never cleaned. House keeping needed more staff because it was late afternoon and nap time for the babies by the time they where able to clean our room. Our hair dryer didn't work also. I didn't bring my own because i thought I would have one. The worst part of our stay is the fact that you have to pay for parking. 15 dollars a day on top of the expensive room is alittle ridicoulus I would say. The hotel is walking distances from many attractions which would be good if we where there as tourists,

<Content>Thoroughly recommend this hotel! A*!!! What an absolutely fantastic hotel! The only thing we can think of to even contemplate complaining about was the eagerness of the staff to clean the room!! (we were on vacation and sometimes due to tropical rain we were still in the room or had just returned to base to freshen up when she tried to come in!!)Right thats out of the way, so I can get on with the good stuff!- it is right on the st charles street car route- buses are easily accessible on poydras- 5 min walk away from Canal St, which is ideal!- excellent security- friendly staff- free drinks, popcorn and nachos every night- free internet access- free breakfast (i miss the waffles now i'm back home :-( !!! )if going to NOLA thoroughly recommend this hotel. we were there for 14 nights and it was fab!!

<Content>The tops in customer service and amenities! I returned just 2 days ago from a visit to New Orleans and stay at the Drury Inn  Suites. This is one of the few hotels that I can not find a single negative thing to say. The location is convenient to the French Quarter but just far enough away to be peaceful and offer on-site parking for a modest fee.I was immediately impressed with the beauty of the lobby and friendliness of the front desk employees. This friendliness was indicative of every employee we encountered. How wonderful to be greeted by smiling faces each morning at breakfast. Also, the security measures are terrific. If entering through a door other than the main entrance a guest room card must be used. Also, a card is required to utilize the elevators that access the guest rooms. The same is true of the parking area.The guest room was of ample size and was spotless with a fresh non-perfume type fragrance. The king-size bed was amazingly comfortable along with the abundance of soft pillows! Each room has a microwave and refrigerator, which we didn't utilize because of the wonderful reception each evening in the lobby that offers 3 alcoholic beverages per guest and an assortment of munchies. Also, free coffee, soft drinks and popcorn are available throughout the day and evening. As if this isn't enough, the free hot breakfast buffet each morning offers a wide variety of foods including yogurt, fresh fruit, rolls, cereal, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, sausage, toast, bagels, and orange and apple juice.After checking out and returning to Ohio, I discovered I was missing my new prescription eyeglasses. This dampened the trip somewhat, until I logged online tonight to find a customer survey from Drury Inns. I completed it and mentioned, in the comment section, if someone found my glasses and returned them I would consider my visit over the top. In less than an hour I received an email from the manager saying the glasses were located and would be shipped to me the following day. Wow! I was stunned and delighted. This is the tops in Customer Service and you can bet I will seek out Drury Inns anywhere else I may travel. I definitely have been spoiled! Great job New Orleans Drury Inn manager and staff!

<Content>Good Value Hotel Stayed here for 4 nights recently with husband and 14 year old daughter. Chose hotel based on reviews written here.We were not disappointed. Hotel is well located, being about 10 min walk from the French Quarter and all its restaurants, bars etc.The room was a nice size with two double beds, and a separate lounge area.Internet access was free, as was breakfast each morning. Choice was reasonable but the disposable plates and cutlery spoilt it a bit. In the evenings, 5.30-7pm, at the managers reception you could have up to 3 drinks each which was also a nice touch.On the roof there is a small swimming pool which was never crowded, and there is also one washing machine and dryer for guests to use.All in all, good value for money, if all you want is a base while in New Orleans.

<Content>Good value hotel. Just returned from a nice stay at this hotel. It's a pleasant place to be, everywhere in New Orleans is accessible quite easliy from it, either by walking or on the trolley. It was slightly further from the French Quarter than we'd imagined, but it wasn't a problem.The hotel is good value for the price. The breakfast is good enough, although I wasn't keen on the disposable plates and cutlery. The cocktails are a nice idea, but again not quite the same served in plastic cups.The only other thing that I would pick up on is that, although we had a non-smoking room, there was a strong smell of smoke every so often. We decided it was filtering through the air-conditioning. The room, however was large, we had a bedroom with separate living area. There were two T.Vs, one in each room, a fridge and a microwave and it was all very clean.The pool area is very nice, with a lovely view of the city. The staff are all very friendly and helpful.Overall I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again.

<Content>Great location This hotel was perfect for us. They gave us two adjoining rooms. We walked to dinner and I have to say that the walk was very nice. Didn't see any panhandlers and it's far enough away from the French Quarter that you don't have to worry about someone swinging a door open and your kids getting a shot at some topless skank performing on stage. This area of New Orleans was not flooded. The hotel was clean, breakfast was free, and not bad though not fabulous. I would stay here again. It was very reasonable at 72.00 a room per night.

<Content>Very nice hotel There was a group of 6 that stayed at this hotel. My room had a great view of the river but the other rooms had a view of the ATT building right beside the hotel, so if a view is important I would suggest requesting it when you book. Coctails in NO are about $9 each at the restaurants so the 3 free coctails you get here everynight are a big plus. The parking is great and very secure. The only reason I would not give this hotel 5 stars is that the staff although friendly enough is not helpful at all. One thing I would highly recommend is to do some prior planning and get some good maps of the city and figure out the trolley system because it is a little confusing. I don't think I would stay here again only because there were some other hotels closer to the french quarter and although 4 blocks away doesn't sound like much by the 3rd day it is a lot because you have to walk 4 or 5 more blocks in the quarter to get anywhere. Overall, this is a great hotel.

Breakfast is ok. comlimentary drink in evening comes as bonus. overall a perfect place to stay and complete value for money.

Breakfast buffet very good and welcome reception at 5:30 pm with free coctails and appetizers was nice. My 2 teenage kids loved swimming on the roof top pool at night. Overlooked the city.This hotel is very convenient as it is in walking distance to the French Qtr, Bourbon St, Riverwalk, Superdome, etc. $15.00 parking fee at the hotel is reasonable. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Look at TRAVELOCITY for a great price!

The St Charles street car stops right next to the hotel for those of you that do not want to walk鈥?or can鈥檛 walk without stumbling. The street cars were still running at 2:00am when we were making our way back to the hotel. Five Stars in my book!!

The check-in process was very quick and simple and exceeded only by the even quicker check-out. The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable (with real feather pillows !!!!!!).The evening drinks and snacks were a very nice addition since we checked in right as they were being served. The breakfast served the next morning was very good quality. We will most definitely stay again and look forward to it!

<Content>New Orleans Drury Inn The Drury Inn in New Orleans is a nice place to stay for the price. They are within walking distance of the Mississippi River and the French Quarter. Their complimentary breakfast is extremely good and they also offer free drinks and snacks (nachos, fruit, popcorn, chips and dip) in the evening. The front desk staff was very friendly. The rooftop pool was small, but offered quite a view of the city. The hotel is very secure and you have to use your key card to access the elevators. The rooms were very clean, but were small as were the beds. We would stay there again.

<Content>Great place and reasonable price! I stayed here earlier this year for the Sugar Bowl. This is a really great place it is located on the same street (Poythress) as the Super Dome and Harrah's Casino, all are within walking distance. The hotel is very clean and the ceilings are about 12 foot tall with long windows. I guess it is a remodeled older building, it really adds a certain charm. They also have free breakfast, drinks, and popcorn. I stay here every time I go to the Big Easy.

<Content>Great Hotel A friend of mine and I went to the 2nd weekend of Jazzfest May 3 thru May 6. I booked a room at the Drury as I have stayed in Drury Inn's in the past and have always had great experiences. This one was no exception. We arrived well before the 3pm check in time and was greeted by a great staff at the front desk. We got our keys and headed up to the 6th floor to our room. It was clean, the beds were comfy, the bathroom was well kept, we were quite pleased. We were given tips on places to eat, how the trolley cars ran, the prices (1.25, EXACT change!). The quarter is within walking distance, took the trolley to the Garden District and visited a place called Cooter Brown's. They have a vast selection of beer and the folks there are quite friendly. The free breakfast was a nice touch, food was tasty, saved some $$$ eating in each morning. The cocktail hour is always a hit! I would recommend the Drury chain to anyone!ALSO: Don't pass up the Jazz Brunch at the Court of Two Sisters. It is served daily and is NOT to be missed!

<Content>Awesome value We have been to NOLA 3 times now, once pre-Katirna and twice post. We have stayed at the BW French Quarter and the W French Quarter besides this hotel, just so you get context. We travel a fair bit . This was by far the best bang-for-buck hotel we have ever stayed in ANYWHERE. we paid less than $100/night for 2 nights. The rooms was first rate, with 12 foot ceilings. The rooftop pool was perfect with great views of the city - the hot-tub was a great place to smoke a stogie and (I was careful) and the pool was well heated - vital for my 6 year old. The location was ideal as well as we were just a couple of blocks from the french quarter and near many excellent restaurants, as well my son and I walked to the D-day museum and the childrens museum from here and it took 10 minutes tops. However the best aspect of the hotel was the hot breakfast in the mornings and the 3 drinks each in the evenings. The breakfast ain't fancy (scrambled eggs etc) but it was just how I liked it, and no waiting or tipping (I did tip a buck a drink but not as much as I would wait staff). we spent our last night in NOLA at the W french quarter, very shishi, but I guess I care more about value than beautiful courtyards (how much time you gonna spend there anyway?)

<Content>Great Stay! Having not been to New Orleans since Katrina, I kept reading reviews of many Quarter hotels I had stayed in many times,in my lifetime as a Texan. I kept seeing TA reviews saying things were musty, or not as clean as expected...and the prices were No bargain! I applaud all that has been done in N.O., and I know it is a struggle to recover, but it helps to find Honest reviews, as TA has, and Know what you are getting into.Based on this, I booked us two nights at the Drury, during Jazz Festival; they had great room prices! The front desk staff is very helpful. We arrived in time for the snack and drinks reception, and Each got 3 glasses of wine.(they had a pretty full 'bar', I got tequila sunrises, as well one night) You get 3 drinks for each night you stay. We were in Room 202, it was non-smoking and very large...nice view of some of the buildings. comfortable king bed, fridge and microwaveand small coffee maker. The room was VERY clean, especially the bathroom.We then walked to the French Quarter, and even with my husband's recent knee replacement, it was an easy walk! We left Bourbon and that area about 11:45pm, and felt safe walking back to the Drury. There is always coffee and soft drinks available, as well, and we got a Pepsi to take up to our room.The trolly car line stops about 12 steps from the front door! Take it all the way down through the Garden District. Get off at the last stop before the trolley turns around to go back, and walk across the street behind you, and to the right, to the Camellia Grill. Excellent food; cheeseburgers, chili cheese omelettes, onion rings, and apple pie that they 'smoosh' onto the gril to warm for you, and top with ice cream--Wow!!! :)The breakfast at the hotel was also very good. Biscuits, country gravy, eggs, sausage, cereals, and make your own belgian waffles, as well as bagels and english muffins, yogurt and fruit. Again, added into the price we paid, it made this More of a bargain!I would def book here again, and am glad to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great New Orleans Hotel Stayed at the Drury Inn during the first week of Jazz Fest. Rate was considerably less than that of other area hotels and because of the good ratings here, I booked the room. Room was much better than I had even hoped. Ceilings were about 15ft high. 2 comfortable beds, recliner, desk and chair. Very nice bathroom. Every empoyee we came in contact with was very friendly.Free breakfast in the morning consisted of scrambled eggs and sausage (with salsa, ham and cheese to add to the eggs) biscuits and gravy, french toast, waffles and all the other breakfast items you would expect to see. Free popcorn and soft drinks thruout the day. At night, there was a free happy hour that consisted of 3 drinks, chips, cheese and salsa as well as other snacks. Free Wi-FI as well.Very easy walk to the French Quarter, less than 10 minutes. Streetcar also stops right in front of the hotel.We had a great stay and will definately be staying here again in the future.

<Content>What a Bargain I booked a room at the Drury Inn with some trepidation. An Inn sounds low end but I did not want to spend the ~200 that the other bigger name hotels were quoting. The reviews were consistently positive, so I decided to take a chance. When I arrived at the Hotel at 11:00 pm, the door had card secured entrance, which gave the impression of a safety issue. Even after checking in, the elevator required the use of your room key to go up and down. I am not sure why all this is in place, because the hotel is very nice and certainly seems very safe. The lobby is elegant, with high ceilings and good decor. The room, with a king bed and a jacuzzi, was a very pleasant surprise. It was quite large with ~14 foot ceiling and nice, tall windows. The bed and the furniture was of the level that I would have expected in a top grade hotel. The bathroom had marble tiled floor and walls. The only thing that was incongruous is the use of cheap soap, shampoo, and glasses, which were the disposable clear soft plastic variety that one finds in a motel. This is a minor issue. An added bonus is that they had unlimited free long distance calling and free wireless!!! I hate paying 10-20 extra for wireless on top of the 200+ rates at the better hotels. There was also free breakfast, but I did not try it. Overall, a fantastic value.

<Content>Great hotel near but not in the action Stayed at Drury Inn for 8 nights in March 08 while in NO for a Habitat build. The hotel was very nice, room was small but clean, the hot breakfast each morning was very much appreciated. Loved the location--near enough to all the action to walk to it, but far enough away that we could get a good night's sleep. Stayed in room 701, which was a King non-smoking at the end of a hallway. Weekends seemed fairly noisy, but during the week all was quiet. Staff was very helpful. Only complaint was that the room keycards consistently de-magnetized, even when we didn't have them near anything that should have cause it. Many others at the hotel having the same problem, so I don't think it was us. Was great having the fridge and microwave in the room so we could prepare our sandwiches for the next day. Parking was $15 per day, reasonable when compared to some of the other rates I saw. Walking in this area is much preferred to driving as there's quite a lot of construction going on, and the already narrow streets have lanes closed and all kinds of things to dodge.

<Content>FANTASTIC!!!! First of all,l let me say that I was very impressed. I have read other posts that say this hotel was nice but it wasn't a Marriott. I have stayed at many Marriotts and they are right, there are a lot more perks for the price here. Free breakfast, free long distance, free popcorn and beverages, etc.This hotel was in a good locaton, The price was very reasonable (90.00) and the person at the front desk was always very polite and helpful. I thought the free breakfast was good and the pool was very nice. The rooms were very clean and decorated well. In my opinon, this is a hidden gem and well worth the money! Oh yeah, very kid friendly!!!!I will be staying here next visit.

There's a microwave / fridge in the room. The only downside was no room service -- but we knew that in advance.

<Content>Not bad I stayed at the Drury Inn for four nights in early January. This was the weekend of the national football championship final between Iowa and LSU, and the hotel seemed to be full of people that had come to New Orleans for the game.My room was spacious, clean, and nice and I had free wireless access to the internet. The service was good. I wasn't too happy with the breakfast, although there was a selection of different foods, coffee, pops, etc. available. Considering the price range, I was quite happy with the hotel and wouldn't mind staying there again.

<Content>Exceeded Our Expectations Jan 14 - 17,2008Our standard room with two beds was spacious with high ceilings and two windows with a great view looking out over St Charles trolley with city and lighted bridge in background. There was a comfortable lounge chair, good lighting and roomy desk with an adjustable chair - perfect for my laptop and their free wireless internet. Also an hour of free long distance every night. The free hot breakfast, my husband thought one of the best breakfasts ever. Delicious scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, biscuits and gravy, rolls, even raisin bread toast along with bagels, cereal, fruit, yogurt, coffee, tea, cocoa and fruit drinks. Oh yes, there were free snacks and drinks from 5:30PM to 7 PM as well. Our room was spotlessly clean and- though we were right near the elevator -very quiet. Every staff person we met was courteous and helpful. We loved the location - on the edge of the french quarter. We'd have a big breakfast; plan to skip lunch; and spend the better part of the day wandering through the french quarter, then have an early dinner - no trouble with reservations.Area is well-lighted, trolley also stops right in front, but we felt safe walking. Best dinner was a couple blocks away at Herbsaint, which we also got from TripAdvisor, maybe #4 on popularity index. Wonderful neighborhood bistro with great food and super service. This was our first time back since Katrina and we are eager to return. We'll definitely stay at Drury Inn.

<Content>Stunned by this gem Having never stayed at a Drury property, I expected the usual chain hotel scene. I was truly overwhelmed by all the extras at Drury. I booked a standard double room at a low rate ($71) and requested a quiet location, usually ignored by most receptionists. At Drury I was given exactly what I requested, and more. The room was spacious, immaculate, quiet, comfortable (mattress and pillows were amazing). There is a free computer in the lobby to check email, etc. The free hot breakfast was more than ample and the Hispanic dining attendant was the most cheerful, pleasant person - keeping the room moving and refilling orange juice cups whenever she had a spare moment. The evening cocktail hour (and a half) was very pleasant with free drinks, chips, cheese  salsa and fresh popcorn. What floored me most was the obvious exceptional management: as I was waiting to check in for all of thirty seconds, a young man rushed across the lobby to ask if he could help in any way. When I mentioned that I was just checking in, he stated that he was a maintainance person but would immediately find the receptionist. That's a dedicated employee with a great work ethic, and also a statement about management. The Drury was exceptional across the board. Location is perfect for walks into the French Quarter, trolley to the Garden District, and safe walk back at night. I will go out of my way to book Drury property on subsequent trips, especially the Drury New Orleans.

<Content>Great Hotel for the price The hotel is in a convenient downtown location. It is a few blocks to the French Quarter, but is within walking distance. The streetcar picks up right outside the hotel so this is another option for getting the Quarter.The hotel was clean and the room was comfortable. The front desk personnel were helpful. The morning breakfast was pretty good also, however, there is just so much good food in New Orleans that it is hard to pass up any opportunity to eat at a local restaurant.This hotel was priced below the rates of others in the area and is a good deal. They also have convenient, reasonably priced parking. I would definitely stay here again. I have absolutely no complaints about this hotel.

<Content>Very Good Value and Location We were very pleasantly surprised when we stayed here for 2 nights prior to sailing on the Carnival Fantasy. We booked 2 rooms at around $65/night each, which included a nightly happy hour and an above-average breakfast buffet (with decent scrambled eggs, waffle machine, etc).This is an older property which has been renovated very nicely. The rooms are small but functional. Everything was quite clean and staff was courteous and efficient (except for recommending dinner at Mulate's - see separate review).We were less than a 10-minute walk from the Vieux Carre, which we walked to and from several times, never feeling unsafe or nervous for a single moment.To be so close to downtown, yet in a safe location, and get decent accommodations for a modest price in a very expensive city, the Drury is an outstanding value. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Deal, Clean, Comfortable We were in New Orleans for a Saints game and wanted a reasonably priced yet nice, clean, and comfortable place to stay within walking distance of the Super Dome and French Quarter. The Drury was exactly what we were looking for. The complementary hot breakfast before the game was good and saved us the hassle of finding food on a crowed game morning. Parking was $15 per day which is low for New Orleans, and the parking lot was easy to get into and out of. Our room was comfortable and clean. It was small and did not have much of a view, but we were not in New Orleans to hang out in the room and look out of the window. The room did have a refrigerator which was nice for keeping our drinks cold. The lobby is beautiful, check in was fast and easy, and the staff was great. They did not charge us the cancellation fee for our second night when we had to leave a day early even though we used the esaver rate which is supposed to have a $25 cancellation fee. The walk to the French Quarter was short and well lit at night.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in NO This hotel was a pleasant surprise in New Orleans. I'd never stayed in a Drury hotel, and now I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. The lobby was lovely, there was a full hot breakfast, sodas available during the day, staff was friendly, beds were comfortable and room was clean with marble tiles in entrance and bathroom. Most importantly, all Drury hotels are pet friendly, and my dog had a great time looking out our 8th floor window at the streets of New Orleans. It was a short walk to the french quarter, and the streetcar lines are right outside the door.

<Content>Great Value in NOLA Our family stayed here from November 2 to Nov. 4th when we were visiting for a family function. We reserved one suite and one double room. Both were excellent, very comfortable and clean and nicely decorated. Rooms had microwaves, refigerators, coffee makers, and very comfy beds. Also a free hot breakfast each morning, as well as free drinks at happy hour, and snacks and soft drinks in the lobby all day. We were able to walk to Bourbon Street, Riverwalk, and Harrah's Casino. But best of all was a nightly rate WELL under the other hotels. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Drury is greatv New Orleans is fabulous We live in north Lousiana and have stayed at this hotel many times, both pre-and post-Katrina. The rooms are consistently clean and well appointed. The location is excellent (a few blocks from the Superdome) and cabs are readily available. The hot breakfast is excellent. Service is typical New Orleans: friendly but slow. Relax, have a drink, you're in the Big Easy.Note to tourists: New Orleans is perfectly safe. If you're not buying or selling drugs, you are unlikely to get in the way of violence. The tourist areas are very safe. We go often and have never felt threatened. My son lives uptown and never has any problems. Go, spend money, help the city. It's a fun, fun place.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at the hotel during a conference. The Drury was not one of the conference hotels, but it was $100 per night cheaper. I got a suite for $90.00. The hotel was 1/2 block from the conference shuttle stop. Very clean, spacious and nice hotel. The breakfast is convenient (if you want Denny's go there. This isn't Denny's) and a great extra. Staff was pleasant. A short walk to the FQ. Absoultely would stay here again.

<Content>Great bargain My wife and I went for a 3-day weekend on Thursday evening 7/26/2007 to see our daughter during her summer internship in NOLA with Shell Oil. We booked through Travelocity unsing direct NWA flights from DTW to MSY. The upcharge from just the flight cost was amazingly small for both of us. The hotel was easy to find and had on-site parking. Upon arriving I asked if we could have our daughter stay with us instead of travelling back and forth to her apartment in Kenner. I said I would pay extra if necessary. The very nice young desk lady changed our room from a king to two doubles which was fine for us at no charge. Included in the accomodations was a small hot breakfast buffet and free well cocktails each evening (3 per adult). The bar used a bulk liquor dispenser nozzle. There was also a Soda Fountain machine available in the lobby 24/7. We had cocktails once but ate breakfast every morning of our stay. The food was good and hot, perhaps the scrambled eggs a little salty, but I have had much worse. Twin make your own waffles etc.The public areas were very clean and neat. A lot of impressive marble and over in the corner was a gratis computer and printer for quick email or flight updates and boarding passes.The room was clean and neat. There was enough room for the three of us with the two doubles. All the service staff we met were freindly although some had limited english (Latina). The location was near enough to the FQ for us to walk it 4-5 blocks directly to west end of Bourbon St.). The Casino which we didn't go to was about twice that straight down the main street.The big bonus was when we checked out they didn't charge is for parking as we expected so all in all we got a great bargain and were very pleased.

<Content>Great Value! Great hotel. We traveled with our two kids, age 7 and 10. Outdoor pool on rooftop was nice. Best part is the parking. We have stayed at many French Quarter hotels and you have to wait forever for the valet to get your car. You parked your own car at Drury. Excellent! I also liked the fact that you had to use your room key to activate the elevators as well as the outdoor /stairwell entrances. Rooms (we had the suite) are very spacious and the breakfast and evening cocktails/snacks and cokes and popcorn(free) are great. Staff was very accomodating. We will stay there on our next trip to New Orleans.

<Content>Great Pet Friendly Hotel This hotel is underestimated. It was a pleasant surprise. Location was central to Bourbon St., Superdome, Riverwalk. They were pet friendly and did not have any 'strict' rules for the pets except it should be under 25lbs (but i even saw a large dog on the premises too). No extra fee for pet. The free extras are: internet access in room (no charge), also internet in lobby, free HOT breakfast (sausage, eggs, orange juice, muffins, waffles, fruit....) Free soft drinks and coffee all day. Evening Happy Hour which include snacks and drinks. The lobby is CLEAN. I even saw the morning kitchen crew wiping down all the underside of the tables, window seals etc. I just can't say enough about this place except my stay was very pleasant and I will be back. Staff was also wonderful. And all this 'hospitality' was during the Essence Festival which is when you expect service to drop...but not at this hotel. They are the best!

<Content>Loved the "free" Happy hour First of all, if you're considering staying at this hotel I recomend trying to book it through the Drury website with the e-saver rate. This was my first time to new Orleans and it was a blast! Driving from the I-10 was easy to find the hotel as its towards the superdome. I was a bit weary of staying so close to the french quarter but the hotel is VERY secure (gated parking lot, electronic key access to hotel and elevator, etc). I felt vey safe at this hotel. The front desk staff were extremely friendly especially jamie calling everyone sweetie and hunni. We left our passports at the front desk security box free of charge (we were the only ones with a key to it). The free happy hour was great they had everything from wine to cocktails. I do not recomend the beer as it was very flat. We were also upgraded to a suite once they found out we were newly weds. Had an amazing view and a very clean hotel room. Me and my husband are clean freaks and let me just say this is one of the cleanest hotels we have ever been to. Bed was comfy. Breakfast was good. Had a good variety. No complaints from this group. If we are to stay in New orleans again we will definitley be staying at the Drury Inn.

<Content>Just okay The hotel was average at best. In the business district which is not a location I recommend. We had to stay there because of a conference and it was more convenient. The lobby of this hotel is beautiful, but it ends there. The room was average. The problem I had was the fact that we had a sliver for a window and it was facing a large building. It was very dark and I did not feel like I was in New Orleans at all. I could have been in Atlanta, anywhere really. The bed was uncomfortable and we even found a drop of blood on the pillow. Ewww. We didn't say anything, just put it aside. The rooftop pool is pretty cool and the breakfast in the morning is a nice touch. I would not recommend this hotel to business travelers and would suggest staying in the Warehouse district and walk. We stayed in New Orleans for 4 days - 2 days here and 2 days at the Country Inn and Suites which we absolutely loved. Dark room, poor customer service, overcharged at checkout, blood on the pillow make me not want to stay here again.

<Content>Fine...but Generic The room was clean, the employees were courteous, the self-parking was free, and the buffet breakfast was fine, but we really could have been Anywhere, USA -- which was not why we went to New Orleans. The immediate neighborhood is mostly office buildings, and I would not have felt comfortable walking into the French Quarter (especially at night). We moved to a hotel in the FQ (away from Bourbon Street) and were much happier.

After a full day of meetings it felt great to relax in the beautiful rooms and comfortable beds. The morning breakfast buffet saved us much time.

<Content>Fantasitic service, location, breakfast I recently booked about 25 rooms for a wedding. All of our family and friends loved the hotel and thought it was a great bargain for a downtown hotel.FIRST LET ME SAY - THE STAFF WAS THE BEST! Extremely pleasant and helpful, especially at the front desk!!The lobby is spacious and beautiful with enough room for several groups to sit and visit. The included breakfast was very good with many choices of hot and cold foods. The free drinks in the early evening are great too!We had Kings, doubles and mini-suites in our block of rooms. All rooms had fridges and microwaves. The mini-suite was larger than I expected - full living room and separate bedroom. Lighting in the rooms was a bit dark as it relied on 3 lamps in the living area. Our rooms were clean and well maintained, especially for this city!Location is great - just 4 blocks from the French Quarter. Close enough to party, but separate for those who want to be able to get away from Bourbon St. It is on the streetcar line, but unfortunately it is not running as frequently as pre-K and not yet going Uptown.The building is secured, requiring key cards to enter after dark, to use the elevator and parking. Our biggest complaint was that the key cards sometimes didn't work in the elevator or parking, so we had to get them reprogrammed frequently. Parking was secure, but $15/day.

Our room had a horrible stale, almost medecinal smell and the spa tub had a fistful of hairs as well as a mysterious moldy film in it. The free drinks were okay, the snack were just that snacks - tortilla chips, potato chips and chex mix. The breakfast was not the lavish feast folks had raved about - just very rin of the mill, muffins, biscuits and make your own waffles. We expected more and have gotten much more at the same price point at other hotels inthe area - International House, Homewood Suites, the Courtyard and the W...

<Content>Loved New Orleans! We stayed here in October 2006 for 5 nights. We had a pretty good stay. We actually spent very little time in the hotel. We did enjoy the early evening snacks and drinks. Once. The morning breakfast was very nice. It included eggs, bacon, cereals, bagels, and much more. You must use your room key in the elevators to get to your room. The rooms was nice and large. Our only problem was a missing remote control that took 2 days to get replaced. The pool on the roof was very exciting for my teenage daughter. She loved it. Everyone was very friendly. I don't know if we would stay here again simply because there are so many great places to stay in New Orleans and we would love to try them all!

<Content>Excellent Hotel I was very nervous about staying in a hotel in New Orleans after reading some horror stories on Trip Advisor. This hotel was recommended though, so I booked here and found it to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.Wow. It is flash. Despite being only a little after 12 p.m. we were welcomed and given a room key. The room was amazing. It had a small beer fridge with soda (carbonated drinks) and pop corn, even a microwave. There was a data port connection which I could plug my laptop into and access the internet.Free cocktails in the early evening, a really good breakfast included in the room price, and a pool on top of the hotel to relax at the end of the day means that I will stay here every time I visit New Orleans.Just a note on scams in New Orleans. On our way back to the hotel our first night, we were approached by a guy who said 鈥淚 bet you $5 I can tell you where you got them shoes鈥?Fortunately I had been warned about this scam in a guide book, and I shot right back 鈥淚 got them on this street man.鈥?He chuckled and told us another. 鈥淲hat is the last thing you take off at night before you go to bed?鈥? the answer is 鈥淵our feet off the floor鈥? Be ready for this as there were several people attempting this.He then proceeded to tell us that he was the best shoe-shiner in New Orleans and to prove it started spraying shoe polish on my boots telling me that I could have a cheap shoe shine, only $5. I didn鈥檛 wait to find out if this would later be clarified as $5 per boot, but took off. It is extraordinarily difficult to shine someone鈥檚 shoes who is walking away at top speed, and he eventually gave up on following us and went looking for some other victim.

<Content>Best Kept Secret Of New Orleans Though it's been a couple of months since I stayed at the Drury Inn, I thought I would give my two cents worth.Yes, the Drury Inn in New Orleans is one of the best kept secrets. As a travel agent I was in New Orleans for a whirl wind tour, different hotel evey night. The Drury Inn was my last stop and proved to be the best stop.From the moment you step into their magnificent lobby and then to receive a very warm welcome by the desk staff, you know right then this is going to be a much different hotel experience. The grandeur of the lobby is not the only place where you'll find it. It's also in the guest bathrooms and the touches found in the rooms.The free morning breakfast is far more than just coffee, juice and Danish. Having one of their hearty breakfasts will last you past lunchtime.The pool on the roof with it's panoramic views is something to enjoy any time of the day.Whether you stay for a day, a week or month, put this one high on your list of places to stay in New Orleans

It is easily accessible from the freeway. We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Just Okay Staying in hotels in New Orleans right now you can't expect much service due to high shortages in employees and this hotel is not an exception. I hardly ever saw the hotel staff. The furnishings in my opinion were dark and 80ish looking. Because of the dark carpet and furniture it didn't feel very clean. The bathroom was small and just average. There was a small fridge and microwave. Internet access was free so that was nice. And they had free snacks/drinks in the evening which were good. I felt very safe; you needed your room key to use the elevator. It is only about 4 blocks from Bourbon Street and about 3 to Harrah's and the Riverwalk. It is easy to get your car from parking. They have a small gated lot next to the hotel and you can just walk and get your car anytime without having to get a valet. Overall it was an okay place to sleep, because you didn't want to spend time there. Which is good if you going to New Olreans 'cause who wants to stay in the room anyway.

<Content>Great find in New Orleans I am a travel agent and thus stay in many hotels each year. This one is a winner in its category and price range. The staff is friendly and helpful. We had a corner room that had a living room, dressing area, bath and bedroom, with plenty of windows all around. The perks that Drury offers add to the value. The free breakfast is bountiful and far superior to most offered free at hotels. The free afternoon snacks and drinks are a fun way to wind down before going out on the town at night. The adjacent parking is also free, and that is a serious cost savings in a large city. We didn't find the walk to the French Quarter to be too long, and it is very direct - right down the hotel's street is Bourbon Street. Besides, the hotel is nicely located for both the French Quarter and the action along the Riverwalk. If I were writing directly to the management, I would make a couple of suggestions for improvement. The available guest laundry is a great idea but offers just one machine for the whole hotel. We had to keep running back and forth from our room to try and find the machine available for use. And, it was hard for us to find someplace to sit to eat breakfast because groups of people just sat around at the tables (there aren't that many of them) chatting and reading after finishing. This is more rude on the guest's part than it is the fault of Drury. However, there must be some way to politely suggest that people vacate the tables when finished.All-in-all, a successful hotel with useful and friendly perks. If you remember the low price for your room, the value becomes even more apparent.

<Content>Drury Inn  We stayed at the Drury from June 6 - 10, there were 3 of us in a 1 bedroom king suite with sofabed. There was lots of room for us to spread out  relax after a hot day of touring, with the 2 tv's we didn't fight over what to watch late at night.The hotel was clean, sheets  towels were stainless  beds were comfortable, even the sofa.Breakfast in morning was a good start to the day  happy hour had some strong drinks to start off your evening.Although the staff were not particularly helpful in questions I asked (where certain restaurants were) they were friendly  helped when they could.It is quick walk to Bourbon  the Riverwalk, the streetcars are nearby  cheap taxi rides from the Quarter.Great hotel if looking for something outside of the Quarter.

<Content>Very nice hotel with perks! This hotel is on the same street that turns into to Bourbon Street (only a few blocks away) so we really liked the location. The free breakfast was really good, the free happy hour was nice and the free popcorn and soft drinks was loved by our teenagers. The roof top pool was really neat being on the 10th floor. The room was nice and clean. I'd highly reccommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great value! Just got back from 6 nights at the Drury. Can't say enough good things about it. The free breakfast is average, but hey, it's free! The happy hour is a good perk. I don't recommend the margaritas, but everything else was excellent. It was nice to come back and enjoy the happy hour before going out for dinner.We had a king-sized single room. It was very clean. We had no malfunctions at all. My husband hates hotels and even he was happy! The staff is very nice and will help with anything. The rest of our experience in NO was not so great (stolen wallet, sinus infection), but we were very happy with the hotel.

<Content>Great bargain, great hotel, not for everyone The Drury is admittedly a great bargain. In addition to the low cost, there is free breakfast and snacks and drinks in the afternoon, and there is a free parking lot adjacent to the hotel. The hotel and rooms are clean and attractive, and the staff was friendly and helpful.The catch is, it is a bit of a walk from the French Quarter. We live in New York and are accostomed to walking everywhere, so we thought we would not mind. Late at night, however, the business district is deserted, so we opted to take cabs. The cost of the cabs was not an issue, given the money we saved by staying here, but we wished we had stayed in a hotel closer to the Quarter so we could stop by quickly in the afternoon or change between touring the historical sites during the day and going out at night. We never wanted to walk all the way to the business district and back. Also, we never got up in time for the breakfast and were not around to enjoy the free afternoon cocktails.If you do not mind the inconvenience of being a walk from the Quarter, or if you plan to spend most of your time at Harrah's, then the Drury is the best bargain in town.

<Content>Great Value Stayed one night on May 14, 2005 for our 12th Wedding Anniversary. We were very pleased with the Value of the Hotel. We usually stay at the Astor which is also great, however, you get a lot of extras at the Drury. The breakfast was wonderful. The room was very clean, not fancy, but clean. We come to New Orleans several times a year and will definately come back to the Drury. The parking is also a great deal. Anywhere else in New Orleans is at least $25-$30 (plus you have to tip the valet) and you do not have access to your car once you turn it over to the Hotels. The Drury has a lot directly next to the hotel and you can come and go as you please. I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a nice clean place to stay without spending a fortune. With the money you save, you can treat yourself to a few extras on vacation.

<Content>nice place I had never stayed at a Drury Inn. I was pleasantly surprised. Room was very clean. Nice touches with the free long distance calls, pop and popcorn. Even free drinks in the lobby at night (like you need more alcohol here...). I did not like the $13 for parking, but what can you say it is a city. Had a pretty room woman check me in, but the guys I spoke with later in the day were very helpful. Would definitely recommend to others.

<Content>Best deal in town Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Drury and could not have been more pleased. First of all, the accomodations for just a single room surpass some suites we have stayed in in NOLA; 15 ft ceilings, floor to ceiling windows with a great view,extremely comfortable bed, large area with more than enough room to move around and marble bathrooms were a very nice touch. The evening reception was fantastic. (Allejandro, good job with those Rum and Cokes). The front office staff were the friendliest we have encountered yet in N'awlins. We travel to New Orleans quite often and we have now found our new preferred place to stay in the Big Easy.

<Content>Loved the Drury We stayed at the Drury from April 8-11 and had a great time. Dennis at the front desk was super helpful and Alejandro at the bar was great. The Drury is within a few minutes of walking to the French Quarter or the Riverfront. We walked everywhere and never had a problem. The breakfast buffet included in the room price is quite good. You can even make yourself some Belgian waffles - they provide all the fixins. Just make sure you go early before everything is gone - they're not too quick on replenishing the food. The evening happy hour is wonderful. Each person gets 3 free drinks and they aren't stingy. There are some munchies served as well. Overall, it's quite relaxing. Considering what we paid, I think we got good value for our money. We went during the French Quarter Festival, so the prices were higher than other times, but still much less than the other hotels we were considering.

<Content>Fantastic!! April 9th 1:00pm: We arrived disheveled and cranky right after getting off our cruise ship.We were greeted by the nicest desk clerk who was welcoming and warm. I wish everyone we had met in New Orleans was as friendly!We asked for a recomedation for a restaurant and she promptly pointed us in the direction of Mother's, which had wonderful food.Our room was incredible! High ceilings, luxury fabrics, marble flooring, a view of the city, microwave and fridge. The room was spotless and the free popcorn/sodas were a great touch. The beds/pillows were soft and comfy, which is rare in a hotel. We were able to call our family for 1 hour (free of charge) the minute we checked in. In the morning, we enjoyed the best biscuits and gravy we'd had in a long while. Checkout was easy. We felt like we were leaving friends. We'll definitely be using this hotel again--and telling everyone we know. Thanks for a great stay Drury Inn! The Knights

<Content>Great Stay at the Drury and New Orleans Recommendations Just returned from 3 nights at the Drury New Orleans. Excellent location, walk about 4 blocks to Canal, cross over and you're right on Bourbon Street. Great hot breakfast buffet ( the fresh made Belgian waffles were the best), but same thing every morning, so don't expect a great variety. 3 free drinks and munchies, Monday - Thursday. Rooms were spacious, clean, get the 2 room suite if you are able, better than the single room accommodation. Husband could sleep while I watched the 2nd TV in the living room. Only thing I didn't like was room faced the building next door and was a little dark. If you want a view and more light spring for the city view rooms. Very nicely furnished lobby. Staff was friendly and helpful with tourist questions. Hotel is right on the trolley line to the Garden District. Get on right on Poydras toward Canal and stay on it when it swings aroung and goes up St. Charles Ave. Better way to get a seat when it's crowded. THis location was walkable to everywhere including the Riverfront. Ate at Commander's Palace for lunch, they have regular sized 25 cent Martinis at lunch. Also ate a NOLA's, very, very good but like most of New Orleans' better restaurants, it was pricey but worth it for the food and the excellent service. Best oysters were at the Acme Seafood House off Bourbon.

The rooms are AWESOME. The ceilings are high, the rooms are clean and greater large windows. The service is amazing and they have free drinks, nachos and snacks in the evening. I will most definitely recommend this. Good job guys.

<Content>The best deal in town Stayed at the Drury last week and can confirm that the reviews on here are still valid: this has to be one of the best deals in a town where the hotels enjoy an occupancy level that seems to have made many of them a bit arrogant.Location is really convenient for both French Quarter and CBD, and the St Charles streetcar stops just a block away.Checked in early without problems, and found the room to be spacious, clean and to expectations. High-speed internet in the room and an hour's long distance calling is free, which can be a huge hassle-saver (look up restaurants and attractions etc.) Even a couple of complimentary drinks in the fridge and popcorn in the microwave, ready to go.The breakfast was good, though admittedly not fantastic, but chances are you will be stuffing yourself with fantastic food during your stay in this city anyway, so no need to go overboard at breakfast time.Same thing goes for the rooftop pool - more of a bathtub, really, but hey, this is just too good a place to sit around a pool.Staff was friendly and helpful thorughout.I had the dubious pleasure of staying at three different hotels during my visit(!), this one was hands down the best one.

<Content>Excellent! Very pleased! I stayed at the Drury during a conference in July 2004. I was very surprised and pleased at the condition of the hotel. Nicely kept/decorated lobby, and my room was fabulous. I had a room on the end of the hotel and I had tall windows on 2 sides of the room which allowed for a terrific view of the city. Marble bathrooms were very nice and I just overall enjoyed my stay thoroughly. Plus this was the cheapest hotel on the travel list so I really felt like I got a good deal! I would definitely stay there again on my next trip.

<Content>Loved We had a great time at the Drury Inn. We stayed there the night before our cruise February 13. The staff was friendly and helpful. The deluxe breakfast buffet was awesome - best we'd ever had. The drinks and snacks in the evening was a nice touch. We were 2000 miles from home and we ran into a friend at the hotel. The rooms were large and nicely redecorated. It was about 3 blocks from the French Quarter. But be careful...the street the hotel is on becomes Bourbon street! We ended up there by accident on a Saturday evening with grandparents and two kids! We all had a good laugh and got to the next street quickly.All in all...highly recommended and a good price.

<Content>Loved it! We just returned from 2 nights at the Drury in New Orleans. The location was great, definitely not on the french quarter, but close enough to count. We liked the secured parking and the ability to come and go at any time. We were in a King suite with two children (age 3 and 8 ) and never felt crowded. The high ceilings give a feel of spaciousness I have not experienced in other hotels. The kids swam in the rooftop pool. We chose to check out New Orleans with our car, but the location was good enough for energetic people ( and those without small children) to easily walk down to the main part of Riverwalk mall, the aquarium and Harrahs. We did not use the cable system, once again because of small children, but it was very accessible. The morning breakfast was EXCELLENT. Hot and cold foods. The evening snack time with drinks was WONDERFUL. We had been heading out to find dinner on our second night and almost got too full on nachos and drinks at the snack time (beer for my husband, margarita for me and the kids had pepsi). The ambience is plush and old world looking, but nice. We will definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone looking for a good price, good location.

We had an excellent vacation  the Drury was just a wonderful place to stay.It has an excellent location, the staff was very nice  friendly,  the room had everything that we needed, including a fridge  microwave. The free soft drinks  popcorn were a nice surprise! They even allowed us to check in 3-4 hrs early. I'm sure we'll stay here again. We usually go to New Orleans a couple times a year  will be sure to check the Drury Inn out the next time we vacation there.

The extras (popcorn  soda, happy hour tickets and the breakfast) are what make this hotel a step above what we normally stay at.The location is very good, only a five minute walk to Bourbon Street. The Charles Streetcar is just across the street. Our favorite New Orleans restaurant, Mother's, is just a few blocks down Poydras.

<Content>Wow! What a great find! This truly was a great find. The hotel is in a great location, close enough to walk to the French Quarter and a block away from the St Charles Streetcar to go to the garden district. Parking, while not free, was convenient. The accomodations were well on their way to being luxurious. Probably half a notch down from the Hilton, certainly many notches about a standard Holiday Inn or the such. Spacious, clean rooms with an easy-chair and writing desk, not to mention the small fridge and microwave made the rooms comfortable and pleasant. The air conditioning was central air, not one of those big boxes stuck in the window, which makes it so much quieter! The best free breakfast I have ever had at a hotel, including eggs, french toast and do-it-yourself-waffle iron. The breakfast ran until 9:30 am, AND there was still plenty left at 9:30 am! Plus, and of course this is a big plus, FREE drinks in the evening! And (there are so many ands to this hotel it's amazing!) the pool and hot-tub on the roof offered a wonderful city view. All in all this hotel was possibly the greatest deal I have ever found online, offering moderately priced, clean, safe, and pleasant accomodations. Not only would I return to this Drury Inn, but I would also seek out another in a different city.

<Content>Loved the Fleas I visit New Orleans at least 3 times a year for the past 5 years. The last 3 years we have stayed at the Drury Inn. The family decided to spend Christmas and New Years in New Orleans and booked our stay at this hotel. We booked 2 rooms that were on the 9th floor. Rooms 907 and 909. These rooms were infested with Fleas. We asked for different rooms and at first they wouldn't give it to us, but eventually they did. The next set of rooms 917 and 919 also had Fleas but this time both rooms had broken toilets. Every time you would flush they would run for over an hour. In room 919 there was a molded rag laying there and it had been there awhile because it literally had mold on it. So we arrived on 12-24-04 and left 1-1-05. Nothing like 8 days of Fleas. They had to close the pool because they allowed Dogs in the pool. I will say the breakfast and the happy hour drinks were the best thing of this particular trip. We did love staying at this hotel, but we will not be back.

<Content>Excellent Value Stayed 3 nights before and after a cruise in Jan/05. I chose the hotel based on the reviews here and the great price we got on the hotel website ($74.99 for a king size bed) and we were not disappointed. Hotel has a great lobby, very good location allowing you to walk all around the French Quarter. The room was clean and spacious and the front desk staff were wonderful esp. Dennis and Rosey. I would have given the hotel 5* but because we had problems with the toilet clogging up in 2 different rooms. However, the staff acted immediately after we complained and sent maintenance right away. Also, water pressure in the shower could be stronger. The room has a coffee maker, hair dryer and iron. Breakfast was free, what more could you ask for the money we paid? I loved the waffles and the biscuits with the delicious sauce. I believe this hotel should be rated ***, not **.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Good hotel all around I stayed here for a week right after the Sugar Bowl. I actually stayed at a Spring Hill Marriott on St. Joesph's and S. Peter's the two previous days for the game, but I booked this hotel for an extended vacation and getaway with a close friend.I booked a room with a kingsize bed and a one person whirlpool tub, and thought the rate was quite reasonable for the time period I would be there (five nights including a weekend). I even made a special request online for a room with a view, in one of the upper stories, and on a corner.I arrived early and my exact room wasn't available, but I was offered another with all the same except for the tub - I just checked my bags (free), left my cell phone #, and wandered the French Quarter until the room was ready in about an hour (I actually wandered for about 3 hours, just because).The hotel is located on Carondelet which turns into Bourbon as you cross over Canal. It's a quick walk (5 minutes) to Canal and the French Quarter. And from there you can walk anywhere. I felt safe the whole time, whether I was out in the day or walking back at night, but you always want to keep your wits about you in the city. The street car runs this way but I never used it. I did take a cab twice back to the hotel, once from Harrah's ($6 bucks with tip) and then once from a restaurant on the northern part of Decaturer ($11, for two folks, with tip).The breakfast in the morning was all right. I wasn't too impressed with the fake eggs, but the remainder of the continental breakfast was an adequate start to what always turned into lunch and dinner feasts in the Quarter. The staff was helpful for whatever you asked for. Parking in their lot was perfect. We took the car down to the shopping district along Magazine and walked down there for an afternoon.The bed was fine, there was a recliner, dresser, desk and TV cabinet in the room. Nothing was particularly special or lush, but everything was clean, worked fine and was comfortable.It was a good place to start out from and come back to everyday particularly for that price (oh, I paid either $100 or $109 a night). I felt extremely satisfied with my experience. If you can find a place that has a better location, gives you a kingsize bed an whirlpool tub for a better rate, oh and let's you park (cheaply I'll add) in a gated parking lot right outside the doors - have at it.I would only try another hotel in the area if I was going for something really high end or directly inside the French Quarter.

<Content>great location We just stayed at Drury inn for the Sugar Bowl. We arrived several hours before check in time but our room was ready for us anyway. We parked at the hotel (secure parking)and walked everywhere we wanted to go. Its only a short walk(10 minutes) from the superdome, Harrahs casino,riverwalk and the french quarter. The cable car is close but we didnt use it. We found the hotel very clean and up to date.The staff was very friendly and the hotel breakfast was good. But if you prefer, Mothers resturant is only 2 blocks away for a great breakfast. Id suggest looking at the prices of other hotels and then save yourself some money and stay here. The standard rooms are a little small but clean. But for less then the price for many other hotel standard rooms you can get a suite and they are nice size. Homewood suites and La pavilloion are right across the street and they are both very nice also. But for the money id stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel right next to the Quarter I stayed at this hotel on December 26th 2004 and have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. The hotel was very clean and the rooms nice and good size. The two interactions I had with the hotel staff could not have been any better. The hotel is on Poydras and Carondalet (Carondalet turns into Bourbon St.) and is only four blocks from the Quarter (Canal and Bourbon). We walked from the hotel to the French Quarter day and night and found this hotel to be the perfect location (that is unless you are looking to stay in the Quarter on Bourbon...which we weren't). It's a five minute walk from the hotel front door to Canal and Bourbon streets and the walk is well lit and fine for walking. The hotel also offers offstreet parking and it costs and additional $13.

<Content>A diamond in the rough My wife and I along with my parents stayed at the Drury and were shocked with this hotel. The lobby, rooms, public areas were all gorgeous. Clean, elegant, warm, fun are just a few words to describe the hotel. Staff was friendly and really tried hard to make sure things were pleasant for guests. Free happy hour drinks and snacks was a great time. The free hot breakfast was delicious and saved money. Had a great time on Halloween night and easily walked to Bourbon St. and other French Quarter attractions. The price at the Drury was out of the world compared to some of the overpriced, overused hotels in the French Quarter. I wish all hotels were like the Drury!

<Content>Very satisfied I stayed at the Drury last August for a conference as I could not afford the official conference hotels (Fairmont, Sheraton, etc.). I could not have been more pleased - the room was clean and comfortable, free pop and microwave popcorn were provided in the room, and the breakfasts were substantial. Elegant lobby and staircase. The rooftop pool was not large, but it was wonderfully refreshing up there with the breeze after trudging around in 40 degree C temperatures all day. The location was also convenient - easy walk to the French Quarter, the other major hotels and to the streetcar lines. Fantastic value for money - I was suprised at just how nice it was.

<Content>clean and well kept I was traveling cross country,and I had stayed at crappy Motel 6s, so this, for the same price, was a relief. It was clean and pleasant. The free cocktails and hors d'eurves and the breakfast were okay, but not anything to brag about. What mattered to me was a parking lot (I had all my worldly possessions in my car so the cute little French Quarter hotels were out of the question). This hotel had one right out front so I could see and get to my car easily. If you want to be waited on hand and foot you'll have to pay more than this hotel, but if all you want is clean, comfortable, and quiet, but near enough to the French Quarter to walk there then I would definitely recommend this place.

<Content>Drury Inn is the Best!! I had a conference in New Orleans and could not afford to stay at the pricey Fairmont Hotel. After researching on the Web and reading rave reviews, I decided to give the Drury Inn and Suites a try. Wow, what a nice place. My only complaint is that they do not have a restaraunt on the property, but they do serve heavy snacks at night and an awesome breakfast. I had a 2 room suite, complete with a living area, with a desk to work at, huge bedroom area and an excellent bathroom (all marble). I felt very safe as the elevators and stairwells were card access only. The pool on the roof (heated) was beautiful. The excerise room was sparse, but for what I paid, best bargain for my money in a long time!! Defintley recommend and the staff were so nice and friendly. Very close to the trolley, stops at the corner and nice walking distance to the casino and riverwalk mall area.

<Content>Would stay again This hotel, especially considering its comparatively reasonable room rates, has a lot to offer. On our first night of a 3 night stay in Oct., 2004, we were given one of several rooms on the first floor off of the lobby. The room had 12 foot ceilings and lots of space but early morning laundry noise caused us to ask for another room. Our request was cheerfully honored and the second room, like the first, was comfortable and clean with both a microwave and refridgerator. The easy in-and-out parking lot is fenced and adjacent to the hotel as is the Charles street streetcar line. The free breakfast was ok as was the first night free social. The hotel is short walk to the French quarter, the river, and the convention center. However I would use caution walking around the hotel neighborhood, as well as most of the rest of New Orleans, after dark. As to restaurants, there are plenty in the French quarter but not in the vicinity of the hotel.

<Content>Hotel and Staff were great My family and I stayed here the night before our cruise 09/29/04. The hotel is clean and in a great location. Easy access to the street car and Bourbon street is only a few blocks away.The staff was very friendly, especially Palistine (sp). I asked if we could keep our luggage there while we walked around the next day and she took very good care of it. She even called a cab (minivan) for us to take us to the pier.I highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again.

<Content>Great place to stay in New Orleans We stayed at the Poydras Drury Inn in late July of 2004. It was a terrific place to stay. Affordable, walking distance to the French Quarter, and very elegant for the price. We stayed at a similar Drury in St. Louis (Union Station) earlier that summer--just as satisfied. I think it is great to put updated motels in older buildings, near the downtown instead of out by an airport. This building has character, but is as clean and comfortable as a new motel. It is located in a quiet area, but pretty close to some major roads. We had a bit of problem finding it, even with Mapquest directions. It was sure worth it, though.Parking was extra, but convenient. We walked to the French Quarter, the new shopping center by the river, and the wonderful D-Day museum with no problem. The walk to the French Quarter was a bit farther than websites indicate, but much better than driving and trying to find a parking place. The breakfast was fine (but the usual motel quality, lots of mediocre but edible food) except a big tour bus was leaving and we had to wait in line quite a while. The rooftop pool was small and crowded when we were there, but not awful. The popcorn and soda provided in the inroom fridge (and a microwave) was a nice touch. We only spent a day and a half in New Orleans. I hope to go back, and will stay at this motel again!

<Content>Very Good Value Ive stayed in several worse hotels in New Orleans that were more expensive than the Drury. They have great service (they even let me check in early), great location (4-5 blocks from the Quarter), great parking ($13/night w/unlimited access), great security (you cant even use the elevator without a room key), and great breakfast (lots of choices). And the every part of the hotel is very clean, unlike a lot of other hotels in NO. AND it cost at least $20 cheaper/night than any other hotel I saw in the area. I will stay here everytime I visit from now on.

<Content>Very Pleasant experience! Recently spent three nights. Booked after reviewing tripadvisor reviews. CLEAN and wonderfully situated. Self parking was attached to the hotel, secure and, relative to nearby hotels, inexpensive. Staff was not overly attentive but we preferred it that way. The breakfast buffet was nice although nothing exceptional. The free cocktails in the afternoon were a pleasant surprise and much appreciated. The roof top pool was a bit difficult to get to but once there clean, quiet and refreshing (bring your own towl). Lots of room in the suite. Free soda every day placed in the refrigerator. For the price, it is the best hotel deal in town.

<Content>Great! We just returned from a three night stay at this hotel. We loved it. Public transportation is right out the front door (bus and streetcar). If you'd rather walk, just head strait down Carondelet - it turns into Bourbon when you cross Canal (6 blocks).Hot breakfast is provided every morning in the lobby. On Sun-Thur, each adult guest receives three complimentary evening cocktails in the lobby.The rooftop pool is small, as is the fitness center.The lobby is beautiful, with marble floors and nice chandeliers. We stayed in a king suite, and it had tons of space, although the bathroom area seemed small. Our teenaged nephew slept on the pull-out sofa, and appreciated all the room he had to spread out. He also appreciated that we had our own tv in the bedroom, so he could have control over the one in the living room. He loved the free internet access, but didn't love the TONS of pop-up ads that came along with it.The king suite had:One bedroom with king bed, two night stands with lamps, entertainment center with television, telephone, and closet. Living area with pull-out sofa, chair, recliner, coffee table, entertainment center with television, refrigerator, and microwave (2 free soft drinks and microwave popcorn provided), and desk area with internet access.The vanity area had another closet, as well as a coffee maker. Parking is $13 a day, which is a bargain. The lot is self-park, no valet, so you have access to your car whenever you need it.Make sure your room key is always handy. You need it to get in and out of the parking area, to use the elevators, and to get into the back entrance (all day) or the lobby entrance (after hours).This was our third trip to New Orleans, and our first stay at the Drury. I think we'll stay here again.

<Content>Would Recommend to Anyone... I booked this hotel based on reviews found on this site, and was pleased above my expectations. I was met upon check-in with complimentary cocktail coupons and snacks, which we had the opportunity to enjoy every evening of our stay from 5:30 until 7:00. The people at front desk were very friendly and willing to give directions and offer advice whenever we asked. Every morning, if you can drag yourself out of bed from the night before, they offer a free hot breakfast from 7:30 til 9:00, which we took advantage of each day of our stay. Also, the hotel is very nicely decorated and clean. Our room had an old hotel charm about it. The floorspace wasn't the largest I've ever stayed in, but the 15-20' ceilings made it feel very spacious but cozy. It is a short walking distance from anywhere in the French Quarter, and it is located just far enough away from the hustle and noise of Bourbon Street.We will definitely be staying here on our next trip to the Big Easy.

<Content>Nice property, great location Chose the Drury largely due to reviews on this page. Lovely property. Great location, on a quiet street about 4 blocks from the French Quarter. Easy walk for those who like to be on foot. The St. Charles streetcar runs in front of the hotel, and the French Quarter minibus runs past the side entrance, which were great options if walking isn't an option. Free softdrinks and popcorn were in limited supply; there was no popcorn and only 2 softdrinks when we checked in. Drank one softdrink on the first day. On the second day they provided a package of popcorn but no more sodas. (However, we also didn't request any additional since we didn't really want them; maybe they would have provided more if we had asked.)Free breakfasts were generous, with eggs, sausage, french toast, biscuits and gravy, fruit, cereals, breads, juices, coffee and do it yourself waffles.Biggest complaint was the pillows, which we dubbed pillow wannabe's.

<Content>Terriby Disappointed I booked a room at this hotel based on the comments from this website. What a disappointment. . . the check in staff were not friendly. When advising them there were no refreshments/popcorn in the room they seemed terribly unconcerned and called back after twenty minutes because they could not remember which room had called and then took another twenty five minutes and only brought 1 regular soda and one diet soda. Found out the pool was closed by a sign posted on the door to the pool area, after inquiring about it at the front desk they gave a very lame excuse. The worst part had to have been the towel after getting out of the shower the next morning and finding the edges tattered. This should have been thrown away, not placed in a guest room!

<Content>Great Hotel @ a Great Price! We were pleasantly surprised when we checked in-From the front desk to our room. Front desk was very friendly and I felt they were geniune in their greetings. Our room was much more than we expected. It was tastefully decorated, comfy and clean. Each room has a microwave  fridge and had an amenity that I don't see at other hotels--microwave popcorn and sodas.A big plus was the FREE FULL Breakfast-scramble eggs, sausage, belgian waffles, you name it they had it. Another great perk were the free drinks at happy hour.We booked through hotels and got an incredible deal for such a lovely hotel. Thanks, Drury. This will be the place we will stay every time we go to New Orleans.

<Content>What a great surprise! I was so pleasantly surprised by the Drury Inn. It was huge, well-kept, and luxurious -- and I had found it at a great discount rate. A colleague was surprised to find that she was put in a suite for only $20 more than my room. The breakfast was amazing, and they have free drinks every evening Mon-Thurs. Free high-speed internet. It was fantastic!

<Content>Great place to stay! This was a great hotel. I was very impressed with just about everything the hotel had to offer. The service was outstanding and they had the best free breakfast I've ever seen a hotel offer. The location is also good because it's so close to the French Quarter and the Garden District. The parking is also great because for one flat daily rate you can take your car out anytime and return with no added costs. I recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Give it a try Hotel located in old phone building. Attractive common areas-great (free) full breakfast and 3 free beverages and snacks in the afternoon; secured parking ($13/day); good location for walking to attractions-quiet-marble baths-tall windows-pleasant staff-reasonably priced, especially considering all the extras. Great access to the St. Charles Streetcar line as the hotel is located midway between Carondolet and St. Charles-perhaps a 2 minute walk. Sign up for their gold club on line and receive points toward free nights. We'll go again ... and again.

<Content>Good location, and Great for the Price! We stayed at the Drury during Halloween weekend. It was easily within walking distance of Bourbon Street and the French Quarter. The staff was very friendly, and the rooms were very clean and neat. I travel frequently and Drury hotels are usually the best in their price range. In this case it was true as well. The price was excellent compared to competitors' and the stay was very enjoyable. The only reason I didn't give this review 5 stars, is that the hotel does not accept preferred customer coupons during the holiday weekend.

<Content>Great staff and Super Nice Rooms! Arrived early at the hotel at 1:30 to check in, and was informed by the friendly staff that the cleaning crew was still working on the rooms. They graciously took my bags to a secure room, and provided me with a key to a downstairs conference room so I could access the internet while I waited. (By the way, this hotel provides FREE high speed internet in every room!) I eventually went to the casino a few short blocks away, and checked in about 6 pm. The girl at the front desk greeted me by my name and had my bags immediately. I was then given drink coupons for the free happy hour in the comfortable and well appointed lobby (lots of black granite, dark wood and brass). The hotel does not actually have a bar, but from 5-7 the breakfast bar area is converted to a tended wine/beer bar for the guests. I carried my bags to the room (I don't believe the hotel has bell captains... at least I did not see any when I checked in) on the third floor. Elevator was clean and so was the entrance lobby/elevator area on my floor. I entered the room and was quite impressed! I had the King suite, and my room had nice, high ceilings. It also had a nice seating area with a large tv and nice desk for work. Around the corner to the bath area... quite clean and spacious with floor to ceiling ceramic tile in the separate bathing/toilet area. The bedroom was also spacious and clean, with its own entertainment center with tv. The bed was quite comfortable. Only few issues would be the towels, linens, pillows and bed comforter... they all reminded me of lower quality used by the more economical hotels chains. Although they were thin, they were clean. The hotel has onsite parking for a very modest price, as well as a nice pool, area. Also, as an added treat, a self-serve breakfast is included. The breakfast itself is nothing fancy for New Orleans... bisquits, gravy, sausage, eggs, french toast, cereals and belgian waffles (you make yourself), but it certainly hit the spot. Overall, I was quite impressed with this hotel. There is not a great deal of service offered ( in terms of concierge, bell captains, room service, etc.) but the staff at the front desk made me feel at home and welcome. They even remembered my name at checkout. I am sure if I needed something they would have made every effort to accomodate me. Other than the towels and linens, the hotel feels like a first class hotel. Will stay again for sure!

<Content>Very Impressed with the Drury Inn! I can't say enough good things about our stay at the Drury Inn in New Orleans. We had a group of 12 stay for about three nights. The staff was VERY accommodating. The rooms were large and we enjoyed having the refrigerator and microwave. They had a nice variety on their Quick Start breakfast and we're pleasantly surprised with their cocktail hour. The staff was very willing to help us make tour arrangements with plenty of terrific suggestions. We will definitely stay there again on our next visit.
