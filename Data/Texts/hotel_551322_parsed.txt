<Content>perfect base for my trip to japan Booked this hotel with my flight to Tokyo for 10 days via expedia and got a great deal.The hotel was easy to find per the directions in prior reviews. I took the Airport express train and then the metro.Beautiful, peaceful lobby setting...it's nice that the lobby is set back from the street. Room was small but typical size for Asian hotels. The bed was hard but again typical for Asian hotels. Green tea dispenser in hallway was nice. Although no in-room internet I was able to find several unsecure wireless networks via my laptop just to access some quick news or look up directions to local sites. All in all a great stay. Would recommend.

<Content>Good value. We booked this hotel after reading another review on this website. It was a clean smart hotel with a great location. Very reasonable rates and very helpful staff. If you are travelling around and are looking for good value for money with a few home comforts this is the place to stay.

<Content>Hotel Ochanomizu is fantastic! Hotel is in a GREAT location - close to Tokyo City and walking distance to at least 3 train stations. Familiar eating places like McDonalds and KFC are just around the corner in Akihabara - we ate there most nights after browsing through the great (and bright) electronic district. Hotel room is small compared to most Western standards, but the luxuries and facilities make up for that. Bathroom  toilet are almost like new, and free inclusions include traditional japanese robes  slippers, toothbrush + toothpaste, shaver, hair brush, shower gel  shampoo. For those who love their morning cuppa, I'd advise bringing your own tea bags, milk  sugar as only green tea is provided. Family Mart is just 2 buildings away - its like a 7 Eleven but much more affordable with lots of variety. We would pop in every night because I developed an addition to Japanese beans, which the Japanese serve with alcohol. Staff are incredibly professional and polite and genuinely go that extra mile to make your stay more comfortable. We loved staying at the Green Ochanomizu and pat ourselves on the back for making such a smart move :)

<Content>Decent inexpensive hotel We stayed for three days at this hotel. Very conveniently located to several Tokyo metro stations within 3 blocks. Taking the cheaper Express trains to Ueno from Narita Airport and then using the subway to Kanda station was definitely an inexpensive way to get to the hotel, instead of the expensive Narita express to Tokyo Station and taking a taxi. The rooms are wicked small. You will definitely have to live out of your suitcases. The breakfast is decent but one has to pay 1200Y. The Hotel staff speaks decent English and were extremely helpful with directions, suggestions. Surprisingly, internet access is free. The Hotel gives you a internet hookup kit to be returned when you check out. For folks on a budget in Tokyo, this is definitely a hotel to consider. There is a decent noodle place across the street.

<Content>Brilliant Stayed here for a week in October of last year and enjoyed every second!Firstly, location couldn't be better, literally 5mins walk from a number of stations including Akihabara(spent alot of time here!)The rooms are compact but have everything you'd need, including fresh kimonos every day, a fridge, kettle etc. There is no drawer space however so be prepared to live out of your suitcase! Each floor had a hot/cold water  green tea machine and there were also some vendors which contained soft drinks, beer  noodles. Staff were very friendly and helped as much as they could, they spoke a small amount of englishThe only thing i'd say is the surrounding area such as Akiba does seem to shut down quite early (8-9pm) save for a few arcades and big places like Yodobashi Camera, so if you're after more of the nightlife Shinjuku might be your place. Trains run really late anyway so you'd still be able to make it back here though!All in all, brilliant, would happily stay here again!

<Content>location great the location for this hotel was great . Finding it was hard , as we got lost , but if you use the JR Line to Kanda station from the airport , it is 10 mins walk only. Good location for the subway , and 7 11 opposite The hotel allowed us to check in early at 1.30 which was a big bonus (normally 3pm ) we had a room on the 10th floor , whch was great with no noise . The rooms are small , with a pod bathroom , but with a tv and free internet , we could no complain ,we would recomend this hotel for people on a budget , who need a good clean base , with a great location

<Content>Not a lot of room Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in a double room. Room was very small but OK. Free internet was provided, if you have your own laptop ask at reception for a modem.Like most hotels in Japan, room was very clean, location was good, not too far from metro. Finding the hotel was difficult on arrival, so make sure you do some homework on how to get to the hotel from the metro station.We did not have breakfast at the hotel  chose to eat at one of the many coffee shops in the area.I would shop around for hotels, this one was OK, but I think there are better.One good thing was that all on reception did speak reasonably good english.

<Content>Great Service, Great Location Me and my girlfriend stayed in the hotel from December 11th through the 23rd. At first we were offput by how small the room was. As the trip went on, we realized how comfortable it was. Keep in mind that there is no closet or drawers so you will have to live out of your suitcase. Great location for the geeks out there. Just a five minute walk from Akihabara and centrally located to JR and Subway Lines. The staff was also extremely helpful. They knew enough english to help us get directions to several locations on our itinerary and even printed out discount coupons which we probably wouldn't have found on our own. The room was also very clean. Every day we would return to fresh towels, sheets, and yukata robes and slippers. My girlfriend was also thrilled with the green tea machines located on every floor. Long story short, if you want a clean, comfortable hotel with a GREAT location, this hotel is for you! We loved it!

<Content>Great location, decent rate, watch out if you have feather bedding allergies This was the last out of the 3 hotels, 1 hostel, 1 onsen ryokan, and 1 college dorm that I stayed in during my 7.5 weeks in Japan. We stayed at Ochanomizu for three days.We had previously had some frustrating experiences dragging all of our stuff around while trying to find other hotels, so we determined that it might be best to just take a taxi to the hotel from the station instead of attempting to find it on our own... well it turns out it's just a little down the street from the station, so it was a very very short taxi ride. I'd recommend trying to find it on foot first unless you have a very significant amount of luggage (although a word of warning: the closest subway exit is a fairly lengthy flight of stairs, and there is no escalator. On a less related note, at the top of those stairs there's a Tully's Coffee, and their Honey Milk Latte is delicious). The lobby of the hotel is nice, and there are a few staff members who speak at least a little English. We arrived before check in time, and there were no problems with leaving our bags there so we could go out for a while (they tagged them and took them to a room behind the counter). Overall, it's actually a really convenient location. There's a 7-11 directly across the street, and te subway station is very much in the middle of things, and is connected by tunnel to a different station, so you can get to a few different lines pretty easily. I don't think we explored the area around the hotel all too much, but there are a few different restaurants and convenience stores.I forget which side of the building we were on, but either way I wouldn't expect a great view of anything from the window (we could see the 7-11 quite well). Our room was a double, for 2 people, and was small but reasonable. Somewhat surprisingly, there wasn't a way to get internet access in the room. There was a small LCD TV mounted on the wall, and a desk. The bathroom was rather small but clean. The bed was pretty big and comfortable but-for those affected by allergies: the pillows and comforter are feathers! I'm allergic to down, so we tried to explain this to the staff (the person who knew more english wasn't there at the time so I used japanese) but it turns out those are the only pillows they have. They did however offer to give us non-feather blankets, which were brought to the room shortly after, so we did what we could and used those as a pillow. If you're really allergic to feather bedding, it'd probably be a good idea to mention this to them prior to arrival, maybe if it happens often enough they can pick up a few synthetic fiber ones. (Note: I didn't have a problem with feather bedding anywhere else I stayed while in Japan). One of my favorite things about this hotel: there's a green tea dispenser in the hallway! It also dispenses hot water, but having a constant supply of (really quite) hot green tea (from real leaves too) is pretty nice (although there was still the usual hot water pot in the room anyway I believe). Seemed quite appropriate for a hotel named 'ochanomizu', tea water.Overall, considering the location the rate was fairly reasonable. Because of this, we'll probably stay there again. Except next I'll probably have to go pillow shopping first...

<Content>A Good Choice Staff spoke basic English and nothing was too much trouble. They arranged taxis that arrived promptly and with the correct instructions, and provided a free keepsafe for valuables. The hotel was very comfortable and exceedingly clean, and complimentary slippers were provided in the bedroom. A clean Yakata (dressing gown) was provided every day, and a constant supply of hot and cold water and green tea were provided free from a machine on the landing. Toileteries were provided and the toilets in the ensuite bathrooms are western style. There is a fridge and kettle for making a drink, but if you don't want green tea you had better bring your own coffee, milk, etc. There are late-night convenience stores nearby.The excellent restaurant provided Japanese cuisine for dinner and a choice of Japanese or Western breakfast, not included in room price. There was also a good Italian Restaurant one block away.It is easy to reach. We recommend the Keisei Skyliner to Oeno Station from Narita. It is reserved seating only, (ticket desk at Airport Station) so there is no problem with luggage and the journey takes one hour. The slow train runs the same route but takes more than an hour and a half and forget it if you have much luggage. All important signs are in English. There is a taxi rank at Oeno and the fare to the hotel was about 750yen - 拢3. It is a good idea to have a printout of the hotel name in Japanese to show the driver - they don't all read or understand English. On the way back be sure to ask the taximan for Keisei Oeno station or you will end up in the JR station.

<Content>This is a keeper ! This hotel is in an excellent location although a little hard to find - I would recommend a taxi from Akihabara station as it is close by but saves the worry of getting lost. The room is small (which is standard for Tokyo) but very clean and the staff are very attentive with basic English. I would definately stay in this hotel again, purely because of the location and price. Check out the hotel's website for a map and address details before leaving : [--] and take a copy in Japanese just in case [--]

<Content>Would stay here again I was a little apprehensive about this hotel because Expedia gave only 1-1/2 stars. We booked it based on other reviews that were mostly positive. We really liked this hotel. The room was small, and the bathroom was really small--but it was very clean. There wasn't any place to unpack; no closet or drawers, instead there are two hooks with hangers on the wall. Bed was very comfortable. They give you slippers and fresh kimonos every day. The bathroom had a washlet toilet. Small TV with only Japanese channels. Machine in hall dispenses hot and cold water and green tea. Staff was very friendly and helpful, but they don't speak very much English, just enough for the basics.Hotel has a nice location. It is on a relatively quiet street. Several metro stations and JR Rail within 5-10 minutes walk. 7/11 across the street. Inexpensive Noodle House from Frommers book around the corner and very good.  We took the Keisei Limited Express from Narita (75 mins, 1000 Yen) then a taxi (900 Yen)For us a very cozy, comfortable hotel.

<Content>A good base for exploring Tokyo After 12 hours on a flight from London, be prepared to travel a bit further when you get off the plane and want to get to your hotel. It took about 90mins to get from Narita airport to the closest Metro stop to the hotel. Taxis cost way too much, so public transport is the best, if only real viable option.Hotel staff are really friendly and are happy to point out any places of interest if asked.Hotel rooms are really small. In the room i had, no space to hang any of my clothes up, so just lived out of a case for the 5 days i was there. But beds were so comfy!If you turn left out of the hotel, you stumble across Starbucks (who make a very good cuppa!!) and right across the road from the hotel is 7eleven.If you just want a base whilst in Tokyo and aren't worried about getting the Metro to places of interest, then there is nothing wrong with this hotel.

<Content>Very Efficient We booked the hotel based on other user's recommendations and a very reasonable price on hotels.com. The room was very small, with no place to unpack but it still felt comfortable. The room comes with slippers and Japanese pajamas. All television channels were in Japanese. We had a great view overlooking the electronic district, and one of the restaurants recommended in our Frommer's guide was right around the corner (it was a noodle house where a woman sings the order to the kitchen). The hotel is close to 2 train stations, a starbucks, and a very popular sushi restaurant open only for lunch. Also within walking distance is the music and books district. There is a very large stationary store with some great oragami paper, correspondance cards, etc. that I highly recommend in the books district. The staff of the hotel were very polite and tried very hard to get us some baseball tickets. One reviewer mentioned a Denny's near the hotel, which we thought was very funny--that someone would go to Denny's in Japan--but we wound up there too. In fact, if you want to try a Japanese breakfast for cheap, that's probably the place to do it. They have a Japanese version of the grandslam, and it was all pretty good.

<Content>Good value and location! This hotel is a really nice value choice pretty centrally located in Tokyo. It's two stations north of Tokyo Station and is accessible to about 4 subway lines in about a five-minute walk.The hotel is clean and well maintained. You do get a small TV with Japanese channels available. They even provide a machine in the hall that gives hot water or green tea. The rooms are smallish but the double bed was enough for me and my wife.The staff's English is not what you would get at the Imperial Hotel so I wouldn't recommend a conversation on the meaning of life. But you can get across what you need. The only thing about the staff is that they seemed to get irritated that I didn't want my room cleaned every day. One warning: if you are over six feet tall or a stocky person I might advise someplace else. The doorway is VERY low and the size of the bathroom could be a problem for you.I believe as the other poster stated, the Kinko's is available for internet access around the corner. I paid around 600-700 yen for about 45 minutes. There are three mini-marts within a short walk. Not bad for quick meals. I recommend the Family Mart about 100 feet down the road. You could pick up a quick sushi plate or rice bowl for 300-500 yen.My four star rating is based on the quality of hotel relative to price. This hotel is on the high end of what you would get for similarly priced hotels in Tokyo. if you want more, then you need to pay more. I paid about $70/night on a package deal.

<Content>Tokyo Green Hotel Ochanomizu--Very Good Deal Stayed at Tokyo Green Hotel Ochanomizu from 30 Sept to 05 Oct 2005 on vacation. Stayed in a single which is an excellent value, and it is the best Japanese hotel experience I have ever had. Lived in Tokyo from 1992 to 1995 and traveled to many Japanese cities and hotels. It is within walking distance of JR (Japan Rail) Ochanaomizu station and the Tokyo Metro (subway) station. Took me about 5 minutes to walk back and forth from the stations. The Kanda Post Office is two doors down from the hotel which makes mailing packages and postcards very convenient. Akihabara--Japan's consumer electronics district--is about 1/2 mile away or about a 15 minute walk at a very casual pace. The JR Ueno station is a 10 minute or 850 Yen taxi ride away. Keisei Ueno station has an express train to and from Narita International Airport for about 1950 Yen each way. Restaurants are not obvious around the hotel, but they are there. Of course, they serve Japanese food, Chinese, and even an Italian place. Starbucks is less than a 5 minutes walk away. Akihabara has many more choices to include McDonald's, Denny's, Wendy's, KFC, and other Westerna chains. I did not eat at the hotel because I had too many other choices.Technically, the hotel does not have a WiFi network, but it is surrounded by many office buildings that have unprotected networks. Next door, there is another hotel with a free WiFi network in the lobby. I was able to find a free high speed connection with very little effort. Had I not brought a laptop, there is a FedEx Kinko's around the corner that offers internet access for a fee. The room had a 13 LCD TV, a pay per view system (1000 yen to watch 5 channels until 10am), a small refrigerator, hot water pot, a hair dryer, but it did not have a clock or radio. Wake up calls were easy to ask for at the front desk or set via the phone. At all hours there were at least 3 employees behind the front desk. One or a combination of the employees were able to answer all my questions in English. I checked out late, and I was charged 400 Yen an hour. Which I thought was a bargain.Do not expect a large room. This is a Japanese business hotel, so it offers the basics. It is designed for shorter customers, so if you are an average sized Westerner, you might find it cramp. Realize that will be true unless you are willing to spend 2 or 3 times what I paid (about $80 US / night).
