<Content>Love The Hotel and People This was our second holiday at the Club Bali Mirage and to say we returned expresses exactly what we feel about the Hotel. It is a great place to relax and chill out. The Management and all the staff at the hotel are extremely kind and helpful. Whatever you want, if they can possibly provide it, you will always get it. We have travelled to many holiday destinations the world over but this is definitely our favourite. There is as much or as little as you want to do. The pool is so warm and cool and never overcrowded. We went on the catamaran most days, weather permitting, and it was absolutely fantastic. The activities are ongoing all day. This year my husband even painted a picture!! If you are more energetic then you can always join in the fun in the sea or in the pool with organised activities. We had a beautiful suite overlooking the pool and reef. There was always something to look at when we were on the balcony. The room was cleaned perfectly daily, clean sheets and towels daily, and anything else you needed then you just ask for. The food was delicious and as much as you wanted to eat. If there was nothing you fancied then the chefs would try and oblige by cooking something special for you. There are some lovely places to visit in Bali - of course depending what you want to see - just book a taxi and you can go where you wish. There is a free hotel bus service every day, to the shopping centre. Hope to be back next year.

<Content>Hotel Good, But Forget The Food... The Hotel itself was very good, as were the staff. Very clean and very friendly. People were always helpful and no request was ever to much trouble... However, on the other hand, it has to be said that the food, very much left a lot to be desired. Everything was based upon a buffet style. Nothing particularly wrong in that itself, except most of the stuff that we personally exeperienced on a daily basis consisted of apparently, rehashed, reheated same old, same old. When ever we would roll back the metal covers where the hot food was kept, we were invariably faced with a dried up, coagulated looking mass, which as time went on, we found increasingly unable to face. Mealtimes were never an experience we particularly looked forward to at the best of times, as items such as pastries, rolls and fresh fruit etc. were always covered over with cling film or netted covers, which were rarely replaced properly by guests, resulting in a congregating fly problem, some of which would become trapped beneath these covers rendering everything most unappetizing.Luckily we found that we had a great selection of good quality and varied local restaraunts to hand, either within adjoining hotels or independent ones within the local area, which it didn't take us long to discover, where we were able to enjoy some exceedingly good food at reasonable prices...On our return to the UK, both myself and my wife have come to the conclusion that after experiencing an all inclusive holiday such as this, we will certainly not be repeating the experience anytime soon. It seems to us that once the holiday Company have safely secured your money in a situation like this, then the quality of the food which they seem to accept as a decent standard to serve up to their guests, is of little or no concern to them at all. What was on the whole, a welcome stress free fortnight of relaxation, could, as far as we are concerned, been a far better experience had the food situation been of a much better and hygienic standard...

<Content>Excellent Value for money Booked through Expedia for two weeks. We were even able to book transfer from airport to hotel. We were picked up from airport and the guide even checked us into the hotel whilst we had a drink- which we really needed after the long flight from the UK.Hotel is bright, clean and spacious. The rooms were cleaned throughly every night and they also sprayed the rooms every night.We had a double four-poster bed, the room was air conditioned and quiet too.Breakfast was stunning, lovely selection of fresh fruit and fruit juices and extra helpful staff!Pool was clean and quiet with a bar near by. The beach was clean and raked every day. Some pesky sellers on the beach but in the end they would get the message.Could not have wanted anything more from this hotel. Affordable heaven, Bali is more than worth a visit!!

<Content>Loved Club Bali Mirage My husband and I stayed at the Club Bali Mirage from 27th September to 12th October 2008. We were very pleased with the hotel. The hotel was clean, bedrooms were very clean. Pool although a bit crowded was good. Beach front location was excellent, very busy with water sports though so if you do not like water sports stay by the pool. Food was good and plentiful. Staff very helpful, we had our 35th wedding anniversary while we were there and they gave us a cake, a garland of flowers and hats to celebrate they were great.We hired a driver and car for two days while we were there to see a bit of the island as it was our first time in Bali. His name is Made Wijaya. We asked him to take us to see the temples, rice fields, monkey forest in fact as much of the island as he could in two days and he did exactly that. My husband does not like shopping so we told him we did not want to go to any shops and he did not try to take us to any. He was very good. He is very cheap aswell and very helpful and polite. His email if anyone is interested is [---]Definately will go back to Bali and will certainly hire Made again

<Content>great place Yes, the wife and I have to agree, the hotel is a grand old lady that is showing her age, but again, that is what we like about her. For a rating of three stars she is more than up to the task, the food was reasonable, the entire hotel staff was great, the beach was more than required, and we could barely get our grand daughter out of the pool. We found it was very easy to get to know the other guests, many of them being from England. If it was not for the 23hr flight to get there we would be back as soon as possible. We cannot think of a single major event during the two weeks that we were on the island that could not be overcome with a little understanding and a sense of humor. Newly-weds may find to pace too slow, and party animals would be bored stiff, but for the laid-back, older, and family orientated guests it could be a very enjoyable place

<Content>Peaceful unspoilt haven My husband and I wanted to get away to the sun. We have travelled to Asia many times and love the people. Our son encouraged us to go to Bali as he loves it and we have never been. First impression was very disappointing, we arrived about 23.30 and the main bar was full, which is just right of the lobby, this was full of mainly French people, who were smoking and dressed in singlets and shorts, looked like they had stayed in the same clothes all day, straght from the beach. We thought we had made a big mistake, but as mentioned before the staff and Balinese people are wonderful. After a day or two once we got used to the hotel as it was a lot smaller than we had been used to, we became accustomed to it. They only use one restaurant at a time either in the main building or down by the, there was a different menu each night and there wasnt as much choice as the Hotel is smaller, but was O.K although we did eat out a couple of times, even though we were All Inclusive.However we enjoyed our stay and was very relaxed by our return home as it was so peaceful and quite ( NOT for people who like to party, we were in bed by 12 . We would return to Bali in an Instant, although probably to another Hotel.

<Content>The All-Inclusive Costa Del Sol Comes to Bali. The hotel itself is okay; I quite liked the layout of the main building - the bar, the restaurant and lobby gave the place a pretty good feel. However, once you get to your room you feel a little disappointed, its not done particularly well when you consider other hotels for a similar price in the area (The Novotel, two doors down absolutely destroys this place for a similar price) and ours smelt a bit. The pool is spacious and warm but you soon become aware of the feel of the place...If you like to lie around a pool for two solid weeks chatting to other Brits and Germans abroad who race out in the morning after breakfast to nab a lounger, fill up on the limited all-inclusive rubbish and swill the cheapest, nastiest beer known to man and venture out of the hotel only to the shop oppositein search of a three day old copy of The News of the World then get down there; but you may as well go to Torremelinos and save yourself a fortune. The place felt cheap and the service was pretty poor - I tried to get stuck into a game of volleyball but felt like I was intruding on a staff game as I was bossed about and pretty much laughed at as I got to grips with the game (of course it was an off day - i'm usually superb) but as I and my fellow German volleyball amateur left the session we couldn't help but sense their relief as we left all the staff going hell for leather at each other on the court.In all, the Costa Del Sol in Bali - get out the South to avoid such a feeling or if you just want to chill in quality surroundings book into the Novotel just two doors up - as I said, it makes this place look like a Costa Del Joke.

<Content>The Very Best - Cannot Fault this Hotel! After a 2 nights stopover in Hong Kong we stayed at the Club Bali Mirage for 12 nights. This is definately the best All Inclusive Hotel we have ever stayed in.The people and staff are brilliant, very helpful and kind, the rooms are lovely, comfortable and have everything you need. The food on the All inclusive was great, you could have food 24hours of the day! If it wasnt meal time you can choose food off of the snack menu and they cook it fresh for you! Drinks - plenty of choices to choose from, Milkshakes, Cocktails and Fresh Juices were also included which we found aren't in most all inclusives!Chopsticks (The Al a Carte Restaurant) is included in the all inclusive (as long as you reserve) and is absolutely delicious!! The hotel is very well situated with shops, restaurants and bars within 2 mins walking distance!The pool is lovely and so is the beach. You do get some people selling things around the hotel but nothing that would ruin your stay there. A polite No Thankyou and they leave you alone.We would definately reccommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Bali!If anyone thinking of Scuba Diving whilst your out there, Ena Dive Centre are a good one to go with!!We WILL be returning to the Club Bali Mirage! An all in all fantastic holiday!

<Content>An amazing honeymoon We stayed at the Club Bali Mirage in Aug 08. We were celebrating our honeymoon and Bali was recommended as the place to try. After looking at loads of reviews for different hotels, the Club Bali Mirage sounded like the perfect option and was within our budget. From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were treated like royalty. Due to us being on honeymoon we had received a free upgrade to a romantic room. This was stunning, we had a pool and sea view from our balcony. We also had a basket of fruit and a cake in our room, which was a lovely touch. The staff in the hotel could not do enough for us. Nothing was too much trouble, The food in the hotel was fine, offering a variety that would cater for any taste. Plus there was the option of eating in the Chopsticks restaurant as many times as you liked.Bali is paradise and The Club Bali Mirage made our honeymoon exactly what we had wished for. It was perfect in every sense and we truly did not want to come home. We will certainly be visiting the hotel again in the future, probably to celebrate an anniversary.

<Content>We want to go back - NOW!!!! We had a two night stopover in Singapore on the way to here which sorted out the jet lag to some extent!Then from the moment we landed at Denpasser we were treated like royalty. A private taxi whisked us to the Bali Mirage, doors were opened, drinks delivered and introductions made.The Balinese people in general and the staff members at this hotel are so genuinely friendly - it is quite humbling.The all-inclusive option meant we were able to have a snack when we arrived, at about 11.30pm. I was expecting some sort of sandwich cobbled together at this time of night but out came 4 beautifully presented fresh meals.The room was lovely with fresh towels daily and dressing gowns and slippers placed in there for us. The cleaning staff greeted you like old friends as soon as you left your room in the mornings and this continued throughout the day from various staff members. My children idolised the sports and recreation staff who played water polo and football with them. I had 5 massages from the therapists near the beach for the price of about half a UK massage.I could go on and on about this place - and all of it would be excellent. I want to live there!!!

<Content>This is honestly a lovely hotel, please read on... Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel all inclusive in September 2007, We had booked it online and compared to all the other all-inclusive deals in bali this one was very resonably priced. The hotel is a four star and is lovely and clean with what some would call 'outdated' decor, but you have to bear in mind that this hotel is not claiming to be the Hilton or Conrad and does actually have a lovely front enterance which the date is laid out in decorative stones every morning by the staff (a nice touch we thought), some intricate and beautiful wall hangings and carved fountains. When we checked it it was about 9pm at night and the staff were very helpful and noticed from our passports that it would be my birthday while we were staying, they instantly gave us and upgraded room and we we later to find out brought a cake, cocktail, flowers and little present out at dinner time on the day of my birthday. The pool was really nice not overcrowded and you could have as many towels as you liked, you could choose to sit at the pool or the beach and it was all very peaceful, there were activitys but you weren't pressured into joining in if you simply wanted to relax. (the fruit carver was really good) I would reacomend going on the snorkle trip, doesn't look much untill you get into the water and then wow!The food was indeed buffet style at lunch time but if you didn't fancy what was on offer then the staff would make you something else off the all inclusive snack list even if it wasn't supposed to be availible during meal service (the staff are so nice they will do anything to make your stay enjoyable) .All in all we have a lovely relaxing time at this hotel and the staff really make it worth while, it may not be upto 'Aussie' standards but what you get for your money is well worth it (unless you book with Virgin who will rip you off where ever you go to). I would only say one negative which is the beach is not for beach lovers (ie to sunbathe and swim in, for watersports its great) but this is clearly stated in many reviews and tour guides for the area so shouldn't come as a surprise. While your are in Bali its also great to get a driver and explore... Dean is the best going.. he has a website just google balis best driver !!!!

<Content>Lovely Little Hotel Stayed 'All Inclusive' at the CBM the last two weeks in June2008. We arrived at the hotel mid afternoon and was met by the Manager and given a refreshing fruit drink while we registered. We were given a room upgrade and found ourselves in a room overlooking the pool and beach.(room 123). The first thing is to praise every member of staff, I have never met such a happy and pleasant group of genuine people, and not for the hope of tips all the time. If you introduce yourself to them, they don't forget and call you by name all the time.The room was spotlessly clean and had clean towels every day and the bedding was changed on a regular basis, although the towels were getting a little on the thin side.The food was an average buffet on most nights but there was always plenty of variety. Breakfast was always worth getting out of bed for, eggs cooked as you want while you wait, decent crispy bacon, fruit, cooked meats, cheese, and other oriental foods.On Thursday nights there is a Mongolian BBQ which is taken outside by the poolside bar, this was excellent and shouldn't be missed. You also have access to the Chinese Restaurant 'Chopsticks' which is next to the Reception Bar area, the only problem with that is, that if you are on all inclusive you only have a fixed menu, not 'al a carte'. A tip for the chinese is to go in when you arrive and ask to see the fixed menus for the week and book a table for a night that has the menu you most favour. Its well worth a visit.While we were there, there was always plenty of sunbeds both around the pool and on the beach and no shortage of beach towels. If you are around the pool there is always afternoon entertainment and Volleyball on the beach at 4.00pm daily.On the beach there are hawkers selling locally made goods, but once told you are not interested they don't pester you.Also on the beach is the watersports office and can be quite busy with jetskis and paragliding etc. this is all booked through 'Bruno' who can also arrange a taxi for the day for you. Don't pay the first price he asks, if you are willing to barter he will reduce the price. We had a taxi for a full day and paid the equivilent of 拢25.00 and the driver takes you where ever you like.There is also a free shuttle bus that leaves the hotel at 17 mins past every hour and takes you to a local shopping mall which is quite nice.A word of warning if you are walking outside the hotel, beware of the man on the motor bike touting for 'time share'. Its the usual thing, open a ticket, win a prize, attend a presentation and win wonderful gifts. This all takes in excess of 4 hours and isn't worth it.The sea is not the best if you enjoy swimming in the sea, its not very deep, and quite weedy.Dont forget your US$25 per person entry visa payable on arrival and departure tax of 150,000 Rupiah per person.

<Content>Rooms and staff nice but hotel is outdated I stayed there with my wife and son and the room we got was actually quite big and clean. The hotel itself is quite outdated and in need of some upgrades. The all inclusive package is not worth it in my opinion. The food and drink menu is different from the regular menu with limited choices and poor quality. It was not the extra $80 that you have to pay. Pool is nice and staff are very friendly.

<Content>Just Good Enough Room was quiet, comfortable. Shower, good and strong. However too strong for the drain....it couldn't keep up so we showered in ankle-deep water. Breakfasts were fantastic, supplying anything a Westerner would want. Didn't try dinner, so can't comment. Had one lunch and wouldn't bother again as restaurants across the road were very reasonably priced, with great food. Try the restaurant up the road with the Opera House sails on the roof: good fun staff, excellent food. The number of jet-skis and para-sailing boats plying the coastal strip unfortunately wafts petrol fumes into the pool area. If you're coming from Australia, you'll probably be disappointed in the colour of the sand: don't expect white! Over-all, the hotel is a little tired, but staff are friendly and helpful. At the right price, this is a comfortable-enough stay.

<Content>Accept the cultural differences of the guests first ! First of all you have to mention the staff here - they are superb, and nothing is too much of a problem. Congratulations to all of them has to be mentioned. and they are the saving grace at this hotel. I stayed here for 2 weeks and have to say the hotel could be quiet, and offers itself to French tourists in the main who can be noisy and unwittingly annoying. Spoiling on a daily basis the calm that could be appreciated if they didnt clog the bar, get drunk ( one drink seems to do it ) and continuously flout the pool side regulations. And on one occasion this did result in a very violent confrontation between these guests and others. Not a holiday memorable moment. They cater for large groups who do take over the small bar area ( which isnt 24 hrs - it shuts at midnight ) And there is little escape from them if quiet is your requirement. That aside its a nice place to stay, on the beach affording a great view of the ocean and very cheap taxi's to Kuta, which is a must for clubbers and good dining enthusiasts alike.Look out for the illegal money changer opposite the hotel, they operate with little aggression but can do magic tricks with your money only Paul Daniels could worlk out. For those who dont appreciate average buffet food the retsuarants locally are a must, and very cheap. Bumba Bali is a must visit. And for $ 6 you can get shoes made in 24 hrs that fit superbly as they are made to measure. There are many advantages to outweigh the arrogance of some fellow guests.Overall great staff, average food, and if your lucky little noise, although I would guess that is not going to happen too often.Would I stay here again ? No - the reasons are stated here, would I reccomend this hotel - yes - but beware of the potential for others with little or no manners spoiling your quiet time.

<Content>WONDERFUL what else can one say What a wonderful place to stay. The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly and went out of their way to please. First all inclusive where the drinks were not watered down, like other places we could name. Food was good. Even to the point you could have had snacks and drinks 24-7 if you wanted. So if you didn't like what was on offer you could order something else, outside of meal times. They also had a Chinese resturant called Chopsticks that you could eat in still at no charge to all inclusive guests, but you had to pay for specials like Lobsters but that was so cheap. You still got your wine and drinks included. If using Chopsticks you have to book through Reception also you can use it at lunch times as well. Entertainment was good and free and varied.All rooms were Air Conditioned which was good. Free drinking water provided every day, beds changed and towels also. Dressing gowns provided.We will certainly return to this Hotel in the near future.

<Content>great value We stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks in January 2008 and had a wonderful time. The rooms were large and spotlessly clean, as was the whole hotel. The staff were - without exception - courteous and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The food was good and varied and fresh. The hot food was always hot and the salads and soups were always excellent. There were many water based activities available for no extra charge on the all inclusive deal and the pool and surrounding grounds were all immaculate with free beach towels provided. We had a memorable holiday and will return to this hotel, possibly one September, when we are reliably informed by the staff that the humidity is not as high.

<Content>It was Okay... This was our 3rd time to bali and on this trip we stayed in 4 different locations. Club Bali Mirage was location number 3. It was a honeymoon, the staff was friendly and provided a nice welcome. The hotel however was easily 30 years old and the website pictures OVER sold the property. If you plan on staying on the small property and not exploring anything else in the Bali than it might be worth your money. THe all inclusive portion is expensive considering the food was 3/10 at best and the food was recycled. On Roman day we had lasagne and on Greek day the same dish was moussakka. Secondly, all of the all-inclusive activities are run out of the sister resort, next door quite trouble-some to be jumping between properties and as the sister-resort is larger, newer and fancier most of the guests had occupied the equipment. Again, we were looking for smaller, intimate etc... but this was largely for people to drink their worth in the all-inclusive, reserve their beach chair for 7am and not move til midnight etc...Bali is known for it's boutique hotels, villa stays and small new places to discover. Club Bali Mirage is an average hotel that could be found in Cancun Mexico, Phuket Thailand or any other heavily populated tourist beach destination.

<Content>Good place to stay Arrived at the Hotel in the evening, the room was comfortable, clean  the air conditioning worked perfectly  quietly, there was also a hairdryer, fridge with water  soft drinks provided daily  cable TV. Rooms were serviced on a daily basis and the staff were always cheerful and smiling and couldnt do enough to help.Meals were buffet style and the food was plentiful, however after the first week we had gone through the menu  whilst they were catering for various nationalities we got bored with the food and ate out. This is also cheap and the local restaurants provide a good range of indonesian  european menus.The beach was ok, but not what the picture of Bali conjures up, it was busy, with Banana rides, jet ski`s etc and the sea was not exactly clean there. However it was warm and many ventured into it. There were enough sun beds for everyone  towels provided around the pool.Many guests were there for between 2 weeks to 3 months with many returning year on year, this is a recommendation in itself. There are approx 96 rooms which meant you actualy met other people unlike the surrounding larger hotels with 3 times the rooms that appeared half empty. Also be aware of the timeshare reps there, if you go into Kuta and have a meal dont fill in the restaurant questionnaire about the food. You will receive phonecalls stating that you have won a week or other prizes. Also street surveys, these are another avenue for them to get your details and again you will win a week.All in all we enjoyed our stay the Club Bali Mirage and would use it again.

<Content>Great place to chill out My wife and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon on a 20 night all inclusive basis. As many of the other reviews have pointed out, the staff were exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to ensure that we enjoyed our stay. After two nights we upgraded to a suite with an amazing view overlooking the pool and better still the ocean. The suite was huge, the cost very reasonable and the upgrade hassle free. This is a small but perfectly formed hotel and you can utilise the facilities of a neighbouring hotel. Our main purpose for choosing Bali was the scuba diving and we were not disappointed, completing dives in various locations (we used Mola Mola dive centre which I can highly recommend). If you choose to eat out there are some amazing restaurants offering wonderful food for very little cost. A starter and main course with drinks cost approximately 拢10 per person. In all a great honeymoon in a location that now has a special place in our hearts.

<Content>Delighted with the Club Bali Mirage We stayed 3 nights at the Club Bali last week,and were amazed by the warmth of its staff .The rooms were clean and the photos we saw were true.This hotel is a must choose for those travelling with small children.We travelled with our two sons aged 8 and 4 and they were kept busy with in hotel activities,when we used the spa .There is Table tennis,video games and others for a good relaxation.The pool is nice and so is the beach next to the hotel(This is a beach side hotel).The break fast is decent.The hotel runs a shuttle to Nusa Dua area(bali Collection)We were upgraded to a suite at no charge.The deluxe room looked pretty decent as well.The in room internet was expensive,we found a couple of internet cafes just outside the hotel which were very convenient.We also chose a spa near the hotel which was very good.The Hotel also offers water sports.We used a car organised by the hotel which we negotiated and got a good deal for local sightseeing which we highly recommend.There are also local performances at the hotel.,we are vegetarians ,and they managed to organise a vegetarian meal.We did not choose the all inclusive option(and yes they do warm up outside meal)This trip was made special by Club bali and we would deifinitely stay at the hotel again,and yes they did accomodate our request for a late check outReviewed by Mahesh Singapore

Food and drink were freely available - beware the measures on those drinks though - especially the Araq. The free snorkelling was a wonderful experience and we really enjoyed our stay. The staff were constantly smiling and genuinely interested in how you were doing, I cannot fault them.....even when we were a little unruly! I would definitely recommend this place, no hassle on the beach, a great massage at the hotel (bettre than that offered on the beach) at a very reasonabel rate. I had about 6 goes, relax for an hour and have your troubles massaged away while a gentyle breeze plays across your back.My only issue was the food could have been a little fresher, probably a problem to cooking vast quantities for rock bottom prices.

<Content>great place What a fantastic hotel.Made very welcome from the moment we arrived.The hotel very clean. Staff wonderful and will do anything to help.During our stay my partner became poorly with high fever and high blood pressure and went to see the staff at reception and they organised for the in house nurse to make a visiti to our room. The nurse was wonderful despite being 8 months pregnant. The nurse did her job and within a few days my partner was feeling alot better, the whole staff in the hotel either rang my hotel room or stopped me while out and about to ask about my partner.Did see in an earlier view a mention about tipping. The usual tip is around the 10,000 rp which works out about 65pThis is an hotel well worth the money.

<Content>Great Hotel. Fantastic Staff . Nice place to relax We have just returned from Bali having spent 17 nights at Club Bali Mirage. Whilst the hotel was 90 percent full, every guest was made welcome by the senior management, guest services and all staff. We found the room, publc areas and other facilities to be above average for a 4 star hotel. All inclusive at this hotel ment the food, drinksand bottle water were served 24 hrs. Choice of food was good to meet every requirement but at times the food could have been a bit warmer when served. The entertainment in the evening was varied and also hadlocal flavour. The hotel has a perfect location for site seeing, shoping and all types of beach activities. My only regret is, I wished we dad another week at this palace. I will return to Club Bali Mirage next year to spend at least 3 weeks. Great country, Greatpeople, great food and most all your money goes a long way.Mr and Mrs Vaz. from Bedfordshire

<Content>Great Staff We have just come back from the Club Bali Mirage where we had spent 8 days. The Hotel is a perfect size for families, only 98 rooms in total. The staff were very friendly and they loved our son. We went for the all inclusive package which was great as it included all meals and drinks so all other money was just for fun. There are some great resturaunts around the hotel if you don't want to eat in at very reasonable prices. Chopsticks resturaunt in the hotel is exceptionally good albeit always a set menu. The buffet for the most part was vert good although not great for kids if they don't like Asian food. The hotel has a great snacks menu that has burgers and hotdogs so the kid can eat outside of the normal meal times. The ground of the hotel are very well presented for an older Hotel, and the pool is of a good size. As a guest of the Hotel in the all inclusive package you can take advantage of the water sports from the sister hotel the Grand Mirage next door.The beach was very clean and the only hassle you might face is from the the locals selling water sports, a polite no is usually enough to get them away. Don't go to turtle island as it is essentially an animal exploitation area were the animals appear to be drugged.Club Bali Mirage Tanung Benoa gets the real thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Great holiday at the Club Bali Mirage We have juste returned from a memorable holiday at the Club Bali Mirage, Bali. The whole trip went without a hitch and the stay at the Mirage more than made up for the long flight. A small, very friendly hotel with good facilities and well situated next to the beach and close to shops. The room was spacious and clean, food excellent and staff polite and very helpful. Had some memorable trips around Bali. made some good friends in the intimate atmosphere of the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves throughout our stay. We would not hesitate to recommend the holiday.

<Content>Great Time had by all We stayed here after a hectic 5 days in Hong Kong. I would recommend it for families with young Children as it's small and self contained and the staff couldn't be more helpful. There's a snack menu available out of meal time which the kid's used regularily but the adults in our Party found the Food and Drink greatly to our liking. Bali itself is fascinating and the local taxi's are incredibly cheap and much better value than the tour's as you can chose your own timings and destinations.We will certainly be going back.

<Content>Second trip! We stayed at the Club Bali Mirage in August 2006 for 14 nights and liked it so much that we returned again in August 2007 for 17 nights. It still wasn't enough! We had an ocean/pool view suite which was excellent. The staff were really friendly and helpful and always smiling. The new manager who is Spanish was very nice, he made a point of introducing himself and asked us if the room was ok and and if there was anything that could be done to generally improve the hotel. The food was good, a very varied choice and I have to say the 'Mongolian BBQ' was out of this world.We were 'all inclusive' which is excellent value for money. Not only does it include food (available 24/7), soft drinks and locals beers and spirits but also non motorised watersports. There is also free use of the gym, internet etc at the Grand Mirage Hotel next door.We are planning to return next year, hopefully for 3 weeks maybe even longer if we can! We could not fault this hotel and would highly recommend it for couples, families and singles. Everyone is very friendly.I cannot wait to return!!

<Content>The second visit. After we stayed at the hotel in Aug -Sept last year, we returned to meet with friends from the UK. The booking was handled by a very competent travel agent in Australia who informed us that the hotel had emailed her company assuring us of many refurbishments in the hotel. Quite frankly, I can't see how they can class a new shower curtain, kettle and telephone as refurbishments when the cupboard doors won't open and the plumbing is defective. The prices they have begun charging at the bar have risen dramatically, on my rough calculations it is 110% increase on last years prices but the prices outside of the hotel have risen only slightly.The accounting section of the hotel administration must have had a bad week while we were there, that is the only explanation I can find to their rude treatment of our friends insisting that they take back American Express travellers cheques that they had presented to the hotel for cashing and had been accepted one day only to be told the next that they were invalid due to the fact that they had a bank name on the cheques . Along with the travellers cheque debacle, the hotel then presented us with a check out account bearing another rooms credit card transactions and totalling several million rupiah.To anyone thinking about the Club Bali Mirage, think again and check all possible venues before booking there. I cannot recommend it as any value at all after past experiences in Bali.If you do go there and have problems, it appears to be of no use asking to see the manager, he appears to be permanently on days off , although he is seen regularly in the hotel.

<Content>Great small family hotel Small, neat hotel. We spent two weeks with our two young children (aged 3 and 7) on an all-inclusive deal. Because it's a small hotel you get to know the staff well all of whom were polite, friendly and always willing to help. The children spent virtually all day either by or in the pool. Great mix of guests ranging from european (Brits, French, Germans, Russians) to asian (Japanese, HK Chinese, Koreans) meant that there was always a varied choice on the menu along with good local food. I have to agree with the other review on here that said that if your children don't like what's on the menu there's always the snack menu with burgers and fries etc. The beach is clean and the hawkers are no problem. The 'sea' in front of the hotel is in fact a small tidal lagoon, with a reef about 1/2 a mile out. When the tide is in there are all sorts of watersports on offer (available from Grand Mirage) and when the tide is out it's sand flats with wading birds on.There are plenty of shops and restaurants on the road behind the hotel for when you get bored, including a 24hr shop directly opposite for life's little luxuries (namely, chocolate!).Taxis are very cheap - about 拢12 to Kuta (the main tourist/shopping area) - the driver will drop you off and then wait for you until you have finished. Drivers and guides can also be booked for sightseeing - don't even think about hiring a car, I'm sure there are rules to Balinese driving but I'm damned if I could work them out.Hotel positives: Small but uncrowded hotel with fantastic staff. Reasonable all-inclusive menus. Great pool.Hotel Negatives: Unusually for me - nothing.Best experience of the holiday: Riding an elephant at the Bakas elephant park.

<Content>honeymoon we went there in jan of this year for our honeymoon. right from the moment we arrived it couldn't have been better. all the staff were really nive and friendly. we stayed there for 14 days and we went for the all inclusive package. our room was really big, it was cleaned every day also every evening it was sprayed with mosquito spray. the hotel provide great ertainment nights and also had great amminities e.g. pool,games rooms,resturants room servise. we used the hotel to book taxis for our sightseeing and we were charged quite reasonably, for a day it cost around 50 euros, taxi driver also acted like a tourist quide. very entertaing.  we found this hotel perfect as was right on the beach catered to all our needs, the area was quite but you still had shops and resturants of vairety to pick form, it was also near kuda 20 minutes in taxi and is great for shopping and pubs and nightlife. we throughly enjoyed our holiday and would recommened the trip.

<Content>Fantastic Bali Just returned from our stay the the Club Bali Mirage. FANTASTIC. Staff were always smiling and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We were in Bali to attend our daughter's wedding (she was staying at the Melia Bali 5* hotel in Nusa Dua) but much preferred our hotel to hers as the staff made it so personable. On the last day they even stood on the steps of the hotel waving union jack flags to wave us off! Hotel clean and breakfast fine, always a different choice every day. Food not exactly how you would want it at home but you are In indonesia and the hotel has to cater for numerous nationalities (mostly Japanese) so feel they did admirably. Beach fine and although previous reviewers did not like the seaweed on the beach, at the end of the day it is a beach and surely that is just what should be on it. (At my daughter's hotel the beach was sanitised and everything cleaned and pristine - not my idea of a holiday!)Hawkers on the beach could be a pain but just say no. Fascinating to see the local people visit the numerous shrines around the hotel every day to bring flowers (our room overlooked the temple next to the hotel). Do visit the elephants and have a ride on them. Again staff so friendly and took all photos for all our party (14 people in all) when we were actually on the elephants. LOvely people. Nice also to go through the countryside and see the paddyfields etc and the locals as they live.WARNING: Don't let the porters at the airport take your luggage off the carousel as it will cost you. if you need a taxi at the airport turn right as you go out of the terminal and there is a designated taxi shop who will only charge you the correct rate. I paid 90,000 rupiah to the hotel (拢5) but members of our family paid 360,000 (拢20) as they just hailed down a taxi.Will definitely return. Thank you Club Bali Mirage.

<Content>Brillant!!!! We have just returned from our fantastic two week stay at the Club Bali Mirage and I can say it was just brilliant. The hotel is small and intimate and the staff absolutely superb. These are really nice friendly people and yes the people on the beach and streets are trying hard to make a living and will approach you but this is just the culture here.The food was brilliant and the all inclusive great value for money, although the menu appears to be rotated on a weekly basis. However there are some good local restaraunts within easy walking distance if you fancy a change. We tried Chopsticks (the in house a la carte option) but vowed not to return - there was a lack of atmosphere and prefered the buffet style eating. Enterntainment was quite limited but this was not a prolem to us.The beach was a little dissapointing, as you needed good beach shoes to go into the water but apart from this it was fine - there were however several dogs on the beach but they don't approach you and it is easy to keep your distance. There are good watersports facilities available for a reasonable price. The pool is lovely and well kept - my young children absolutely loved this holiday as it was a very safe environment with the staff making time for them to feel special. Although there is a Kids Club my children didn't try it as it was inside the hotel. Good quality clean towels are provided for pool/beach use.Everyone here gets to know your name and you are thoroughly looked after which is for me a great base for a truely relaxing holiday!!I would return tomorrow given the chance........

<Content>Strange, but enjoyable Stayed here fir 5 nights in June - All Inclusive.The hotel is generally in need of updating, especially in the rooms. We arrived and instantly thought, on no.The next day however we woke up and went down to the pool, which is quite pleasent and up to date. The staff were incredibly friendly, and only too happy to help, which is probably the best thing about the hotel.The food on the whole was very good. Most nights dinner was situated by the pool, with a very good band on Friday / Sunday. Lunch again by the pool, with a buffet. We did not try Chopsticks as it didn't look to appetising! Only one night did we take a look at the food and decide to go out. (They basically have a different theme of food each night)We attended breakfast once and skipped it after that. It wasn't nice at all, so as all incluive guests we just ordered snacks of the menu instead.All drinks and cocktails etc were included, which really makes the holiday cheap.Now, I say it was strange as the hotel was operating at 20%! I have never experienced anything like this. It was so quiet. We did not mind as we had the pool at our disposal, and didn't have to worry about people getting up and taking all the sun lounges. I felt so sorry for the staff though, who for 90% of the time were standing around waiting for someone to order something etc. The hotel also had quite a lot of Eastern European and Japanese, which wasn't a problem, although you are unlikely to make any friends if you only speak English ;-)On the whole I would say stay at this hotel for sure, I'd also recommend the all inclusive. You could always do all inc for a few nights and then room only for another couple.We then went on to stay at the 5* Laguna Nusa Dua, which is a completely different experience all together. I missed the all inclusive drinks for sure!NBThe roads and beach around here are what Bali is all about, and comments about infrastructure on previous reports are obsurd. If you want infrastructure then go to Tokyo / New York on your holidays. Bafoon!!! Bali is always about cheap , good food, sun, friendly people.One tip is to just be stern and say NO to people when approached to buy something (on the beach / on the road), or they may never leave you alone! Again, this is just part of their culture and should be respected.

<Content>Disappointing Firstly, I should point out that the Balinese people are 90% Hindu, but they seem to be suffering from the illusion that this is a Moslem island. Perhaps, this explains why the hotel was only operating to 40% capacity. Prior to the infamous bombing incident (not in this area), that figure was 75%.We did not opt for the all-inclusive package which would have been a mistake had we stayed any longer than a week. The reason is that the restaurants in the surrounding district, whilst serving an excellent local menu, offered little else in the way of choice. There are only so many times one can eat Nasi Goreng!The staff were very kind and helpful, although it pays to locate the best English-speaker as soon as possible.If you prefer the comfort of an air-conditioned eating environment, you will be disappointed, but we found the same was true of the outside restaurants we used. Food is a mixture of Asian and European cuisine and the choice was adequate if not inspired.The hotel was clean and tidy, although the towels could have been laundered better. If the hotel had been operating at normal capacity, the pool would probably have been regarded as too small.The beach was very disappointing. In certain spots, there were piles of rubbish and there were stray dogs roaming the beach area. The too numerous beach vendors, especially those involved with water sports, can be persistent to the point of irritation. Finally, there is no lifeguard service and the operation of water sports is entirely in the hands of the locals, so caution is advised.Travelling to and from the hotel is a test of patience and endurance. The roads and general infrastructure are terrible. Allow plenty of time for journeys. We booked taxis through the hotel. Also use the hotel for foreign exchange as the local 'licensed' street vendors will cheat you, given half a chance.For business services, e.g. broadband connection, use the 'sister' hotel (Grand Mirage) which is practically next door.Overall, a pleasant hotel set in a beautiful part of the world but, sadly, let down by a polluted, primitive infrastructure that does not inspire the traveller to return for further exploration.

<Content>Lovely Hotel A really good hotel with nice rooms and a view of the beach. Food was quite expensive and found that we were the only english speaking people there. There were a lot of Russion and eastern european people there as well as japenese. Be careful when you agree to take a car out for the day as we used a guy who never came back to collect us after dropping us at a restaurant. Trips seem to be cheaper if you do not book through the hotel (as they normally are), we went with a lady from a restaurant outside and it was worth it. We had breaskfast every day from the restaurant across the road and it was really nice, along with the people. Its worth doing the elephant safari and the volcano but be careful of locals trying to sell you puppies for $1 when you get there. the fly fishing water activity is fantastic and make sure to barter with the beach boys as they will come down in price. Massages are excellent by the women on the beach, about 拢4, cheaper than the spa. Food at hotel is lovely, expecially the beach bar in the day. Drinks are not that sheap. Not a lot to do in Nusa Dua. Kuta is ok but once again, lots of japenese teenagers in the bars. We went not long after the October bomb and it was quiet, things may have changed now but al in all a wonderful trip and nice hotel.

<Content>very relaxing We stayed in this hotel in Oct 06. Had a great time and found the hotel easy to relax in. We had a lovely room that had a super king size bed in it. Found the mosquito nets very useful. They also provided robes in the room which was handy. The only small downside was that the food became very repetative in the second week although that is the same with most all inclusive hotels. The staff were friendly and service was good. On the first night we were in a room next to some people who were playing very loud music until quite late. We were moved striaght away without any fuss.Extremely good value for money.

The food was always plentiful and with plenty of choice.As other reviewers have said beach was a bit sea weedy, not enough to put you off it as it was beautiful. We went on a couple of trips when there and although were very interesting were early starts, very tiring if people not too fit because of the tremendous heat. A worth while location to visit.

I just came back, no children, no noise, just the friendliest people i have ever come accross. the hotel is small and friendly, so you get to talk to people and hear their tales from around the world if you choose to or just laze by the pool or on the beach and dream of everything you are not missing from home, as nowhere compares to the beauty of bali
