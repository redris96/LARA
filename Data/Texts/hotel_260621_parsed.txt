<Content>You can do better. The bottom line is, if you want to get any sleep you should find a different hotel. This one is set within a few feet of a very busy road and the mattress on the bed feels like six inches of foam rubber set on a board. The rooms are tiny even by European standards. The room was clean enough and there is a gas station nearby if you have a rental car to fill up which we did. We were booked at the Holiday Inn Express the night before a flight by the company that invited us to Germany. Obviously none of them had ever stayed there. I recommend paying more and staying at the Sheraton Frankfurt Airport instead.

<Content>Good value, good location - just as expected Stayed here or one night at the end of a short business trip. We dropped the hire car off in the evening and then got the shuttle bus to the hotel. Flew out the next morning. About 10-15 min shuttle from T1. Just called from the coutesey bus stand using the free phone. Waited 5 min. All very efficient. Shuttle every 1/2 hour. But you need to use the free phone to book a seat if it's busy.Fast and friendly check in. The ladies spoke excellent english and were very helpfull. 3rd floor room. 2 lifts. Normal HI Express room - plenty of space- very clean with all you need. Hair dryer, TV (CNN, but no BBC world). Good double bed. Plenty of storage. Nice bright bathroom - good shower. Shaver point.No restaurant, but sandwiches and soft drinks. Pleasant if plain bar area. Drinks not too expensive for Frankfurt. We asked reception about local restaurants.  about 100m across the road. One was Italian (but in a marquee!!). The other was German with good hearty food. Great soups and good mains. euro 32 for 2 persons and including 2 glasses of wine each. Great , great value.Excellent breakfat. Not 5*, but plenty of choice and good juices and nice coffee. The food was restocked regularly and I could saw nothing run out, even thought it was quite busy.Check out took less than 2 minsYou have to book the shuttle the day before as ours was full. The bus only has 8 seats, but it runs every 1/2 hour. 5 euros. Again very good value as compared with a cab.Sure it's not actually at the termional, but most airport hotels aren't. Just look at the cost to stay at the Sheriton near T1.Only slight downside was from some road noise, as I had a front facing room. Didn't stop me having a good nights sleep after a few glasses of local wine.We paid euro 124 per room plus 5 for the shuttle, including a good breakfast. That is very good value in Frankfurt. And it's very clean and efficient. I've used HI Express a lot and I like their format. Perfect for an airport stay, but not for a romantic weekend.

<Content>Eastcoast approves! A good place for an overnight stay before an early flight.Ratings out of 10:Hotel Quality = 7Location = 8 (good for getting to the airport in about 10-15 minutes)Service = 8Food = (breakfast included but we left too early to try it)This was a decent hotel at a good price for a late arrival before our early morning flight. Unfortunately, the other couple's room smelled like smoke when they had requested a non-smoking room.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Good Value, Good Breakfast I had two one-night stays their in February. I enjoyed the hotel very much and would highly recommend it. The breakfast was standard European continental. I even enjoyed the pizza at the little bar/cafe in the hotel.

<Content>Pretty ordinary We booked on the hotel website and paid far too much for this average stay. The rooms are clean and the hotel is okay in general- actually the breakfast was great, def not too busy and nice food. But unfortunately the beds were rock hard and the pillows are filled with beanbag beans rather than filler, which is totally not appreciated after a long-haul flight!! Those cheap touches were really irritating. Also the bar below emptied glass bottles into the skip bin under our window at about 4am for a good half hour, there goes the sleep again... Not a great stay but we survived one night and the breakfast redeemed it somewhat. The internet is free in reception if you have a wireless card on your laptop.

<Content>Horrible experience - and not near the airport Our last night was the only hotel that was not booked prior to going to Europe and that was a big mistake. We booked this thinking, due to the name, it would be near the airport. It was not - a solid 15+ minutes away which meant a big cab fare to get to this from our other hotel in Frankfurt. Then they say they offer a shuttle - well first of all, it's not free, and second of all - there is only one and it was so full, my boyfriend and I could not even get on the same one (you schedule the night before) and they don't always drop their passengers off at the same locations so we ended up getting separated and never found each other in the airport. Breakfast? Free, but over run - so busy there were no places to sit, no milk, no spoons - I ate dry cereal with a fork out of a bowl....and lastly, our non-smoking room reeked of smoke, you could not get an elevator in the morning for at least 15 minutes....overall, a terrible experience. This was the only night of my 13 day trip that I did not enjoy and the only hotel I did not give a good review. Stay away.....

<Content>Good value if you're looking for close to the airport We booked this hotel because we had an early flight and were looking for somewhere near airport, for 1 night, at a decent rate, with an airport shuttle service. This ticked the boxes.There isn't anything fancy about this hotel, but it met our needs and was good value for money (79 Euro on hotel site). It is not somewhere we would stay for more than 2 nights, or if we were in Frankfurt as a tourist to see the city...too far out.If you've stayed at HI Express hotels before, this is of the same standard. Good facilities, a bar (no rest. but some food avail at bar), free continental breakfast for all guests, secure and smoke-free (on request) rooms, helpful staff. There is a pay-to-access computer in lobby. Round-trip shuttle to airport is 5 Euro/person. Starts at 6am. Cautions are that the rooms on the small side, a bit of noise, and there aren't many services near the hotel. We recommend eating at the airport before catching shuttle to hotel, if you need lunch/dinner.

<Content>Cheap hotel option near Frankfurt Airport Spent a night here before flying out back to Singapore the next day. Unfortunately due to delays coming out of Munich got into Frankfurt after 11pm and therefore past operating time for the hotel shuttle. Had to take a cab, which as per the hotel website, was EUR22, and about 10 minutes drive away.Room was clean, bed comfortable and away from the road so it was very quiet. Free tea and coffee in the room but no fridge or mini bar - vending machines are located in the lobby. Due to my late arriving I didn't try any of the hotels amenities (what there was) but there was an internet terminal in the lobby which I think was EUR5 for 15 minutes. Quite expensive. There was an extra charge if you wanted to watch satellite TV in your room. Rate included breakfast which was pretty decent. Tea and coffee, apple and multi-v juice, milk, cereal, toast, fruit, croissants, pastries etc etc. I paid EUR55 for the night booking through the hotel website, compared to the advertised rate by the roadside of EUR79 per night. This was at least EUR40 cheaper than what I could find elsewhere for the same night. Took hotel's shuttle to the airport for EUR5, which leaves every half hour (book night before checking out).All in all happy with the experience and would stay there again if I couldn't find anything closer / cheaper.

<Content>Noisy!!! Poor breakfast. Basic rooms This hotel is located on a busy road and all rooms are noisy. The breakfast is fair. Do not eat at the recommended Italian restaurant across the road. There were flies everywhere, bad ham, teriible beer and a bad attitude. It was clean

<Content>Bad Choice We were initially given a room with a window two feet from bus parking. The noise was terrible. They did move us. Hotel accomodations are very similar to a freshman dormitory room. Air conditioner did not work well (if at all). The coffee cups in the room were sticky from previous customers. It change our picture of Holiday Inn Express forever.

<Content>Great Value Spent 1 night here before catching a plane back to the States. The rooms are extremely clean and quite roomy by European standards. The Front Desk was helpful and attentive. Breakfast selection was very good. Even though there isn't a restaurant on site, there are 2 restaurants within a 3 minute walk of the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a convenient place to stay for 1 or 2 nights.

<Content>Great Value Spent the night before catching plane back to the states. The hotel room was extremely clean and well taken care of. Good size for a european hotel. Very good breakfast with a wide assortment of food. Even though there isn't a restaurant on site, within a 3 minute walk is a choice of 2 restaurants. We tried the German restaurant; food was good and reasonably priced. This hotel is a great deal for the money. My only complaint is that our room faced the main street and there was a bit of traffic. Ask for a room that faces the rear.

<Content>Good Airport Hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night before flying back to the US. The hotel is about 15 minutes away from the airport and there is a shuttle service, which costs $5 per person. We had booked via an internet travel agency, and had no problems upon check-in. The room is on the smaller side, with modern furniture and appliances. The bathroom is good-sized, clean and a hair dryer is provided. Towels and sheets are very clean. There is wireless internet connection in the lobby for free, but you have to pay 15 euros if you want internet access in the room. We were surprised that there was no minibar.Breakfast was included in our package. The buffet is pretty good: boiled eggs, sausages, varieties of cheese, cold cuts, fresh bread, yoghurt, cornflakes, muesli, juices, tea and coffee. The only downside is it was really crowded and you had to wait in line to get coffee. The staff at the front desk speaks very good English and is friendly. They can also direct you to the one Italian restaurant across the street. The food was good and cheap. We also had an ice cream in the biergarten on the other side of the street. The ice cream was good but beware! The place was swarming with mosquitos!Overall, I would recommend this hotel for its location, service and price. It is a neat, little hotel to spend the night before returning home. I would stay here again.

<Content>Fabulous! I wrote last week about all Holiday Inn Express being the same except for staff, which is true.This is a gem, lovely people and good food.Very clean, well managed hotel.The big thing for me, although it may sound daft, was to arrive later than planned, drained of all energy and knowing the hotel did not have a restaurant and I faced marching off into the German night to find something. Imagine my delight when I discovered they did Pizzas at the bar, and very big ones at very good, like 鈧? prices.I loved it!

<Content>Convenient to Frankfurt Airport Booked on-line in advance at priorityclub.com for 45 Euros... a value in Germany. Clean, comfortable, ultra-modern room in new facility. Shuttle to airport can be booked for 5 Euros. Free breakfast buffet is extensive! Perfect final night near airport. Not the place to stay necessarily as a tourist wanting to see Frankfurt, but perfect for the night before flying home to USA.

<Content>Okay This is the second time that I have stayed here. It is convenient for the Frankfurt Airport, if you coming from the south. I generally like HI Expresses if I am just looking for a bed overnight.The last time I had a room facing th e back, and although small, it worked out fine. On this stay, I had a room on the front, facing the main road and it was very noisy at night. The trucks and cars were quite loud. The rooms are small, but cosy and clean.I did not access the internet, but it was available. I had to pay 9 Euros to park in their own lot. I thought this was a rip-off, but by Frankfurt hotel standards this is not expensive. The airport is about a 10 mins drive from the hotel - very easy to get to. The room was 119 Euros (again, high priced area). The included breakfast was ok, nothing special, and it was quite crowded at breakfast both times I have been there. I did not see a restaurant nearby (there is a bar in the lobby), so I would not arrive hungry.I had recently stayed at the Stiegenberger Hotel, which is right next to the airport and had a weekend rate, which was cheaper than the HI XPS. It was a much nicer hotel, better location, nice room, etc.. I will probably be staying there next time. The food is expensive there, but there is a petrol station right around the corner, where you can purchase sandwiches, snacks, drinks and just about anything. I have also stayed at the Holiday Inn at Frankfurt Airport, but was not impressed with it.

<Content>Excellent Airport Hotel Whenever I have a long layover or need to stay close to the Frankfurt airport I stay here. The rooms are basic but modern and very clean and new. There is high speed internet access in the rooms for a small fee and free wifi in the lobby.The breakfast is not worth the extra price if it is not included in your rate.The best part is that there is a great little Italian restaurant a 3 minute walk away that is open for lunch and dinner everyday. But there is no other restaurant facilities onsite except for breakfast.The airport shuttle bus to and from the hotel is prompt and easy to use. Staff are efficient and friendly.And usually the best rate can be had by going to the hotel booking desk in the arrivals hall at the airport and having them book for you. Day rates are usually available for a slight discount as well.

<Content>Highly efficient airport hotel This hotel is perfect for a place to stay in Frankfurt before departing from the airport the next day. The staff is very efficient and everything runs smoothly. They even have a chart to determine what time you need to catch the shuttle for your flight. The shuttle run starts at six in the morning, but they will arrange for a taxi if you need to go earlier (approx. 20 e). The rooms are modern and clean and the free breakfast buffet is ample. My only complaint is that there is traffic noise if you have your window open, so ask for a room away from the street. Triple AAA rates made this a great value.

<Content>Great value for the money We stayed here for 1 night in November 2005. The hotel is located off of the highway. There is nothing around this propery. There are 2 resturants across the street, about a 1/2 mile or so away. The italian is a great place with excellent food, great local beer all at a great price. Sit out in the heated tent area if you are in a large group. The hotel was very clean when we checked in. I had a very fast check in. It offers a pay parking lot(8 euros a day). Very nice staff that speaks english. We stayed on the second floor in a nonsmoking room. Very clean. Small room that had a double bed and a fold out sofa. Modern decorations and satellite tv. It has a shower. The bathroom door also closes off the toilet area. Good water pressure. There is a hairdryer in the room. The lights only operate with the room key. You put it in a slot and all of the power comes on. When you remove it, all power goes out. The free breakfast was good. Breads, eggs, meats, juices, and coffee.They offer a shuttle to the airport for 5 euros per person. There is also a bar. Ice machine is down in the lobby.A great place to stay if you want to relax before traveling again.

<Content>Good, clean and quiet Good, clean and quiet. Great shower. However, if you don't have a car, you can't get anywhere. The hotel has a shuttle to and from the airport, but there is much around. Not near Frankfurt city, can't walk. There is a nice German restaurant and Italian restaurant across the road. Would recommend this hotel. Breakfast is included.
