<Content>Very good hotel Very good modern room, large (by Barcelona standards) and clean, free internet, nice shower, excellent staff (friendly and knowledgeable), this hotel is recommended. The location is not very central but if you don't mind walking to the Diagonal station approx. 10 minutes, you can get anywhere. The Diagonal being one of the busiest strees in Barcelona, the noise from outside is quite bad but the double-pane windows help keeping it to acceptable levels. Very convenient to get to the airport (approx. 20 euro depending on the traffic). Close by is a buffet restaurant called Moncho with touristic prices for a eat-as-much-as-you -ike decent food (although there are many better choices in Barcelona if you are not starving or love buffets especially). Was just annoyed that they overcharged one water, but that was not a big deal.

<Content>Very nice hotel As I already mentioned in the title, a very nice hotel (****).Staff was correct, friendly and helpfull.Reception, elevators, corridors, restaurant... and the room were very clean.The room was not very big, but was very ok, stylisch, 'open' bathroom, very good shower and cleaned (daily of course) very good. A nice kingsize bed (as we asked for). The room was not located near the street (as we asked for), because we were very afraid of outside-noise. During the first night we were awake a few times because of the neighbours coming in late and leaving early and 'doing something' in between (there are always people who really think they're the only guests in a hotel !).Breakfast was outstanding (only had better once before!).The hotel is located along a busy street, an avenue, with a lot of palm trees (nice), just outside the touristic area, lots of bars, resto's, caf茅s ... between the Catalonian people. Closest 'metro' stations are Diagonal and Hospital Clinic, both 10-15min walk. Once you're on the 'metro' it will bring you everywhere (in Barcelona ;-).If I have the opportunity to go again, I will stay there again.

<Content>Que encantada! I was only looking for a hotel that wasn't too far away from the University of Barcelona (half an hour walk) at a good price. I wasn't expecting a lovely hotel, but it was! My room was huge, the staff at the hotel was incredibly helpful, the neighborhood was nice and I couldn't be happier. It's a bit of a distance from the center of town - but that actually made me happier.

<Content>Clean, stylish rooms, modern, good location for exploring the city Found this special offer of 3nights for the price of 2nights during our stay in August 2008, excellent value for the quality provided. Although predominently a business hotel well situated in a quiet area on Diagonal Ave in central Barcelona. Just a couple of blocks from the nearest metro, within 20mins walk of Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas. Whilst we loved the buzz of Las Ramblas we were very pleased not to be staying in a hotel in the middle of all the bustle. The rooms are modern and very well appointed, with efficient friendly service. Did not eat at the hotel as there are several tapas bars, cafes etc within easy reach of the hotel. Would recommend, especially if there are deals available.

<Content>NIce hotel Recently spent three nights in the Hesperia Presidente. It is very nice and modern. Our room was quite big and absolutely spotless. Room service were very friendly and helpful. The bathroom was a bit strange. The shower is partly visible from the room as only some of the glass is frosted - worth knowing in advance if you are travelling with a friend or colleague. Also the toilet door doesn't shut and lock - you just push it closed as it is a big sheet of frosted glass though it is private unlike the shower! It is a bit away from the main tourist attractions so if you want to stay in the heart of Barcelona this is not the place for you. Having said that, it is very good value for a 4* hotel and is only about 15 minute walk from Las Ramblas etc.

<Content>Good all round choice All round good city break hotel.Don't expect any Spanish flavours in the interior....quite plush for for the cost per night, and looks newly refurbed throughout.About 10-15min reasonably paced walk to the Old Town and The Ramblas. About 20-25mins to the beach/marina. However it should only cost about 鈧?0 in a taxi.If possible request one of the top floors facing towards the Med, as will give a good view.Gym only had only 3-4 machines in it, and there isn't a pool. There is a small sun terrace...but if this is what you are after, you are much better off getting a hotel near the beach.

<Content>Truly 4 star. More suitable for business/short stay than for families/honeymoon! The room is very clean and modern. Spacious. Excellent shower with 3 types of jets . Good breakfast with plenty of fresh fruits. Easy access to the shopping district and the port. However:- Hard bed. No proper duvet available.  A small amount of water drips out from the shower room. It seems that you can never close the shower door completely.- The soap is very dry for the skin.- No skin moisturier available. - No iron available in room. - WATCH OUT FOR THE BIG MIRROR behing the bed. I bang my head on the first night. It's a very dangerous design- Not all staff speak english - No do not disturb sign- Service is a bit slow in the breakfast loungeI will come back I think.

<Content>Good Business Hotel Spent two nights at the Presidente on business.This is a modern, high-rise hotel in the prime business area of Barcelona, and as such is very well situated.The hotel appears to have been recently refurbished, with stone tile floors and limestone clad walls.Check-in was very quick and efficient, and staff very friendly indeed. Bedroom was high quality, with an enormous, king-size bed and quality furniture. The air-con fan was working, but not pumping cooled air, so the room was consequently a bit stuffy. The bathroom had high quality toiletries and plenty of towels. There was a separate shower 鈥?no bathtub, but the best, most powerful shower I have ever experienced.Breakfast was very good, and plentiful.The hotel was exceptionally clean and housekeeping excellent.This is a very good business hotel and I recommend it very highly.

<Content>OK for a short stay! I stayed for one night at the Hesperia Presidente and was given a double room. The hotel is modern and clean but a wee bit away from the tourist attractions. The rooms are adequate but the bath is tiny. My room had a small balcony but not all rooms have this so make sure you ask for one if you want it. It is not exactly luxurious but ok for one night. The only thing that slightly irked me was the bar closing at 1am even to residents. Considering most Catalans don't even consider going out until about 10pm, I found this surprising. My best Barcelona tip is head to the old Marina and jump onto th old fashioned boat/restaurant that is moored there for some lunchtime tapas. Enjoy the food and people watch all afternoon!

<Content>What a great hotel! I loved the modern, contemporary decor of the hotel....especially the bathrooms---I loved the large stand-in shower with the large shower head (great water pressure!) and massage jets....very relaxing after a long day of sightseeing!...I also loved the ultra-comfy king bed.I was even impressed by the complementary toiletries that the hotel provided, which even included: a hairbrush, shoeshine, razor, toothbrush, toothpaste etc...The hotel was a little far from the action in Barcelona, but I didn't mind; the hotel location was in an upscale neighboorhood on a nice, tree-lined street, and is close to transit. I would definately stay here again if I return to Barcelona!

<Content>Great Hotel with Great Service Have just returned from a 4 night stay in this extremely comfortable and well-run hotel. Although the rooms were not large, they had everything you could require for a relaxing stay.The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant and language was not a barrier. We particularly liked the comfortable bar and lounge area with it's very attentive staff.The location of the hotel was very convenient, with metro stations within a reasonable walking distance. If you don't mind a longer walk, many attractions were within easy reach on foot.If booking this hotel, we would strongly advise that you request a room on a high floor, as the views across the city are wonderful, and there is no problem with noise from the busy road. Another tip is to cross the Diagonal to a small cafe named TEO for breakfast. Their charges are very good and offer a great breakfast at a 1/3 price of the hotel's one. TEO offers an excellent range of value for money food with good and efficient service and will prepare your breakfast irrespective of whether it appears on their menu or not.

<Content>Great Place to Stay A classy hotel with spacious rooms. Modern, clean and comfortable. Good beds and pillows. Very friendly staff, good English. Great showers with 3 setings (normal overhead, wall jets and hand spray). Quiet neighborhood with good restaurants nearby. Negatives: no subway station nearby, the hotel breakfast only offers a buffet at 17 euros per person, and one of our group rooms had a bathroom with a see-through (opaque) window into the shower.

<Content>Lovely Hotel for a City Break My friend and I have just returned from a wonderful weekend in Barcelona. The hotel is exceptionally clean, modern and spacious. (The room we were in which was a standard one  was very big). The shower is great along with the lovely comfy matress!I did notice that there is a little bit of a language barrier in Barcelona  also in this hotel. The concierge's english was fairly poor.The only let down was that the mini-bar wasn't reguarlary stocked  the hotel bar is always empty, but you are in Barcelona and there's millions of bars and supermarkets everywhere!!I would definitely reccomend this hotel if you are wanting a city break with a nice affordable hotel which is close to the centre. It's on the Avenida Diagonal which is a nice area, you are also very close to the Avenida Gracia which is the Barcelona version of Bond Street.Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Decent hotel but could have been better Given the great reviews the hotel has got by previous guests, I was expecting to be wowed by the Hesperia Presidente but there were a few niggling issues that made my 4 night stay there just average.Firstly, when booking directly with the hotel, the reservations lady was very reluctant to send me email confirmation and didn't ask for a credit card number to guarantee the booking. I booked at very short notice (the night before my arrival) so really wanted something from the hotel in writing before I left the UK. I never got my email but I did eventually (after 3 calls to chase it up) get a reservation number. The room was fine, perfectly adequate, if a little small. It was generally clean, apart from a few hairs on the bathroom floor and a rather fusty smell in the toilet cubicle. Although it was a non-smoking room, I have a sneaking suspicion that it had been occupied by smokers quite recently. On the plus side, the bed (or should I say beds - two large singles pushed together) were really comfortable and ensured a very good night's sleep.The staff was pleasant enough, although not overly welcoming.The bar is nicely laid out, although for 2 nights running we were the only 2 people in it.One thing that I did think was very cheeky was the fact that, despite offering 2 computers for guests' use in the business centre, I was asked to pay 鈧? for half an hour's usage. This should be free of charge.The location of the hotel is very practical and there are several decent eateries close by. There is a Starbucks just around the corner (not that you necessarily go to Barcelona to go to Starbucks, but it is a quick and easy breakfast option...) and in the basement of the nearly El Corte Ingles is a well-stocked supermarket. We went to a restaurant called Daps which was good value, served tasty food and had a lively atmosphere (just opposite El Corte Ingles). All in all, the hotel provided us with a good base to explore Barcelona. It could have been better but in general it was perfectly satisfactory.

<Content>Comfortable, quality, location Great room, big comfy bed, modern bath. Shower door is glass and shower head offers 3 different spray types/locations including the large overhead round one. Size of room is good and sufficient but not spacious; view from 10th floor was great (Av Diagonal).  The location was quite good for business as it is central and close to many shops, restaurants but the metro is about 10 min by foot. The property is majestic as it sits on a corner near the financial district with many cafes nearby. Breakfast was really very good on quality/variety. The lounge is adjacent to the restaurant so I moved over to read the paper on a Saturday morn to relax on the couches nearby. The young porter was so helpful on many fronts during my stay. Front desk was professional but not offering any personal warmth or charm (too bus y of a hotel for that). Really enjoyed everything and would go back.

<Content>A little bit of luxury! Booked this hotel through the Hesperia website for our wedding anniversary in May 2007. We checked in late at night but unfortunately got a room on the 4th floor so the traffic noise was a bit of a problem at night - try and get a high floor! Room was lovely, bed comfortable and we too can recommend the shower facilities! (although I do always miss a bath when there isn't one!). Can't comment on the breakfast, at 17 euro's it was just too expensive and we took the easy option in the morning, turning right and walking up the road to Starbucks! If you turn left out of the hotel and walk up towards the big roundabout, there's a supermarket in the lower ground floor of El Cortes Ingles and the tourist bus stops for the red and blue lines (be warned though, the queue outside Starbucks for the blue line is usually really long!). Was a good place to stay in the city, don't think I would have wanted to stay in the Old Town. Next time I think I would stay at Port Olympic as it's a good place to spend the evenings!

<Content>Lovely hotel I would definately recommend this hotel. We stayed in a double room which was very large, with a super king size bed, 2x couches, flat screen tv, mini bar and massive power shower with jet sprays. Room service is excellent and the maids do an excellent job each day. Reception are very helpful. We changed rooms mid way through our stay because we could hear a baby crying in the room next to us - so not sure if the rooms have great sound proofing or this was a very noisy baby! We didn't hear any other noises. Location wise, the hotel is located on the corner of a busy road, but we didn't have any problems with road noise though. It isn't right in the middle of town, but there are lots of nearby restaurants to eat in, and you can either walk to Las Ramblas in 20-25 mins, or grab a cab (lots of them) for less than 鈧?; you can walk to The Sagrada Familia in 20 minutes. I would definately recommend taking the Tourist Bus which does 3 routes (Red, Green and Blue) and you can jump on and off as many times are you like (~鈧?0 for 1 day).One restaurant I would 100% NOT recommend is the Les Quinze Nits located in La Ramblas. It is by far the worst restaurant I have even been to with regards to incredibly terrible food and service. It seems to have lots of good reviews online - but don't fall into the trap of believing them!

<Content>Excellent hotel with perfect location My husband and I stayed at this hotel for both pleasure and business. The rooms are modern and spotless. The view from our room was beautiful and overlooked the entire city down to the ocean (12th floors). The shower is by far one of the best showers, it resembles the showers at most american spas and has high pressure. They have a gym on site and have massage services available. They also have free internet access all throughout the hotel. The staff has got to be the most friendly staff I have ever encountered during my travels. The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to all local attractions. It sits away from all the chaos and madness. If you do not like to walk everything is less than 5 euros away with a cab. The metro station is right outside of the hotel. The breakfast is awesome and room service ( try the hamburger and espresso) is just amazing. The only thing I would suggest is not to make any international phone call from the room. Either than that this would be my second choice while staying in Barcelona. My first would be the majestic hotel; however, there was no room at the time we attempted to book our stay.

<Content>You will not be disappointed We stayed at this lovely hotel for three nights in December 2006. We booked via Lastminute.com and paid just 拢225 for the three nights B+B which we thought was very good value. Had seen it at twice that price on some websites so it pays to shop around. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The rooms were excellent with brilliant showers and amenities - the only thing I missed were tea and coffee making facilities. The rooms were exceptionally warm - I had to turn the heating off completely. If I had to take issue with anything it would be the cooked breakfast - it was cold. Despite this the selection for breakfast was oustanding and everyone should be able to find something to their taste. Had the breakfast been hot I would have given this hotel the full Excellent rating. Breakfast was served between 0700 and 1100 giving us the opportunity of a lie-in after hours of shopping. The area the hotel is in is commercial and on a busy road although we had no problems with noise as we were on the 7th floor overlooking a side street. The hotel has a pillow menu if you require different pillows, unfortunately the pillows we requested were not available. If, as we did, you have a hire car there is plenty of parking nearby in underground parking lots at a cost of around 2 euros per hour or leave it all day (24hrs) for 24 euros and use the good transportation options available. There are trams, taxis, buses and metro in abundance. We found the underground metro very useful and cheap 5 euros each to travel as much as you wanted all day. Just be careful of pickpockets as my wife had her wallet taken from her handbag and we were aware of the problems before we went and still became victims. Local police were very helpful in filing a crime report for us and very apologetic. The pickpockets appear to be Eastern European and definately not Spanish. Do not let this put you off as we had a really good time in Barcelona and will be going back and very likely staying in the same hotel.

I loved it and was very impressed from the minute the taxi pulled up outside. It is very clean and very modern. The hotel staff were very helpful and took our bags up to our room in 904. The rooms are exactly how they look in the photos. The bathroom doors are all frosted glass and the shower is huge with 6 jets! If you want to get to the centre and to Les Ramblas then it is about a 20 minute walk but if you get a ticket for the tourbus then you can jump on it to get back to the hotel as it stops just up the road.

<Content>Really great hotel, but not for you if you want to be close to the metro I really liked the Esperia Presidente. I was in town for a friend's birthday, and I thought the location was great for going out to clubs and bars--if you're walking or taking a taxi. The lobby is very clean and neat and the front desk staff were really friendly--although English levels differed. My room was on the 14th floor and was very modern and bright. Great beds, linens, pillows. Flat screen tv. Mini bar--no wine though. Awesome shower--could fit at least two. :) Nice writing desk. I though thte bar area was particularly pleasant and inviting. It's spread across the front corner of the building with good views onto Ave Diagonal. It would be a great place to meet up with friends and hold informal business meetings. Also, wine was only about 2 euros a glass, which is fantastic! (Love Spanish prices!)I paid 15 euros for the breakfast and it was great. You name it, they had it. Awesome ham and tortillas (the spanish kind), plus the normal breakfast stuff. And it went on until 11!Location-wise, you're not close to the Metro. You are about a 15 minute walk to Plaza de Gracia and all the shopping. The open-topped tour bus stops down the road, about a 7 minute walk. I was actually in Barcelona for fun, but if I have to come back for business, I would definitely stay here again as I found it to be a great business-class hotel. When I went to leave, I mentioned I needed a taxi and the doorman practically prostrated himself in traffic to get me one. If you're looking for recs on bars/clubs--I liked Hotel Omm upstairs--very trendy and great Scandinavian furniture/design on the ground floor. The dance club downstairs was ok. I LOVED Elephant--outdoors with cool loungey cushions/beds scattered about.
