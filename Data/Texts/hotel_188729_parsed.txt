<Content>Stellar Hotel Le Bristol Paris is an elegant hotel with great service. I got early check-in, room upgrade and a bottle of Sancerre Grand Cuvee packed in a wooden box with a greeting card from the hotel's manager. Everybody in the hotel was very helpful and accommodating. Hotel has a very special, homelike atmosphere.Room was spacious, clean and quiet. Luxury toiletries (Hermes, Anne Semonin), prompt room service, excellent breakfast buffet (included in room price), one of the best dinners I've ever had (Restaurant Le Bristol deserves 3 Michelin stars instead of 2 which it currently holds). Nice pool and a small gym in the 6th floor where you can see the rooftops of Parisian houses.Hotel is pricey but worth every euro. Highly recommended.

<Content>Grand Dame of Paris This review will reflect the service offered when staying in the Presidential Suite ...and of course as with any hotel if you stay in the biggest suites, they really look after you. Booked for extended family of 8. Presidential Suite is enormous although 1 half (bedroom  lounge) dont really 'match' the other half (bedroom  lounge/dining). The styles are quite different. In general the hotel is quite mumsy (flowery, old fashioned). The bathrooms though are def. not up to the standard - nice, clean but old and not 5 star  certainly not for a presidential suite. Bathrooms were the same in a deluxe junior suite  deluxe room. Bit strange? Service was good although the hotel knew our arrival time  we still arrived to a dark suite, no lights on, no flowers etc. Also work is on going at the hotel as they expand into a neighbouring building. This at times affects ones stay including dirty corridors  workmen cabling in the passages etc. Breakfast is superb! Absolutely perfect. Room service too is very good. The pool is a delight at the end of a long shopping day. Location too is very good.

<Content>Elegant and beautiful Parisian hotel My husband and I have been to Paris a few times; this was our third trip. We have stayed at the Ritz (wonderful location and beautiful hotel, but it needs some serious TLC), the George V (amazing in every way, by far the best hotel in Paris, but be prepared to empty your savings in order to pay for it) and the Bristol. Of the three hotels, Bristol is the property to which we will return. Yes, it is quite pricey, but at the 5 star level it is actually priced on the lower end of the spectrum. The lobby is beautiful, rooms are elegantly appointed and generously sized. Concierge was friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the garden restaurant is lovely and tranquil. The hotel is located on Rue St. Honore, which is home to nearly every designer store you can imagine....Hermes (flagship store is multi-leveled), Lanvin, Dior, etc, etc, etc. All major attractions (Louvre, Tuilleries, Champs-Elysees, Arc de Triomphe, etc) are within walking distance. A note about Paris...it is THE quintessential walking city. Please do not take cabs, unless your destination is quite far. Paris is a lovely city and best experienced on foot. Overall, the Bristol is an elegant luxury hotel that stands out amongst its competitors.

<Content>Le Bristol, elegant and discreet Hotel Le Bristol has been a favorite for many years. On my visit to Paris last summer I stayed at Four Seasons George V, based upon the many stellar reviews on this sight (and I love FS Hotels in general); the FS George V was flawless in many ways and exciting and beautiful and the staff were positively friendly beyond being professional and efficient.The Bristol, however, is an elegant hotel which is unique. It is not so flashy, but entirely beautiful. It's location is superb because it bridges the neighborhoods where the George V (Camps Elysees) is and the neighborhoods in the opposite direction (Louvre, Opera, Tuilleries). Also, its a quicker walk to the Left Bank.The George V may have a flashier lobby and more interesting and attractive venues for eating/driniking but the Bristol has the most beautiful Parisian Park and Gardens as the centerpiece of its public areas. The buldings which surround the gardens comprise the rooms in the hotel and the garden is a fabulously beautiful spot for dinner, breakfast or a drink.The lobby is understated and in all honesty could use some new soft furnishings. The structure and architecture itself is faultless.But the service. It is truly personal, elegant and very discreet. The hotel is not on a huge square or major avenue although the Faubourg St, Honore is a street which is renowned for its fabulous shops. It is also very close to the Palace d'Elysees and everything that is beautiful about Paris.The room we received was lovely. Freshly renovated, the style would disappoint some who like a more overtly opulent style or, who, on the other side of the spectrum love cutting-edge modern. The Bristol room was elegant, yet restrained. The bathroom is all marble and huge...the biggest bathtub I can recall....you need not spend your money on a spa treatment once you soak in the beautiful tub infused with the special bath products provided which come their own exclusive spa.We had a junior suite (mind you, not a deluxe junior suite and we could not stop taking joy in the beauty of the room.) We also had two huge, flower-bedecked, windows which opened onto the magnificent Garden. The soft sounds of the fountain were sooothing...and the beautiful view was pure indulgence.Everytime I have stayed at the Bristol, the service has been impeccable. I am always recognized, even after an absence of a few years. I am know by name before I even reach the reception desk (and not because some driver or staff member calls ahead on his discreet walkie-talkie.)Don't get me wrong, the service at the George V FS was great in the wonderful FS style, but Le Bristol is truly old-school. It is perfect in the way great European hotels have always been perfect. Of course, there was a huge bouquet of roses and lilies in the room, perfectly matched to the color scheme of the decor; of course there was a large pedalstal of fresh fruits, and a large platter of petit fours for our enjoyment. These are not just amenities...this is the Bristol style. And this is the manner in which the Bristol thanks its loyal customers for returning over the years.The breakfasts are delicious...the buffet in the summer garden restaurant or room service...the best baguettes, croissants, coffee, hot chocolat, etc.Elegant, perfect service and discreet are the words I keep coming back to in order to describe Le Bristol. Not as haughty as the Plaza Athenee, not as busy/glitzy and as American as the Four Seasons George ; I enjoy the neighborhood of the Bristol better because it is less hectic neighborhood than the Meurice or Crillion (although the latter is located on the most beautiful Place on earth. and the former faces the Louvre and the Jardin de Tuilleries)I will go back to the George V again because the public spaces and restaurants are impossibly beautiful and the hotel is abuzz with excitement. The rooms are excellent too. But for classic French style and service, when I am in the mood for that, I will stay at Hotel Le Bristol.Of course, one cannot go wrong in Paris with the small hotels de charme which dot the right and left banks these days. But if service is important, and extra space and unique elegance are appreciated the extremely high price of the Bristol is an excellent choice.

<Content>Perfection I am in the hospitality industry and run a luxury hotel company. I recently stayed in Paris for a very special occasion. Without hesitation I chose Le Bristol as its reputation amongst professionals is legendary. I was not disappointed and can even say my expectations were totally exceeded. The staff is absolutely perfect, kind and attentive without the robotic attitude found in other luxury hotels, warm without being familiar . The rooms were just what one would expect of such a place, traditional, exuding old charm but extremely comfortable and grand. We had a suite and my partner just loved it, chintz and opulent french style furniture but with plasma screens in both the lounge and the bedroom and a remarkable small business center. We are both foodies and had reservations in some special places in Paris (Jules Vernes, Robuchon, Lipp) so we only experienced room service but it was perfect, the best onion soup ever and service was extremely fast. We are looking forward to our next stay so we can experience the restaurant.The gardens, the largest in Paris for a hotel, are magic and a great place to have breakfast or lunch and the pool and little tanning terrace are adorable.But what really made the difference were all the delicate and touching attentions.If you are celebrating with a loved one, do not hesitate and book yourself into Le Bristol.I must finish by congratulating the whole team and thanking them for making a special stay so memorable... and I am a very fussy guest :)

<Content>Traditional and reliably good Most traditional and discreet of the Parisian palace hotels. Several wings around a large inner garden. Superb service. Ground floor has recently been gently redecorated.Large room with traditional decoration (chintz, French antiques, crystal chandeliers, old prints), some of which is a litlle dated. Large and very comfortablre bathroom with Herm猫s and Anne S茅monin toiletries. Again, some of the decoration should be gently brought up to date.The fitness room has recently been expanded and modernised and, unlike in most hotels, it is not in the basement or on the last floor but on a premium floor with plenty of direct light. The swimming pool is stunning and gives you the illusion of swimming on a ship sailing at some distance from Cap d'Antibes and the Bristol's sister hotel Cap Eden Roc. The food is very good (and expensive). My favourites are breakfast in the summer restaurant (fresh pineapple juice and a great buffet) and tea and pastries in the garden. The Bristol has the best tea service I have ever seen: teas are all loose leaf and infused properly (adapted to each tea) before being poured from a porcelain teapot.Not everything is perfect. In the room, the carpeting and the mini bar have seen better days, and the mattress (not of the quality expected) is two twins zipped together. Despite the high rates (600+ euro per night), the hotel charges for Internet access (21 euro per day or 5 euro per quarter hour), music (10 euro per CD) and films (20 euro per DVD). The construction next door (no nuisance) is for a new wing with rooms, suites and a more informal restaurant.

<Content>An experience to treasure We stayed in the Hotel Le Bristol last October during the Rugby World Cup 2007. The Le Bristol is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed. Its centrally located in the Saint-Honore area, close to all the fabulous fashion houses, museums and restaurants. The room was great, it was large and beautifully decorated. The gym and indoor pool were clean and beautifully located on the top floor. The staff were very friendly and the food from the restaurant was fantastic. We loved it and will go back again when we next visit Paris. We highly recommend you to experience the great services and ambience of Hotel Le Bristol.

<Content>Nice Hotel but Stayed at the Bristol for 3 nights in November. Picked this hotel because it was near my company's Paris office and we were having meetings there.The hotel is nice but not that nice for the price. My room was good sized but it looked out over a building being refurbished. The staff never contacted me to see if I was happy with my room. The buffet breakfast in the morning was just ok-for the price. I think it was $60 US.The work out room was lacking in equipment and space. The sauna area was closed and could not figure out how to get into the steam room. No staff there to help.Nice location but not worth the price. Save money and stay somwhere else.

<Content>Excellent but v expensive extras Just back from a 2 night stay at Le Bristol. excellent location, lovely hotel with good staff. Room and bathroom very spacious.My only gripe is the cost of the extras i.e. food and drink - way overpriced even for a hotel of this calibre (and I was travellling on business.) Also car from Gare Du Nord (20 minutes although can take longer) is Euro 185 if booked through hotel which I did due to possible transport strikes - a regular taxi is around Euro 15 max!

<Content>Le Bristol Paris - Tres Magnifique! Just finished a six-night stay at Le Bristol, Paris. I was traveling solo - and couldn't have picked a more perfect hotel or location!The property is simply elegant, with a gorgeous marble lobby and hotel lounge, and quiet rooms surrounding a beautifully serene garden courtyard. The service and staff were first-rate, the rooms very spacious - and the all-marble bathroom featured a huge soaking tub, French toiletries, and a heated towel rack!This place is expensive (I was in a deluxe room at 770 euros per night) - but completely worth it if you are looking for the ultimate Parisian stay. The location was perfect: a short walk to several metro stops (Champs d'Elysee, Frankline Roosevelt, or Miromesnil ). There is a Starbucks just 3 blocks walk and a delicious patisserie nearby where you can pick up a quick sandwichor pastry on your way out for the day. It's an easy walk to the Champs d'Elysee or Avenue Montaigne for luxury shopping (Chanel, Chloe, Dolce  Gabanna, etc.) It is also about 100 euros less per night than the George V or the Ritz. If you are looking for luxury in Paris - you can't do better! I give it 5 stars!

<Content>A beautiful hotel but... Our family spent two nights here before heading to the chateau country. We booked two connecting rooms under the family program which included buffet breakfast. The hotel lobby and rooms are indeed worthy of its deluxe rating. Our rooms were large, well appointed and spotless. We really wanted to like this hotel more but a few problems arose which prevented a perfect score. First we arrived after our overnight flight in the late morning and were told that our rooms were not ready. Ok, I can see that if the hotel was full that would be understandable- but it wasn't. They were kind enough to give us a standard room (One bed) to use until our rooms were ready. We were finally shown our rooms at 3 PM and by this time our children were exhausted. We had requested non smoking rooms but were given smoking. Well it was only for two nights and our children were in no mood to change rooms. We figured by using the air-conditioning we would at least be comfortable. The A.C. didn't work all that well and our rooms looked onto a small courtyard so there was no chance for fresh air. Needless to say we didn't sleep all that well. Breakfasts were good but not what I would expect from this type of establishment - the breakfasts at the Meurice were better. The final little miss was during lunch in the bar area. We ordered a rather simple lunch, salads, sandwitches etc. and they managed to mess up the order twice. The quality of the food was excellent though. Overall the staff were very polite and well trained and if it wasn't for these problems we would probably return- but Paris is full of other deluxe hotels -maybe we will try the Ritz next.

<Content>Le Bristol - Simply Outstanding We arrived at 'Le Bristol' on a beatiful April afternoon having driven all the way from our home in London. We were shown to our room immediately; we had been upgraded to a lovely suite and were pleased to find a beautiful cot bed and cuddly toy for our one year old daughter. Throughout our stay, the service was impeccable. The room service guys would tiptoe so as not to wake our baby while bringing us the delicious food we'd ordered. The swimming pool was an oasis of calm with great rooftop views of Paris and no age restrictions. Dinner at the 2-michelin starred restaurant was simply outstanding.This is one of few hotels in the world offering a 5* service wihout haughty attitude or stuffiness. Can't wait to go back!

<Content>Truly a five star experience We travel quite a bit, and usually as a family.Our annual August trip with our two children, ages 12  15, took us to Paris for four days and then on to Provence.I booked the Hotel Le Bristol, through the Leading Hotels of the World, but it was with all the excellent insights of TripAdvisor reviewers that helped me to make up my mind . So thanks to all of you!And the Bristol did not disappoint.  Of course we flew from the States, and , miracle!, our rooms were ready for us as soon as we got there, around 11 AM. Fantastic. And believe me, there are many 5 star hotels that have told us to come back at 4 PM, or ushered us to lounges until late afternoon. (Hotel Arts in Barcelona or The Carlton Towers in London are two that come to mind.).We didn't know that Leading Hotels had asked for an upgrade for us, which is standard operations for the company. We had booked a jr. suite and an adjoining room with two doubles for the kids . Well, the Bristol did upgrade us, ---- to a fabulous apartment! And no extra charge. The views were stellar. The service was quietly superb. Yes, the meals are expensive there. We prefered to go out into Paris for wonderful meals, be it just coffee and breads in the morning, or cafe lunches; or solid bistro meals. The Bristol staff understood what our family was looking for and recommended spot-on places. I really went back--forth about which Paris hotel to book . I am so glad we chose the Bristol. It was a worth the money and proved to be so memorable.Hope this helps.

<Content>expensive and worth it The Bristol is physically beautiful and very conveniently located for tourists (20 minutes walk from both the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre). The staff are professional and courteous to a degree not even approached at any of the other hotels at which I've stayed. The rooms are comfortable and spacious ... even in one of the cheapest rooms (the Superior room) there was lots of space along with a large stunningly-appointed bathroom. There's a lovely (indoor) swimming pool on the top floor with great views of Paris. My wife's birthday happened to fall on one of the days of our stay and the hotel (with no prompting, they must have gleaned our birthdays from our passports at check-in) had a delicious chocolate cake sent to our room.The hotel is expensive (our room ran to about 540 euro = $600+ per night), and the food is correspondingly expensive. You can expect to pay 18 euro ($20+) for a glass of ordinary whiskey at the bar, and about 45 euro ($50+) for a full (American) breakfast. You can avoid the food charges by breakfasting at the bakery two blocks down the street (3 or 4 euro for coffee and croissants), or drinking at any of the many bars in the area (6 euro or so for the same ordinary glass of whiskey).All in all it's a great place for a honeymoon or luxury vacation. You'll pay through the nose but you will get what you're paying for.

<Content>Great hotel I stayed at the Bristol in February. Damp and dreary Paris weather but pure luxury inside the hotel. Room was large and nicely furnished. Restaurant was great--among best recent meals in Paris and open on Sunday. Also, the Bristol has a nice selection of teas to relax after work in the afternoon. Surrounded by the best shopping and near the river for a nice jog.My only suggestion is flat screen TVs would be nice in a luxury hotel, which the Bristol more than meets the requirements.

<Content>Hotel Le Bristol is Pure Elegance We headed to Paris to watch Lance Armstrong win the Tour de France. Never having been to Paris, I had no expectation or prior experience on the hotels. We chose the Hotel Le Brisol, and it was absolutely one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in.Our room was not ready when we arrived and being jet lagged and tired, we waited in the lobby with books to pass the time. We were unexpectedly upgraded to a junior suite at no charge - I think they took pity on us because I'm sure we looked awfully tired! Our room was lovely with a balcony overlooking the gardens and the restaurant. We had a beautiful, marble bathroom with a separate shower room. Everything was absolutely lovely. This hotel is also within great walking distance to the Champs Elysees and many monuments. The concierge staff is impeccable and Sebastian went above and beyond to help us - at one point even bringing us AAA batteries for our digital camera. He was a highlight of our trip; what a wonderful concierge.

Our room over looked the beuatiful gardens. Our room and bathroom was HUGE. The food is a little expensive, even for Paris. Check the prices of the minibar. A coke was appx $8.00.The staff is very friendly and helpful. For a Palace Hotel, no one was arrogant.Every area was extremely clean. I highly recommend this hotel for travelers going to Paris for sightseeing, restaurants and shopping. Like they say, Location, Location, Location.
