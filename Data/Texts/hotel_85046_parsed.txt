<Content>Good but Different Stay My wife and I were in Miami for personal business and booked the Double Tree because it was it great rate on Hilton's website. When we arrived I asked if an upgrade was available, and received a 1 bedroom suite in the residential condo building. Lots of space, great view! The suite was obviously someone's 1 bedroom condo as the furnishings were unusual; and the tv was hard to figure out, but this was more than made up for by the size and comfort. Check in staff were very helpful, and when we needed help with the tv it came quickly. The hotel is connected to a shopping arcade with an interesting collection of shops  a few restaurants. One of the restaurants acts as the hotel's breakfast restaurant. Overall, it was certainly not what we expected and might not be for everyone (ie. if you are used to a standard business hotel), but was very enjoyable.

<Content>Okay Stay with Some Minor Problems The Doubletree Biscayne Bay is convenintely located off of Route 1 (Biscayne Blvd.) It is basically connected to the Marriott Biscayne Bay.The hotel is not just a hotel but a big residental skyrise.It seems that every person that lives here has a dog or two, so there are always dog walking around the lobby and restaurant areas. I even noticed an owner walking the dog out the back lobby and the dog was peeing on the building. Upon arriving at the hotel, my reservation was for a King Bay View Room with a balcony, upon checking in i was given a Standard King with a supposed no balcony.I inquired about why this was (even with my Diamond Status, i was bumped per say from my room that i had made a reservation for and was merely told that we were sold out this weekend)Upon arriving at Room 949, my room did have a balcony, though stating on the sliding door For your safety and security this door will not open All i had to do was pull the lock up and bam the door slid open and i had access to a balcony.Though the balcony was shared with three other rooms next to me and there were no dividers (beware)Breakfast coupons were given to me and were good for (up to $8) which i used each morning at the deli for eggs and bacon or french toast.Great views and lots of places to walk around and exercise.I did use the 10th floor pool, this pool was heated and between (85 to 90 degrees) very comfortable no matter what time of day or wind condition. Very clean area and not busy during the times that i went.The hotub is a big hottub with 4 coves (if you will) that allow you to mix and mingle if you wish.Cesar (Head Concierge) was great during my whole stay.Cons:Housekeeping was awful (one day i got no towels, one day i got one towel and the other day i got two towels)One of the days i left the room at 8am to go to my conference upon returing around 3:30 p.m. the room had still not been touched as was never done during the whole day.Front staff was medicore at best, though the hotel was fully booked for Nascar and various other events.The hotel was not apologetic with the room mixup and was blaming the Diamond Desk for a rate code problem.If i did return i would stay in one of the condos not in the hotel part.Valet parking was a joke, $29 dollars a day (though you do have in and out privilages)

<Content>Convenient Location and Valet Service This is not a luxury hotel, but it is conveniently located 2 blocks from the Venetian Causeway that takes you over to South Beach and 5 minutes from downtown Miami and the major freeways. Rooms were comfortable, spacious and quiet. Hotel is right on the bay. Pool and hot tub area above average, but not over the top. The downside is that the Doubletree merely leases a few floors from The Grand condominium, so you are staying in a mixed use building with a lot of hotel and condominium traffic. Valet service took great care of our vehicle during our 4-night stay at $1 tip each time we picked up and dropped off our vehicle. Great for families and visitors to Miami.

<Content>Double Tree Not so Grand Stayed one night.Upon entrance of the hotel, it is beautiful inside, the lobby that is. Staff are okay. The concerge desk is unfriendly and rude when asked time taken on the way back to get to airport via taxi. Very standoffish. I stayed in the 1 bedroom condo. Upon 'glance' appearance, it is very nice looking. Many spots on the ceiling from water damage and oil spots. Bed was comfortable. Shower disguistingly dirty with mold apparent. Soaker tub was not clean as hairs found. I was woken up via phone by the housekeeping staff asking what time I would be checking out. Then an hour later the staff knocked on the door and asked again when I would be checking out. Quite the disturbance. The pool is dirty with brown stains on the bottom. I would not walk about bare foot around the pool as it also looked unkempt. This hotel is a sad attempt at renovating a very old building.I would rather pay the same expensive rate and get my moneys worth elsewhere.

<Content>Having to switch rooms in the middle of the night is never good I was booked at the Doubletree Grand Hotel Biscayne Bay for a business trip to Miami. Here's the lowdow:The Upside:Sunny pool with enough space to accomodate a crowd.Quick drive across the bay to South Beach.Doubletree cookies at check in.Le Faubourg Deli downstairs has a great selection .Bay view is great.Walking distance to two other big hotels, shops, restaurants.The Downside:The non-smoking rooms on the 6th floor still reek of smoke.The rooms need to be rescued from the 1980's.The closet had a leak from the bathroom.THE SHEETS WERE DIRTY.The reception area is too small for a hotel that size.The balcony on the 6th and 9th floor cannot be accessed.The no-pets policy had recently been implemented because of a problem with fleas. This hotel is in need of an overhaul. I moved rooms in the middle of the night because I discovered that the sheets weren't clean when I finally made it to bed after a long work day. The manager came up to the 6th floor with keys to a suite (non-smoking) that still reeked of smoke. I was then given a suite on the 9th floor with a great bay view but because of insurance limitations, the balcony's sliding doors could not be opened. I would wait until the hotel is renovated before booking here.

<Content>No Customer Service, No Caring, No Management We had a miserable experience there. Arrived at 2pm, told our room was not ready. No problem, check in is at 3pm. Went downtown for some site seeing and snacks. Came back to hotel at 4:30, where they told us a college football team had not left their rooms yet, and we could not check in. After constant checking, didn't get a room until 7pm, and settled for something other than what we had reserved.Asked to have luggage brought up. Waited another hour, no luggage. Finally went downstairs to bellmans closet, and hauled my own luggage upstairs.At 9am the next morning, housekeeping knocked at the door, asking to clean the room. More insult to injury.This was a nightmare from the start. Many other guests had similar issues. Management was nowhere to be found, and a complaint letter to the hotel was never answered. I would recommend avoiding this hotel in the future.

<Content>Planning my next visit! This hotel makes my top ten list...easy! Wonderful ammenities, professional and non-evasive staff, beautiful  spacious rooms and much more. If you have the extra funds, upgrade to a jr. suite. It's so worth it! I actually had a partial view of the Bay, but it was still beautiful and I loved every bit of it! I had my heart set on staying in South Beach, but I had a budget and really couldn't take the risk of staying in a jacked up hotel in my efforts of saving a few bucks and being on the beach. I'm so happy I choose the Doubletree...you just can't go wrong! It took me less than 10 minutes to get to South Beach and less than 5 to get to Downtown clubs and restuarants. Now for the drawbacks- the daily valet fee is expensive. Be prepared for this because there is no airport shuttle and you'll probably need a car to get to South Beach. No free continental breakfast...but if you need a good cheap breakfast, there's a Denny's about 5 minutes away...shhh. lolThe bar downstairs was really cool...get the mojito! In a nutshell, I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone. If you're a little leary of some of the hotels on the beach, stay here and soak up the essence of Miami. I felt like I was staying in a condo, versus a hotel. I can't wait to visit again!

<Content>Lovely hotel, great pool! Lovely hotel, bottom 9 or so floors are hotel, upper floors are condo dwellers. The pool was the highlight for me, big enough for lap swimming! on a rooftop, with a view to the bay. The OMNI is close by ( couple block walk) hop on that for free, get off at Freedom Tower Station and you're only a couple blocks from the Bayside Marketplace. Lovely hotel room with a great view of Biscayne Bay, nice living room, separate bedroom area...very nice.

The services, decor, furnishings, cleanliness and staff were above our expectations. This is a top notch hotel We would definitely stay here again. My husband thought it was super also. View was beautiful. The only negative comment we have is that they charge for a one hour late check out. I give it a 5 for fantastic!Lisa from Georgia

<Content>Be fussy when booking the condos Encouraged by the reviews on this site we booked a condo at the last minute with this hotel. From the start everything seemed to go wrong.Initiatly we were shown to a lovely condo - sadly it had the wrong number of beds so we had to move. It took well over an hour for this move to be organised - we now suspect that this was because they were trying to knock an unused room into shape.The room we finally received was poorly maintained - cupboards had broken lamps hidden in them, fittings were missing from walls, the laminate floor had chips missing from them, the windows showed signs of damp penetration and there were broken chairs on the terrace. Bedroom doors didn't shut (nor did the blinds) and the single beds (which we didn't want) were actually broken. The cleaning wasn't much better - the last occupant clearly had long black hair - it was all over the shower and the wash basins. The surfaces were covered in dust and many of the sufaces in the kitchenette were soiled. The floor clearly hadn't been swept for some time.Complaining took considerable effort - the Condo manager went out of her way to avoid us and only spoke when we insisted on seeing her. She promised to attend to all the cleaning issues and mentioned that they were planning not to let the apartment again (you can imagine how good that made us feel). She made a vague offer to move our apartments which we didn't take up as were were going out for the day and were only staying a second night.When we returned the condo showed little sign of cleaning (apart from left over containers). When we complained again and asked to see the manager we had a delegation of four staff (including the condo manager) who tried to tell us that we'd been offered a specific ocean-view apartment when we'd coplained earlier.The outcome was that that they waived the costs of one of our two nights stay and gave us free breakfast.If you are considering this hotel be aware that the condos are in a separate area and you should be ready to insist on getting a good room - the condos are not owned by the hotel but sub-let from individual owners. These owners maintain their condos to different standards so be ready to ask for a better room if you don't like the one you are given.

<Content>My stay was horrible I booked my reservation 10 months in advance requesting a Double Non Smoking, but when I checked in I received a King bed. The staff argued with me for 1/2 an hour and finally decided to offer me a $10 breakfast voucher.They did switch me to 2 beds for the remaining of my stay (4 nights). The Conciegre(Ladies) were very rude and did'nt want to be bothered with any questions. Their facial expressions were nasty as you approched the desk. There was a plumbing problem in the bathroom. The Engineer can to fix it and used all of our towels,he stated he'll bring us towels, but we never saw him again. I did receive a call from him asking was everything fine, but still had o request towels from housekeeping. There is no Balcony to these rooms that you can go out and sit. You can only look out the window. You can not open the glass doors. There were Piegons having relations and making noises all during the morning.The valet staff were terrible. There were 2 stolen cars during my stay and they were not knowlegable of who checked what car in. I will never stay at this hotel again in my life. I will suggest the Marriott Biscayne Bay. It is Great !!

<Content>Good hotel. Not great. Stayed at the hotel on business for 3 nights. I booked via hilton.com and asked for an upper level room with a view of the bay. I was impressed that they gave me a room on the end facing the bay and was on the top floor. Great location!The hotel itself is a little run down as seems to be everything in Miami. The room was decent and pretty clean but not excellent. I felt that the housekeeping staff was somewhat below average. They never replaced all of my towels and I kept finding nasty long curly black hairs after they cleaned. They never got cleaned up. My other complaint is about the valet. Not only is it expensive at $29 per day but the attendants seemed a little sleazy. The hotel shares the building with what I presume are condos. The valet people seem to be indifferent to hotel patrons. The first time I left a few quarters in the drink holder. When I got the car back some of them were missing. I thought that was crappy so I made sure I didn't leave anything of value in the car after that.Good things: the bed was clean and comfortable. The front desk was very friendly and I always got my wakeup call on time. I would give it a 3 out of 5.

<Content>Nice Hotel But Beware of Valet Stayed at this hotel for a wedding and found the hotel to be quite nice. The rooms seemed to be recently remodeled and the staff was nice. The parking was only valet service and a bit expensive. Beware! Do not leave anything in the cars because we had some change from the tolls taken. The pool area was a nice place to relax, and there were several restaurant options in the same building. Overall, a nice stay with the exception of the trouble with the valet.

<Content>A jewel to be discovered Our recent stay at this hotel can only be described as great...the efficient staff and the warm welcome we received at check-in were harbingers of a fantastic extended family week-end in Miami. Certain floors (condo suites) in the hotel are under going renovation...but the work was almost unnoticeable..and very quiet....In fact, this is a very quiet hotel!!The breathtaking views and condo-suite amenities contributed to my family's protestations to stay a few more days. I call the Doubletree Grand on Biscayne...a hidden jewel in Miami for those who demand quality, but at affordable prices!

<Content>Very nice! I stayed here recently while in Miami on business. My 8th floor 鈥渃ity-view鈥?room was very large, with a king bed, wonderful bathroom, and a large balcony with a water view. There are two sinks (one outside of the shower/toilet room) allowing two to get ready at the same time. The bed was very comfortable and the room 鈥?and maybe entire floor 鈥?appears to have been recently renovated. There鈥檚 a single serve coffee maker, mini-bar (very expensive), and a small microwave. I did not get to try the pool or other facilities. The only problems I encountered were some challenges getting the internet access to work, and the lack of a TV channel guide. Valet only parking is $29/day 鈥?if you don鈥檛 need a car cabs are always available and a relatively cheap option. Primos in the lobby is good for a casual meal or quick drink (the calamari appetizer is great!). Or walk two blocks to Biscayne and 18th where you鈥檒l find a nice sushi place and Bin Number 18 鈥?a wonderful, Mediterranean style bistro with an extensive beer and wine list as well as great food (the bruschetta is large enough to be a light meal for one). There鈥檚 also a small, very pricy, grocery store and a few other shopping options on the ground floor.

<Content>Good Experience We had a good experience at the Doubletree. We booked a 2 bedroom Condo, it was an bayview, with 2 balconies. It was very modern and large, as we have 3 teenagers. The kitchen had granite countertops and new stainless steel appliances, very nice. Two and a half baths, very large, marble, double sinks, huge shower. The master bedroom had an enormous walk in closet/dressing area with beautiful dark wood built in appointments. There were 3 flat screen TVs. My only criticism would be we had to wait about 5 hours with numerous requests to the front desk for a rollaway bed. The Condo was painted in nice colors, but poorly done. Lots and lots of comfortable space for a large family to spread out it. Convienient to walk to several restuarants close by, the doubletree is physically attached to the Biscayne Bay Marriott. This is a very close hotel to the Port of Miami if you are pre or post cruise, you can see the ships if you have a waterview room.

<Content>Really Bad We had a bad stay at the Doubletree. The rooms in the center part of the hotel are old. The carpet was ripped; the towels had holes in them; the room smelled of mildew and carpet fresh. The front desk doesn't answer the phone, and we never got the internet cable they said they would deliver. In December the beach is really busy, but there is no transportation across the bay to the beach. The traffic was so bad that the cab drivers wouldn't take us to Southbeach, but the front desk advised that we drive there and told us where to park. I don't think they have ever been to the beach.

However, hotel lobby staf f dealt with this for us and kept our bags secure until we requested them the following morning.Hotel superb, we had a bay view room on th 9th floor with stunning views (despite the appalling weather!!) over the bay. Room huge with 2 very comfy beds. Beware of mini bar, as usual very pricey!!Staff were superb, very accommodating and helpful. The guy on the concierge even got us a complimenary limo to an italian at south beach!!All in all a fabulous hotel in a great location for a good price (拢194 for 2 nights).

<Content>Great location and views First I need to state being a Marriott Gold member I have been upgraded to waterfront rooms in each of my stays, great views of the intracoastal. Not sure what my thoughts would be if I was given a room overlooking the construction of the condo being built next door.That being said, the rooms are large, rooms are not new however so there is some wear and tear. Front desk staff not the friendliest, they are oK but nothing special, typical of Miami. Had one issue with a phone charge, Manager never called me back. Parking is $24 per day, it is a pretty effiecent operation however. Great resturaunt on first floor not associated with hotel, it is a small Italian place and is on your right as you come in the front door excellent drink prices and decent cheap food.Hotel is a part of the Grand Condo complex, lots of traffic coming in and out. I guess the value of this hotel depends on the price you pay and the room you get. I have paid $149/night the three times I was there. At that price I consider it a good deal, but if there rates go up to $200/night during the busy season you will probably be disappointed in the stay.

<Content>when in miami.... We had reservations at this hotel for a 4 night stay. We had reserveda doubles room on a non-smoking floor but when we arrived all they had was a King. They had a double bed room available, but only on a smoking floor. Normally, I wouldn't complain, however, the moment we got off the elevator, the air reeked horribly of stale smoke, enough so that our hair and clothes were instantly permeated with it. I called the front desk and stated the room was unbearable; we needed another room as soon as one became open. I think I called enough thatthey eventually tired of me and mysteriously 'found' another room. Once we were in that room, all was fine. The hotel overlooks the bay,very nice, and the concierge was quite helpful. It's very close to the Biscayne Bay open shopping area with great open air restuarants and stores. It's also close to the cruiselines, but if you're lookingfor a beach hotel, this is a 4 mile trek by vehicle only, over the bridge. Overall summary, be sure to get a nonsmoking floor, the smoking floors are the worst in any hotel I've been in, other than that, the hotel is nice.

<Content>No problems, just a great room I travel over 50% of the time on business, so I have seen a lot of hotel. I booked a junior suite on a Sunday night for one night in August 2007. It was excellent, with a great view of the marina and Miami Beach area. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the room was clean and spacious. The room was a distance down the hall, but not a far as some hotels. I heard no construction. Service was excellent, check in and out a breeze and valet service was quick. The only complaint I had was they have no restaurant of their own and you have to go to one in the nearby mall for breakfast. But my experience was great and I would stay here again.

<Content>For under $150 a good place... Stayed here (2 nights) with my family (myself, wife, and 2 older teenagers) on our way back from a week at the Ritz Carlton St. Thomas.We were originally booked at the Marriott (next door/connected) but they messed up our reservation and suggested we stayed next door at The Grand.To start off the Doubletree Grand is a 'condo - hotel;' meaning that the lower floors of the building is the Doubletree and the upper floors are condos.There is one lobby which splits into 2 elevator banks (one for hotel and one for condo). The general loby is dated with 1980 style brass and pastic-glass lighting. The Front desk for the doubletree is more modern, the staff was most helpful for our last minuet stay. We had a few room options, finding it repulsive to see a kitchen durning our stay we booked the junior suite with 1 king and 1 sofa bed. Not frequenters of Mid-Grade hotels, we were pleasntly suprised. The room was a nice size and the decor was fresh and stylish. Linens were a bit rough by our standards but for the price what do you expect. Balcony was a nice size and a partial view of the bay. Called for additional pillows and a turndown of the room and they responded promptly, including placing cookies on the pillow...intersting touch.Primary reason for staying here was proximatey to the highway, becuase we already enjoyed the relaxation of St. Thomas my wife and daughter wanted to shop. Very close to high-end shopping centers. Pool area was very dated and they didnt provide any pool service or towels, so remember to bring down your bath towels but then make sure you call for more. This is too confusing. The day we left (saturday) the pool was overun by the residents so be prepared to fight for the chairs. Health Club was extensive. The Mall/Arcade area that connects to the Marriott, has some shops and a mini-mart. In general it was a nice place to sleep and a nice home bace equadistant to the beach and shopping. Restaurants are either on the beach or in Coconut Grove area. This seems to be very much a buisness man/convention hotel also close to docks for cruise ship departure.Would proboly never stay here again but was a nice experience. Try the Marriott nextdoor it seemed more updated.If you want to stay on the Beach...Marriott South Beach and The Bentley Beach are great upscale places to stay. If you are on a budget stay at The Grand

<Content>Blah! First and foremost, if you do decide to stay at the Doubletree Grand Hotel Biscayne Bay, ask for a room NEAR THE ELEVATOR! Our room was towards the back of the hotel and took FOREVER to walk to (around several long corners and up a short flight of stairs). This was especially annoying when trying to cart around our luggage. Anyhow, I personally, would never have a desire to stay at this property again. It was in downtown Miami (near just about nothing) which, in my opinion, was incredibly boring and out of the way. Also, the service at the front desk was TERRIBLE! #1 I had booked 2 rooms, one of which a friend was to check into prior to my arrival. She gave my name at the front desk and was rudely told by the agent that they didn't have a record of the reservation and to wait in the lobby for me to arrive. When I did arrive, I gave my name to the agent (a different agent than the one she had dealt with) and had no issues. In other words, my friend had to wait for an hour sitting in the lobby for no good reason. #2 My best girlfriend called the front desk for an ammenity and was rudely told that they would not bring it to the room, but that she'd have to come down and get it herself. Which, being that our room was a quarter of a mile away from the elevator, she said forget it.#3 When we came back to our room in the evening, we found that our room key card was no longer working. I called from my friends room only to be rudely told once again that I'd have to come back to the front desk to receive a new one. I explained to the agent that our room was incredibly far from the elevator and would like for somebody to bring me a new key, as my feet were now blistered at this point from the quarter mile long walk from the elevator to our room. She maintained her position that in order to receive a new card we'd have to come to the front desk to pick one up. Um, HELLO! It's not my fault that the key stopped working! Work with me here! Grrrr...The pool has an amazing view and was huge, but very boring. They have a bar that isn't even open, so in order to get any sort of drink you have to bring it up from the lobby.Our room was, however, very nice and clean. An entire wall full of huge windows with a partial view of the water. Our bed was just fine and the room in general was very modern. I will post pictures as soon as I can.

<Content>Worst Hotel Ever I stayed at the Doubletree Grand Hotel on March 28, 2007, on a business trip. It was the worst hotel ever. I booked a regular room, but I was told when I arrived that I had been upgraded to a condo suite. If by upgraded, they meant put into a den of revulsion, they were right. -The room was not clean.-The room had mold on the baseboards. -The bathroom door was being held together with a clamp. -The furniture was all stained.-Neither television worked.-The room had no internet, so I couldn't do my work. I later had to pay to use the painfully slow internet in their business office.-The vent in the bedroom did not work, so the bedroom was hot and sticky.-When I called the front desk, the bedside phone was sticky, and it didn't work. The other phone worked, but apparently, the woman at the front desk wasn't willing to work. I asked to switch rooms, and I was told that there were none available, and there was nothing she could do for me; I could talk to a manager the next day (very helpful). It was too late to look for a different hotel, so I stayed and slept fully clothed.I complained to a manager the next day, as the extremely unhelpful front desk woman had suggested the night before. She was very nice, apologizing and eventually offering me a free night at the hotel. Understand, she wasn't comping me for the night that I was there; she was offering me a free night in the future. She said that she wanted me to have a good experience at the hotel. I agreed, and she said that she would mail me a certificate for a free night. Three weeks later, I have still not received this certificate, not that it matters.

<Content>Interesting Experience My husband and I stayed at the Doubletree before we were leaving on a cruise. Let me start by saying, that although the hotel is close to the port, it is still a $15 cab ride to the port of Miami. The hotel is about a $15-$20 cab ride from the airport, and about a $20 cab ride to South Beach. Becides what is in the hotel (which is rather impressive, a deli, mini grocery store, restaurants, business center, work out facility, huge pool), there is nothing to do within walking distance. There is a free rail system (about a 3 minute walk from the hotel) that will take you around the area, which is great. We were unable to check in early, which was fine, but when we arrived at 3pm, they tried to tell us that we booked a Condo. This seemed crazy to me, but she insisted that we see the room because they are much nicer than the hotel rooms. We were very impressed with the condo, the kitchen was terrible, but we had a kitchen nonetheless, a washer/dryer, great view, beautifully decorated. The bed was uncomfortable (I was looking forward to the Sweet Dreams bed) but we figured we must have booked the room wrong.We did check out our reservation, we did not book a condo, and the manager later told us that the hotel was sold out, so they had to give us a condo. Overall, I'm happy I stayed there.

<Content>Rooms vary greatly!! We had originally booked a 2 room suite with the hotel, but upon booking the person advised me that for 20 dollars more I could have a 2 bedroom condo, with all the same amenties and more. I chose this option and I should have realized when something seems to good to be true there must be a catch - there certainly was! We got to our condo and the first thing we are greeted with is a dead/dried up palm tree plant. Nice! We then noticed how shabby and dated the furnishings were. The beds we horrible and the carpets were stained and disgusting. The only positives were the view and the spaciousness of the unit. We called to complain but nothing could be done until the next day, because apparently the hotel was sold out. After a horrible first night, the hotel made amends by switching us to a much smaller, but much nicer 1 bedroom unit. This one was updated and looked more like the website photos. The manager (Carlos) compted our first night and gave us our new unit at a well reduced rate. So depending on what condo unit you get, you could have very drastic experiences. I assume that the hotel rooms are more consistent.

<Content>Don't waste your time or money here We decided to stay here based on some of the reviews written here and it was close to our cruise ship. What a mistake it was a nightmare, by far the worst hotel we have ever stayed in! I had made the reservation several months in advance and booked a suite, there were 5 adults traveling together, the hotel was aware that we would not arrive till around 11:00 pm or later. When we arrived around 11pm we were told that the room that we had booked was not available because the people that were staying there from the night before and decided to extend their vacation. They said they would fix it tomorrow and we could have two rooms and they would only charge us for one. I asked them if they would please not put us next to a construction area. (I had read on this site a review explaining how awful the nosie was), the manager said okay no problem. So we agreed because we were exhausted. We asked them if they had a place where we could eat because none of us had eaten most of the day. They said no everything shuts down for the night and there was no place to suggest, no room service, nothing, they were less then helpful. Our rooms were entirely in two different areas of the hotel and were only able to accomdate sleeping for 4 people, so one guest had to sleep on the couch. The one room was okay but the other room was right next to the construction. This room was dirty and old. There were dead bugs in the shower door. It was late, we were very tried, and just decided to stay and deal with it tomorrow. The next day we went to see the manager on duty and he assured us that our room would be ready by 3pm that day because the people decided on late check out. I asked him are you sure that we will have a different room and everything be okay the next day and he said yes. When we went back to our room we noticed the cleaning woman was there, so we left, when we returned she had left the trash, threw out the bag my toothbush was still in and threw out my contacts. She took a towel away and never replaced it and gave us no soap. We went back to the front desk and explained to the manager MIguel what just happened and that one person was sleeping on a couch, the room was disgusting dirty he again offered no assistance. When we returned later in the day to the hotel for our room he said that the people decided to stay another night, I said we cannot stay in that room and I want our orginal reservation like you had promised. He said he has another room, he wrote it on a paper and said to meet the engineer there with the key. We went up to the room and waited several minutes, no one showed up so we knocked on the door thinking he was already inside preparing our room. A woman answered the door and had no idea what we were talking about. Furious we went downstairs and asked what is going on, when we were told that the manager is working on it, and would get in touch with us. In the meantime we contacted Hilton Honors Customer Service and explained to them our situation. They called the hotel while I remained on hold. They were told that they had no room ready, because of a key that was held by a previous owner. (That is when we found out that the hotel just manages the condo's and rents them out). Hilton Honors customer service went on to tell us that the manager went home for the day and assigned the task to someone else. Customer service said she would personally filed a complaint because this was not acceptable. We didn't leave because I had signed a document and was told that I would be charged the money for the room regardless if we stay or not, we didn't have a car, and didn't know where to go. It is really not a safe area. We then said we would wait for his call and go to dinner. We returned from dinner around 7pm and decided there was no sense in doing anything at this point because we were leaving in the morning. At 10:30pm that night we get a call to tell us about our room. We told him forget it we would be leaving in the morning, it was to late!

<Content>Pick somewhere else The hotel was not very great for any amount of money. We had a two bedroom suite overlooking the bay. The view was great but the rooms were dirty. The first room they checked us into had cigarette butts on the balcony and paint buckets in the closet. The toilet seat was up and it had contents in need of flushing. I asked for a room that maybe they were ready to rent and they acted like I was the one being rude. They told me that I better like the next one because it was all they had. It was a little bit nicer simply because it was cleaner. The whole place was really dated and in need of a major overhaul. For the most part the staff were unimpressive. We payed the penalty for early checkout and moved to another location. Save yourself the aggravation.

<Content>Excellent hotel  I struggled to find a hotel in Miami with consitent reviews, so plumped for this one, part of the Hilton Hotel chain as I thought we couldn't go wrong. And we couldn't! The hotel  it's facilities were excellent, we were within a mall with shops  restaurants which was great. The concierge desk was a bonus too, they gave us some great tips on where to go.We were there 2 nights  although the price was slightly higher that anticipated, I was happy to pay it because of the facilities within the hotel.The bus station is just round the corner from the hotel so we took that during the day. If you are in a wheelcharit (which my father-in-law is), it's a great way to get about. We went to South Beach to explore for the day. In the evening we took a taxi back to South Beach for dinner.Would recommend this place to people, as long as you don't mind the travelling into South Beach for the action!

<Content>Great Hotel To Wait For A Cruise This is a great hotel to book into just prior to a cruise out of Miami -- which is what we did. It is one mile from the port.The hotel granted us early check-in. The front desk staff was very accomodating to us, even though we arrived at 10AM, well before the 3PM check-in time.I had paid for a bayside-view room and was not disappointed. Our room, 964, was a very nice corner room with windows looking out on the bay and down the side. The room also had a balcony looking out on the bay and boat docks below. Our very nice bellman, Justin, told us that in the morning we could just look over at the port from our room and see our ship, a few miles away.The hotel room was a bit warmer than we liked (because of all the glass and greehouse effect) but it was still very comfortable. It is a very large room, with two sinks outside the bathroom and a large dressing area. Also a large desk for those wanting to do any work.The room is far away from the elevator but well worth the walk!! The hotel building is half hotel and half condos. The pool and jacuzi is absolutely magnificent. It also overlooks the port and is located on a mid-level rooftop. For most of the day, we were the only people in the pool.Foodwise, the hotel complex has a lot to offer. In the adjoining complex there was a great steakhouse where we had dinner and a wonderful deli that served great lunches. Also a convenience shop for toiletries and newspapers is located there. Justin the bellman told us there are seven restaurants in all. We were very satisfide with this hotel and plan to stay there again.

<Content>Doubletree Grand Needs updating I stayed at the DoubleTree Grand Hotel. I looked at serveral rooms. The Junior Suite and Grand Bay Suite were nice, but rooms need to be better maintained. I looked at a few one bedroom Condos. One was nice but needed paint touchup and the other two were not really that nice but they do have a kitchen. The amenities, location, and service were a plus. I was told that this hotel has just been renovated and I can tell you that from what I saw it was not. It needs to be better maintained. No self parking, valet is $24 per day.Complimentary Internet in rooms. No wireless internet.Lots of Construction around the hotel.

<Content>Great facilities The doubletree is in a great location, overlooking Biscayne Bay. Our room was huge with air-conditioning, a balcony, room safe and a huge TV. However, the shower was disappointing as it was very underpowered and had a poor spray head - it was difficult to get wet enough to clean yourself!The hotel was not quite a centrally located as we had expected but this was not a problem as it has a couple of restaurants and bars attached, and even a small shopping mall!What made this hotel fantastic was the rooftop pool and jacuzzi on the 10th floor, both of which are huge, clean and a great place to relax. Although you are in the middle of a huge city, the pool area was a haven away from the busy streets below.The hotel also has what appeared to be excellent facilities for guests that use a wheelchair, including an automated lift into and out of the pool.Overall, a very comfortable hotel, with good facilities, a great view and warm cookies on arrival!

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel is great!I was about five minutes in my room when the front desk call to verify if the accomodations were to our satisfaction. I had a standard room with a partial city and bay view. The room was spacious, never feeling cramped and had a fantastic marble bath room. The comfort of the bed was the best. A pillow top mattress with a goose down duvet and plenty of pillows to spare. The pool is also great, almost olympic size with views of the bay and cruise ships that are in port. I did not eat at the hotel's restaurant but did try their deli which by the way is delicious.There are a couple of glitches about the property location and my room. I did not have a balcony nor did I request one. My problem was no means of air ventilation from the outside. There was a sliding door (that does not open) and what seems to be some what of a balcony-but not really. I notice the door was constructed to be maintained permanently locked. Of course I had air conditioning but still cared for the evening breeze. With regards to the hotel location, it is located in the financial district. One would assume there were be a few good restaurants around but not so. The closest thing is a Burger King a couple of blocks away which I don't recommend going there at night. Your best bet is to eat in the hotel restaurant or deli.

Definately a DO! - especially if you are booked on a cruise that leaves out of the Port of Miami.

<Content>Not for business travellers I have stayed at this hotel several times when visiting Miami on business. This trip was slightly longer than usual (four days) and so...some problems were revealed. The front desk staff are completely overwhelmed, I was first sent to a room that wasn't clean and told I would not have internet service. The second room was smoking even though I requested Non, it was all they had and I was forced to take it. I paid a full rate of 189.00 It was liveable, then woke up in the morning with bug bites all over my hand. Yuck! Cleaning staff did not bring towels and it took four phone calls, a trip to the front desk and a call to the sales manager to get them brought up. Towels and a bug free room seem basic. On the upside, it has a great gym and is conveniently located. If you only have a nite to spend, and you get a good rate, it might be ok.

<Content>Typical Doubletree My stay at the Doubletree was unremarkable - which is why I picked it. Since I was traveling during high season my choices were limited if I didn't want to cost my company a small fortune. I like the Doubletree because I acrue miles. I booked online at the hotel's website to ensure that I would have a non-smoking room. When I arrived, they did not have a non-smoking room in the room class that I reserved so they upgraded me to a junior suite with a bay view. Quite honestly, if you are going to pay the amount of money that a junior suite costs, then I suggest that you pay for a regular room at a boutique or nicer hotel. However, I like Doubletrees because they are pretty consistent and have the amenities I need for business travel. My room was nice, clean, and relatively quiet considering that there was a lot of construction going on across the street. I did have a much better than average experience at their Los Gauchitos restaurant. The food was average but the service was much better than most restaurants in Miami and South Beach (which is awful). Don't stay here if you want to get to South Beach all the time. This hotel is located on the mainland in Biscayne Bay. There is an elevated train nearby but I have no idea where it goes. You get exactly what you expect when you stay at this hotel. I would recommend it to business travelers.

<Content>Omni was decent overall We spent a night at DoubleTree Grand Hotel before our cruise. Overall I would give a thumbs up to the hotel although the staff at the front desk seemed to be overwhelmed at times. This may have something to do with our group of 12 that was checking in at the same time. The hotel was fairly modern and the rooms were fairly nice although if you are looking for a quiet hotel I would choose another hotel since they are building two high rise condos right next door. We only tried one of the restaurants which was the Deli when you first enter the hotel. The food was ok but we thought the bartender was fantastic! He told us about the various attractions that were close by the hotel and the best way to get our group to and from. Again, a decent hotel with great potential.

<Content>Disappointing We booked the Doubletree over the New Year for 3 nights, and had a room for a family of 4. The room was okay, and had a great view over the harbour, but overall we were disappointed.The decor is tired, and cleaning standards are not too great.We usually stay near the beach, but wanted to be near Bayside on this visit. From a location perspective the hotel worked, you can get the free metrorail to Bayside, but if staying in the area again I would try somewhere else.

<Content>Loved Doubletre Grand We were going on a cruise and this was our Pre and Post-stay hotel. It was GREAT. The king sized beds are plush and larger than your average store-bought king sized bed. Our room had a fantastic view of the marina and the meals from room service were filling due to the large portions and very tasty.

<Content>Doubletree Grand Was Grand - Perfect Pre-Cruise Stay! Our stay at the Doubletree Grand Hotel was wonderful! The room was comfortable and spacious, with a balcony overlooking the marina. We could see the Port of Miami from our balcony, and could watch some of the ships going in and out of port. The beds were very comfortable with exceptionally nice linens and duvets. The room was quiet, the staff was friendly and helpful. The warm cookies when you check in is a nice touch that Doubletree has. Because we came to the hotel directly from the airport via taxi and didn't leave the hotel complex until noon the next day when it was time to head to the Port to embark on a cruise, we had time to explore the complex. The hotel is part of a complex that houses condos on the upper floors, shops, restaurants, offices and a marina. The hotel rooms are on the lower floors, but they are still high enough to afford a great view of Biscayne Bay. We bought gourmet take-out food from the Deli in the hotel complex and the food was excellent and reasonably priced for the size of the portions. We took the food back to our room, but there was a seating area if you wanted to eat at the Deli. The back part of the Deli doubles as a convenience store for the residents of the condos upstairs and so they carry a little bit of everything. A full liquor store was available, too, if that's important to you. There was a good variety of other full service restaurants in the hotel complex, as well. The pool was large and warm, and located on a terrace several floors up from the noise of the street. The clover-shaped hot tub was huge. Palms and tropical flowers around the pool gave it a tropical feel. One of the nicest hotel pools I have ever seen. The gift shops in the hotel complex had an interesting variety and some really lovely things. Now for things that were not perfect - the TV remote didn't work - it probably needed the batteries replaced. I could have called to see what they could do about it, but I didn't - we were only staying one night and it just wasn't a big deal. The other thing was that the marble bathroom had a bidet. My 13 year old daughter was enthralled, and wanted to try it, as she had not seen one before. The water just trickled out, no water pressure, perhaps because it isn't used by many visitors. Oh, and a word of warning - the pigeons are shameless beggars, and when my daughter took her pizza out on the balcony to eat, they were pretty brazen. This was a wonderful pre-cruise stay, and a great start to our vacation. I would absolutely stay here again. I booked this hotel directly on the Hilton/Doubletree website and got an internet rate that was well below what other sites were advertising. I also got exactly the room I had reserved, too. This hotel would also be a good place to stay for travelers with business in downtown Miami, as it is located about 1 mile north of downtown. We paid about $10 extra I think for the bay view room, and I think it was well worth it. The rooms that face the bay are a bit far from the elevator, though, so if walking a little is a problem, you might want to consider a room with a view of the pool or downtown instead.
