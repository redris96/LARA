<Content>Good hotel in excellent location New York is no longer a cheap destination, but the 414 Hotel is probably as good a deal as you can get. Situated in a charming street 5 minutes walk from Times Square, the location of this hotel is hard to beat. Restaurant Row is near at hand and you never need to walk far for an excellent meal or live music.The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Don't be put off by the rather depressing brown stair carpet, its not a good first impression. However the rooms are spacious and comfortably equipped. Rooms are well serviced daily. Yes some of the paint work does need freshening up, but we found our room warm and comfortable. Probably the best hotel bed I have ever slept in. If you take comfortable shoes and warm clothes (in Winter) you can walk to most of the main sites from the 414. Breakfast is included but not worth staying in for. Great cafe on the corner that does the bigest pancakes I have ever seen!In conclusion a good hotel I would be happy to recommend to anyone.

<Content>NY's best kept secret This is a long overdue review. I wanted to keep this hotel my little secret, as it is small, affordable and convenient. NY hotels cost a lot of money, and this place is perfect for a business traveler on a budget. The rooms aren't fancy, and you should not expect great service. But if you want a *quiet*, affordable, relatively clean place to stay, then this is it. I can't believe there are quiet hotel rooms in NYC, but if you request a room in the back building, you will certainly sleep soundly.My brother was passing through and missed a late-night flight. He was due to take a train out of Penn Station the next morning. I called the hotel around midnight, and they had one room left. They took great care of him and he was refreshed and ready to go the next morning, with a quick walk to Penn.

<Content>Great Little Spot This is a long overdue review. I want to echo the positive comments from others who have booked a room here. I am a NY native who NEVER stays overnight because I live closeby. Knowing how incredibly expensive a one night hotel stay can be, i searched for a budget place that was in a good spot because I was in the city for a 2 day conference with my husband.This is it. Clean, affordable, and just what you need for sightseeing. The place is literally nestled in Restaurant Row (Check out Becco and their fresh pasta symphony...delish!) with dozens of meal options right outside your door. I paid just over 200 bucks for one night and that is a complete STEAL compared to what is out there. Plus, the small continental breakfast was just enough to get you started.The inn will not have all the amenities to be expected from a large hotel. It is an inn; hence it is smaller and more intimate. We had a room facing the courtyard which was remarkably quiet. Yes there are no elevators so beware heavy packers who get a room beyond the first floor.I would definitely return; in fact, i tried booking for Nov. but they were sold out!

<Content>Clean, pretty, well-located I really liked the 414 Inn and stayed there in August 2008. Bedbug-free.There was only a house number, 414, on the outside; no sign. The lobby was small and included two modern black leather chairs as well as three or four small circular tables, each with two red chairs. The decor was in slate grays, red, black and white. There is a motif of historic photos of NYC throughout the hotel, which was lovely.Breakfast was served from 7-10am and included coffee, tea, croissants and small bagels. The Inn has red and white plates and pretty red mugs (that can also be purchased) for the coffee as well as to go cups for coffee on the go.The room was small but clean. Amenities included crisp, white sheets, lightweight down comforter, a mini-fridge and window unit air conditioner. Service was prompt and good. The bathrooms had old-school small hexagonal tile in black-and-white, a white modern pedestal sink and standard shower. There was no closet, but there was a modern rack that easily held clothes that needed to be hung up. There was also a dresser for folded clothes, and two bedside tables. We were on the first floor, but I understand that there are third-floor rooms and no elevator. We also encountered noise as people went in-and-out of the courtyard.The brick-lined courtyard had pretty landscaping and cute tile tables that were of good quality. It was a pleasant space to sit outside and enjoy coffee in the morning.

<Content>Would definitely stay there again! Stayed at the 414 Hotel for 3 nights. Enjoyed the central location and is within easy walking distance of subway. The hotel was fully booked, but never heard anyone else, although I saw folks at breakfast. Enjoyed the continental breakfast which certainly helped with expenses. By New York standards, the room and bathroom were a nice size. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and we slept well every night. When we arrived, the air conditioner was off and it took a while to cool the room, but once cooled, everything was fine. The staff was very nice and helpful. The only drawback to the hotel is no elevator. Also, for some reason, the stairwell and hallways are painted a dark color; a lighter color would sure make a difference.

<Content>Great find in NYC! What a gem for NYC. The location is awesome, close to Broadway and Times Square, but off on a very quiet street. The room was large and bathroom was very spacious, especially for New York. The air-conditioning worked fine and the desk people were very pleasant.There are no elevators, so be prepared to carry your luggage upstairs...I was on the 3rd floor, there were 2 more levels above me. They are a little short on some amenities, like no place to safely store luggage before or after checking in or out, but have some others that are nice, like free wireless internet, free continental breakfast and kitchen privileges. Overall, they offer a nice quiet stay in a very busy city for a very reasonable price.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Price (for NY) I recently stayed at the 414 in order to attend a conference at CUNY in Harlem. The 414 was close to the #1 subway train that travel to and from that area, but I also chose the hotel based on its excellent location in Midtown Manhattan near great restaurants, theaters, and Times Square. I arrived around 12 PM, and although I wasn't able to secure an early check-in, the friendly front desk staff assured me that I could leave my suitcase and someone would take it to my room for me. This was actually a great service, as my suitcase was large and heavy, the stairwell was narrow, and it was three flights up to my room on the fourth floor.When I returned a few hours later, my suitcase was indeed in my room as promised. The room itself looked as if it was recently renovated, with a nice large bed, flat screen TV on the wall, and photographs of NY around the room. There were some small issues with the room. There was a little water damage on the ceiling of the room, and some of the grout around the tile above the bathtub was dark. I also found the bathroom sink puzzling, as the water turned on regardless of whether you turned the knobs left or right. Since you needed to manipulate both knobs to avoid very hot or cold water, it made getting the water to stop completely a bit of a trick.To me, these were all very minor inconveniences. I loved my room, especially the comfortable bed. The room felt large enough, and I didn't mind the three flights of stairs one bit even after walking around the city every day. It was also convenient to have WiFi in the hotel, and a computer in the lobby to check email.While this property is listed as a hotel, it could also be considered a bed and breakfast (the awning of the property actually says bed and breakfast). The breakfast is pretty modest, with croissants, muffins, bagels, cereal, coffee, and juices, and usually one type of fruit, such as bananas. But since it was included in the room price, I was happy with what was provided.I think where this hotel excels is the quality of its service. I was particularly impressed with Jessica. She was always very friendly and helpful. She called a car for me on my last day that was as cheap as a cab, but was essentially a limo sedan. I was told it would be $33 with tax and tip, but when I arrived at the airport, the driver informed me it was $33 without tip and without a $5 toll. The ride was fast and comfortable, so I didn't mind paying a bit more.Jessica also helped me print my boarding pass from the hotel, as I was attending a late Broadway performance and had little time to get to the airport once it was over. I felt like she really went above and beyond, especially given the horror stories you hear about rude staff at other hotels.I really recommend this hotel. My colleagues at my conference discussed a variety of other hotels where they were staying, and I think I had the cheapest rate and the best experience. If you can get by without the elevator, I think its a fantastic place to stay and I'll definitely return to the 414 when I'm back in NY.Joe SalvatoreSouth Lyon, MI

<Content>Wonderful Stay Hotel 414 was wonderful; affordable, clean, convenient location, your own washroom, flat screen TV with loads of cable channels, complimentry WiFi  breakfast. I stayed at a hostel in NYC just 2 months ago and the experience is still haunting, I really appreciate everything Hotel 414 has to offer. (Mind you the hostel costs $170-180 after tax a night which is not much cheaper than 414)I would definitely stay at 414 again and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.

<Content>Great experience with a group at the Hotel 414 Our recent stay at Hotel 414 with group of 10 high school students was most pleasant., and if you are looking for a clean, comfortable, convenient place for a group, this is it. The staff is wonderful and made us feel most welcome. The rooms are cozy. The beds and pillows are excellent...even our teens commented on how comfortable they were. Although a few blocks from a subway stop, thought the location was great for us...close enough to Times Square, but far enough away to be on a quiet street with a neighborhood feel. It was a sweet place to return to after a full day and evening of seeing the sights. Nice little kitchen with good coffee and continental breakfast and fresh fruit. The price is right if you are on a budget and/or traveling with a group. Great experience!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Just got back to the UK after having spent a wonderful few days in New York. Having never been before I was a bit unsure as to what to expect of the hotel.I shouldn't have worried, it was great. Our room was massive with a big bed (queen size) and a huge plasma screen on the wall - and a big bathroom. We even had a little fridge and a safety box.Our room was at the back with a view of the little terrace. It was incredibly quiet and peaceful.Breakfast was great, bagels and cream cheese, muffins and croissants and unlimited juice and coffee.We had a problem with our air conditioning the first night but when we got back the following day it was working and made a real difference as it was quite hot in the room.It was in a fab location just 10 minutes from Times Square.All in all - a fantastic hotel. Book it now !!

<Content>An Excellent Sport The hotel is very well-located near the theater district, with great restaurants and a great deli and wine shop just up around 9th Ave. We stayed for five nights, and had a comfortable bed and good service, especially from Greg. The only drawback is that here's not much public space and what's there is pretty minimal. The little courtyard is lovely, but not much use at this time of year. Excellently priced for the area, however--you can't have everything unless you really, really want to pay for it.

<Content>An Excellent find! Highly Recommended This hotel is brilliant - just what is needed if sightseeing or on business. The rooms are cosy and modern, the bed is to die for, I found it hard to get up in the morning. The large plasma screen at the foot of the bed is a bonus and the hospitality first class. Staff are very helpful particularly Greg who knows just about everything there is to know about New York. Refreshments are available all day free of charge and the breakfast is basic but is very fresh and healthy. The location is great - Hell's Kitchen at the end of the road, a few blocks to Times Square, Broadway and good shopping Couldn't have wished for a better location.I highly recommend this hotel, it's perfect for all types of travellers, although not enough space for children perhaps, the court yard area is sweet and captures the real essence of a New York outside space, the building has character and there is a real charm to it. We will definately stay here again.

<Content>Great deal Great location! We were visiting our daughter and her apartment was a block and a half away. The hotel is also an easy walking distance from Times Square, Broadway, Central Park and the river. Our room was very comfortable and overlooked a wierd old church built in the 1870's. The bathroom was a nice size, particularly for NYC, with lots of counter space. The room was decorated with large old photos of NY. The street is really cool and quiet, we were awakened by the sound of horse carts clip-clopping down the street. Breakfast until 10 means not having to get up early. We had a little refrigerator in our room. It was inexpensive for NYC. My only complaint was how dark the stairway was (no elevator). Dark carpet, dark walls, no lights. I could hardly see the first step. We plan to stay here again.

<Content>lovely hotel. great value. good position. Great cheap hotel. The room was lovely and clean. You're right by time square, some great restaurants (joe allens was great - get the meatloaf) all the broadway shows, the cheap ticket desk is on the same street if you want to buy same day tickets at half price. We bookended our honeymoon to mexico from london with two nights at the start and end in new york. We finished up at the library, which was over twice the price, although great aswell. i would recommend doing something similair. however if i was to have just one hotel i would go with the 414, there are so many other things in new york to sepnd your money on than just a hotel!

<Content>Very Happy at the 414! We arrived at the 414 on Jan. 24th to begin a weekend celebration of my 50th birthday. What a great place to stay! Probably the best feature is the location ~ close to Times Square, several subway stations, and Restaurant Row is right there. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was just enough before heading out for sight seeing or shopping. Greg was absolutely wonderful! He loves his job and it shows. He takes great care to be sure that all guests are comfortable and he goes out of his way to help with recommendations, reservations, etc. Economically speaking, I think you're getting a great value for your money when you stay here. I look forward to staying here again on our next trip to NYC!

<Content>Hidden Gem! I had booked this place online months earlier, so we didn't know what to expect, but when we stumbled onto our hotel (just off of Times Square and the theater district) we were wonderfully surprised! You would never guess it from the outside, but once in the lobby we were greeted by a roaring fire, hot coffee  free wireless. And we got some juicy NYC secrets from the really sweet employees. But the best part was the amazingly comfortable bed!!! With a quiet room, plasma screen  a noon check out time, we were in NO hurry to leave!! the 414 Hotel has now become our NYC staple!

<Content>Loved It!! HIghly Recommended OK so - NYC is a tricky place to find a hotel. I was there for a Fashion tradeshow, so I needed to be somewhat close to the Javitz. When on the phone, they were extremely polite... they had to upgrade us to a nicer room b/c they didn't have any 2 twin rooms left (fine with me!). We got a big room (esp. for NYC) near the courtyard, which ended up being very quiet and peaceful. The staff was sooooo nice and helpful, and the property seems very safe. I have told everyone I know who travels to NYC about this hidden little secret. Highly recommended!

<Content>Hidden Treasure I stayed in this hotel the week before Christmas and it was so lovely that I nearly did not write a review, in case this hidden treasure gets too popular and booked up!!I have previously stayed in some large mid-price hotels in New York aimed at tourists, which appear to be over-priced, with cramped rooms and in need of updating. So 414 was a very lucky find. It is small (22 bedrooms) and well maintained. It has been refurbished in the last couple of years. Don't be put off by the dark brown paint on the walls of the stairs and hallway, the rooms are bright, light and larger than the average New York hotel room.Unusually for New York a continental breakfast is provided with an excellent choice of croissants, bagels and muffins, fruit or cereals. There is also coffee, tea and juice. It is self-service, mugs are provided for the coffee and teas, and disposable plates / bowls etc for the food. The tea and coffee is available all day as it is not provided in the bedrooms. Breakfast is eaten in the small foyer area in front of a cheery, warming fire.The bedrooms as stated are large, bright and airy, with double glazed windows, and air conditioning units. I stayed in room 402 which was well decorated and had a small fridge, plenty of storage space, an iron, a safe and a very large wall-mounted TV. The bathroom was also quite large and modern with a shower and small bath. Everything was kept spotlessly clean during my stay and the staff were pleasant and very helpful.There is wireless internet access throughout the hotel and a computer guests can use to check e-mails in the lobby. There are also daily newspapers and magazines in the lobby. As it was winter I did not make use of the courtyard garden however I expect this is a wonderful place to breakfast in the summer.All in all I had a wonderful stay. I recommend phoning the hotel direct for a booking as I tried to book through websites but got a better deal for a week long stay by phoning directly. One negative point is possibly the lack of a lift. My room was on the 4th floor which was also the top floor, but remember in the USA the 1st floor = the UK ground floor. I think this lack of a lift might explain why the hotel has not got better 'star' ratings, but if you are OK with stairs then I highly recommend this little hotel which is very handy for Times Square and all the restaurants along 46th Street between 8th and 9th.

<Content>Really friendly and helpful staff, b I've just returned from a fabulous week in New York. Had read reviews for 414 before I went so was hoping everything good that had been said about it was true. I was not disappointed. The hotel is small but very friendly. All the staff were lovely and very helpful with helping us book trips and making our stay comfortable. We stayed in the apartment at the back which was quieter, although did hear the main door closing as guests came and went in the night, but with earplugs I wasn't disturbed! Lots of places to eat on the doorstep as the 414 is on restaurant row. I would recommend The Joshua Tree just along in the next block on the way to Times Square; very friendly staff and food is good (especially the fish and chips!). The only problem we had was one night when the heating wasn't working but that was all fine the next day. The rooms were clean but nothing fancy so don't expect anything too luxurious. Breakfast was provided every morning which consisted of huge croissants, muffins, rolls and spreads, and cereals, which set us up for most of the day. Locaqtion was brilliant - right in the centre of everything only being a short walk from Times Square and Rockefeller Centre. I would definately go back to this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>This place is a little gem This hotel is a little gem. It's a converted townhouse with about 16 rooms, just across from 'Restaurant Row' You're only 5 minutes from Broadway, and 10/15 mins from Rockefeller Centre, Macy's, and the Empire State Building. Central Park is approximately a 20 minute walk, although the buses and underground are quick and convenient. The hotel is small, but everyone friendly and helpful - any problems at all and they were happy to oblige. The rooms are good sized, clean and comfortable (very comfortable beds for the weary traveller) and there is complementary breakfast in a morning as well as free internet use for guests in the lobby. This hotel is a welcome change from the big impersonal hotels you see all too often these days, highly recommended - we loved it.

<Content>Greg's the best!!!!!!!!!! I would thoroughly recommend this hotel!!!Sure, it's not a big hotel, it hasn't got the thrills of one of the major ones but that's not what we were after. We didn't want to hear sirens all through the night like we did when we stayed at the ramadaplaza new yorker the last time we stayed in manhattan.The 414 is a lovely little hotel with very friendly and always helpful staff particularly GREG. GREG advised us of the best places to eat (as he's a native new yorker), exciting places to go and we found ourselves talking for ages about everything. Greg has left a lasting impression on us and although we have only been back home 2 days we miss him and our conversations already.We stayed in room 102 and it was very clean and everything worked. The maid service was fantastic and the room was cleaned to a high standard everyday.The location of the hotel was fantastic only being a couple of blocksfrom time square.There was no safe in the room but we were able to store our private documents etc in the hotel safe which was signed in and out each timewe needed them.This is one of the very few hotels that offer a breakfast of any sorts. Alright, it's not a big breakfast being continental but it's enough to get you started for the day and there is always coffee and teas available in the little kitchenette area.We have been to new york now 4 times and have stayed in 4 different hotels and have found the 414 to be the best so far. Infact, we lovedit here so much that we will shortly be booking up for this time nextyear but for 10 days instead of 7.Thanks 414 for making this holiday the best we have had yet!P.S YOU ROCK GREG!!!!Mark and NaomiKent, United Kingdom

<Content>A slice of heaven I was reviewing some hotels  came across 414. With very fond memories, I remembered my trip to new york  my stay at 414 in 2005 . Such hospitality, it was truly a very homely feeling. The rooms are spacious  very contemporary .I enjoyed the bathroom ammenties which were quite comparable to any five star hotel . My job takes me round luxury hotels all the time but this one is truly a star in its own right. Loved the little courtyard ,perfect for an evening setting.Visit the 414, you will enjoy your stay.

<Content>Great Restaurant Row Location I love the proximity to restaurant row dinning! The 414's continental breakfast is just enough to start the day right. Take some time to sip your coffee/tea on the patio. The bedding is comfy and the room doesn't feel cramped like many NY hotel rooms. The wi-fi caused trouble at first, but once they reset it, it worked fine. Plus, there is a computer in the lobby for guest use.A stay at the 414 Hotel in NYC feels more like staying at a friend's house, than the hassle it can be to stay at some larger hotels. I even got a thank you note from the housekeeper when I left a tip. Highly recommended!!

<Content>It was fine Just returned from a great stay in New York city during which we stayed for the most part with family. However one night we stayed down town to meet friends and stayed the night in the 414.We found this hotel to be a good base, it is within a close walking distance of Times Square and Broadway. The bedroom was clean, however I felt that the bathroom floor could have been cleaner. The water in the bath was also not as hot as I would have liked, infact it was lukewarm. Saying this the price of the stay was exceptionally reasonable. I had investigated the possility of other accommodations and I was surprized this hotel was so competitive in price. The beds are very comfortable, there is a flat screen tv and internet access on the ground floor. I found the staff most helpful. The girl at the desk gave us directions to two different restaurants-one expensive, one less expensive. We took the less expensive option and the food proved to be excellent here.

<Content>wouldn't stay again Although the room was clean and the bed comfortable, the front desk and guest service was deplorable. Indifference would be the best way to describe it. The clerk could not even bring herself to get up from her desk (in the room adjacent to the front desk) to answer our tourist type questions. The wake up call we did not receive (and thus nearly missed our tour), when I asked what happened was told 'oh ya there was something wrong with the phone'. When I questioned why he didn't just walk up the stairs and knock on the door...he looked at me blankly offering no apology. I guess customer service is not on the priority list. Also, the morning coffee in styrofoam cups made me feel like I was camping. What would it cost to buy 45 mugs (only 22 rooms afterall!). The big one though is we were awaiting a very important call regarding a meeting time and place. We asked constantly if there were any messages for us and were told time and time again 'no'. Upon our return to Canada, imagine our shock when my employer was surprised we didn't make the appointment. He had left two messages with the hotel. When I phoned to tell them this,...yep you guessed it..indifference. Lastly, waiting outside for 20 minutes at 1am...what happened to the 24hr front desk??? We wondered? If you are to....don't go.Stay somewhere where you feel you are valued and taken care of. It was the only bad thing about New York.

<Content>Very pleased We stayed at Hotel 414 6/29 to 7/2, 2007. This lovely boutique hotel is ideally situated for seeing the sights of NYC - just two blocks from Times Square and right on Restaurant Row. The rooms are small and a bit musty smelling but to be expected for NYC and age of the building. Bed was very comfortable and the giant flat screen tv nice after a day of pounding the pavement.Lovely courtyard with pleanty of seating for putting your feet up with a tall cool one between sightseeing and dinner.Only downside - carpet in room was in dire need of cleaning and the radiator in the bathroom was in desperate need of replacement - was rusty and falling apart.The staff were pleasant and helpful. Continental breakfast okay - no complaints. Free internet access in the lobby was a nice touch.Had a very pleasant stay and would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.

<Content>well-kept secret! We just returned from NYC; we stayed at a great little place, off the beaten path, The 414 Bed  Breakfast. It is located on a side street in the theater district, a fairly quiet street. We arrived earlier than the check-in time  were allowed to leave our luggage in the lobby. Our room was a pleasant surprise; we were expecting a tiny room  throw-rug size bathroom but both rooms were adequate in size, the flat-screen t.v. was great, nice down pillows  comforter. There is a little 'frig, a safe in the closet, a luggage rack,  well furnished. The negative was the poor water pressure from the shower. It takes a while to rinse long hair. Our room was on the 4th floor which was a daily reminder of how out-of-shape one can be after a long day of sight-seeing. The courtyard was pretty  breakfast of pastries, coffee  juice were nice. The staff was very pleasant as well. We were very pleased  will try to stay there again on return trips!

<Content>Right in the Heart or NYC Broadway district This a a great little place centrally located and affordable for NYC Broadway theater trip. It worked for us, staff was friendly and somewhat helpful. This place could use some help the halls are dark(purple) and the staircases are a little tight especially w/ luggage, Breakfast was well ok for continental I guess some muffins, bagels, bananas, cereal, milk, oj, coffee  tea nothing special. Rooms could have used some fresh paint and new carpet, blinds in bath were a little well mildewy but otherwise nice .This hotel is Definantly not spotless but by no means gross . We even had a refrigerator and a huge TV which was nice. There were No Elevator and we had a window air conditioner. But HEY what can you expect for under $200 a night in NYC. We ate at Ruby FOOs restaurant highly recommended atmosphere was beautiful , food was fabulous! FYI get in early we ate at 5:00 that was perfect.

<Content>Combination of reviews Pros: - Great location- Reasonably priced for a NYC hotel- Small  Quiet Hotel- Next to anything you need (but that is NYC for you)-Nicely decorated hotelCons: - Staff was unfriendly, I saw plenty of guests just standing there while the staff was on the phone making a personal phone call guests were constantly being ignored it was very rude. Other guests would give up and walk away because staff would not even stay at front desk. Seems like the hotel needs to train staff to be more polite and also put more than one person on at a time  - Rooms: Small, staircase is too tiny to move luggage on, no elevator or staff offering to help you bring luggage upstairs- Continental Breakfast is nothing more than stale bagels, muffins, and other pasteries. *Main overall thing that could make the hotel better =staff

<Content>Great location for tourist/business/ better front desk help We have stayed here before and reservation was done by Sabina the GM. Liked the upgrades with the furniture but highly recommend a lighter lobby. Sabina was kind enough to send us a list of jazz places during her leave. I think though the staff has to improve with their directions and at times our hot water took time to come. 'Other than that see you again.

<Content>414 Inn Has it's pros and cons We recently spent 3 nights (April 1-4) at the 414 Inn. I can;t say that it was the best or worst place that we ever stayed. On balance, it was average. There are many good points, and some concerns we had. It depends how much you weigh they items to determine how you will feel about this place.PROSLocation. A great location right across from Restaurant Row and many theaters. A quiet street for Manahattan.Price: We paid $189 a night which was much less than other places in the area. Other cheaper places looked more shabby.Room: Nice bed and plasma TV.Lobby: Free internet service.CONSRoom: Shower had little pressure and heat. Not great when you've done a lot walking. Floors were uneven and carpet was older. Notr much light.Common Areas: Stairways were dangerously dark. Lobby area was too small for more than a few guests to have breakfast at the same time.Breakfast: Could have a better selection. Mini-bagels weren't very fresh.Staff: Staff wasn't overly friendly Usually in a small place like this you would expect charm coming from the staff. I have gotten more charm from larger hotels than at this place.All in all not a bad place, but lacks the true amenities of a greatbed and breakfast.

<Content>Really enjoyed my stay Really enjoyed my stay here. i'm very fussy and found everything to be be just fine. Very nice design and for me i found the room to be spacious compared to other new york hotels for the same price and location. i'll be booking my trip next year soon and will be staying again,loved the location and found the staff to be more friendly than any big chain. maybe this is recent but when i got back after a day out I was greeted by a complimentary glass of wine in the cosy lobby-nice touch! Spoke with memebers of staff who said they are about to redesign the lobby to give a more lounge feel - should be nice.this is not a gripe but I would like to have a more healthy/muesli/granola cereal choice for breakfast

<Content>Tiny rooms but clean and great location and price. My husband and I stayed here for one night in March to see a show and have dinner in the city without having to drive home afterwards. We had a ground floor room # 101- which was tiny- even by NYC standards, but it was very clean and the large flat screen tv on the wall was a fun touch. It was very noisy, we heard people walking through the hallway all night- the hotel needs to do something to deaden the sounds in the lobby. Carpet or rugs- or something on the walls maybe??? The location is great to take in dinner and a show all within walking distance. The price was great- $ 160 per night- and it included continental breakfast, coffee all night, cereal, mini bagels, and juices. Not a bad place for a night but I would be claustrophic in the room if I had to stay much longer. There wasn't even room for a chair to sit on instead on on the bed. I probably wouldn't go there again, but it was fun for a night.

<Content>Nice hotel very close to the Theatre District Stayed here for 8 days in early Feb. Very nice location - walking distance of 2-3 blocks to theatres. Also Times Square and the Blue line are in short walking distance.Rooms are of a good size, nicely decorated and we found the rooms very clean and housekeeping kept the rooms nice throughout our stay. Large safe in the room. Adequate storage space. Large flat screen TV in the room. Comfortable bed - it is 2 singles though. Bathroom was OK. The shower did not have much water pressure or heat but was adequate. Not enough hot water for a bath. Can get a bit noisy - our room was facing the front and in the morning, the traffic can be noisy - but I suspect that this is true for most places in NY. Bring your earplugs - we did and we slept ok.Breakfast was included - and was laid out in the small kitchen on the ground floor. No tea-making facilities in the room but you can use the kitchen anytime which was fine. Lots of eating places around the hotel and you are spoilt for choice.

<Content>Ugh, STAY AWAY unless you like having a disease * Sheets were filthy and stained with some sort of bodily fluid, and obviously not changed from last occupant(s). This led to the discovery that the king bed is 2 singles side by side. * Headboards was dirty and sticky to the touch.* Dust everywhere, and impossible to tell when the carpet was last vacuumed, if ever. * Rust in the bathroom. * Huge step down into ground floor room, which you cannot notice without the light being on. You have to be in the room to turn the light on, so catch 22. You could easily break an ankle.* No elevator.* Very noisy.* Management not just unhelpful but actually rude, and seem to think they are doing you a favour by letting you stay at their over-priced and dangerous rooms. Going to keep it relatively short, although I could continue the list for another page or two. You get the picture. I am not sure how most people have reviewed this place relatively positively. It was the worst place that I have ever stayed, even when compared to the place in LA when a gunfight went off outside my room.

<Content>414 was exactly what we needed My husband and I stayed at the 414 for 4 nights over the New Years week. We enjoyed its convenient location and small size. We arrived early in the morning and were able to leave our luggage in a corner of the lobby so that we could tour around for the day. When we arrived at check in our luggage had been moved to our room which was quite nice considering there are a lot of stairs. Our room was clean  comfortable though a bit small and was perfect since we did not come to NYC to stay in our room a lot. It was a great place to relax for a bit after walking, shopping and touring in the city. We would definitely consider staying here again!

<Content>Wonderful Little Place in the heart of New York City What a wonderful place to stay in New York City. It is out of the way of all the hustle and bustle but yet close enough to all the excitement. The room was a little on the small side but quite accurate for an enjoyable overnight stay. The bathroom was on the large side and easy to move around in. There was a little INTERNET area just inside the lobby, and they had a great Continental breakfast the next morning. The staff was very informative and a great help. I would definitely stay again at this great little out of the way hotel.

<Content>Perfect I stayed at the 414 over the New Year period with 4 friends. The atmosphere of this hotel is very relaxed and informal and the staff are more than willing to help, often brewing fresh coffee when we needed it, which was pretty often! You can help yourself to drinks from the small kitchen whenever you like. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and of course the location is great. Plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from if you don't want to go too far, but really close to Times Square. The actual road it's on is pretty quiet so that's a bonus. The only negative is that sometimes the water wasn't as hot as it could have been and you sometimes had to ask for the heating to be turned on - but these were not big problems. I would definitely stay there again, it made my stay very comfortable.

We had a top floor room which is not a problem if you are young  resonably fit. The staff were friendly  they even sent up a bottle of red wine on arrival which we thought was a nice touch.The breakfast was great (muffins, croissants, cereals, juices) although there was never quite enough seating room but we were happy to bring ours to our room.The hotel is in a great location, quiet street near Restaurant row  close enough to TImes Square. We only used the subway once.We will definitely consider this hotel when we are next in New York.

<Content>Absolute Gem Myself and my two girlfriends stayed here, from the 29th November till the 3rd December. I have to say the staff were polite and helpful. We were luckily put on the first floor just over reception, we had a twin room with a roll out bed. The room was clean and bright and the bathroom was spotless. To be honest we were on a shopping trip so the room was really messy each morning we left. But every evening on our return, the room was spotless, with fresh linen on the beds every single day. Each morning you could get fresh croissants, muffins, bagels, cereal, juices and tea or coffee, which I have to say was a lovely bonusI can't speak well enough of this hotel. It is a brilliant bargain in NYC and only a few steps away from Times Square, bus station and Rockefellar. We will without doubt be going back to this hotel!!!

After complaining about the cold I was told the heating would be turned on. Later the same day, no heating. I complained and another guest also complained. Heating was provided. After this bad start I found the 414 to be just right for our stay . The breakfast was adequate, free internet was provided and the staff were OK. The bathroom was fine, with a good shower but little enough water for a good bath. The location is ideal. I would stay there again

<Content>Can't wait to return! My husband and I called this place home for four wonderful nights. We arrived early and the hotel kindly monitored our luggage. We were told that our bags would be in our room when we returned at check in time. However, this was not the case but was not a huge issue or inconvenience. We were told we were going to be placed on the top floor in their second building because it would be quieter. We certainly found this to be the case. There is no elevator in this hotel so be prepared to work your calf muscles. We found the staff to be helpful and polite. The daytime clerk offered to call a car to drive us back to Newark Airport and watched our luggage until it was time to leave. This hotel was great! We are so happy we stayed here. We prefer quaint originality to a huge monstrosity of a hotel chain any day! The location was superb! You walk through Restaurant Row to get to anywhere you want to go. The distance to Times Square is very brief. We will definitely stay here again! Thanks for a great time!

<Content>Not Bad! We booked this hotel based on the TA reviews. Price was right at $199 per night plus $30 taxes. The location on 46th made it an easy walking distance to Times Square and not really a bad walk to anywhere else. One day we actually walked from the Metropolitan Museum all the way back to this hotel although we stopped several times. Walking much further than Rockefeller Center would be weather dependent however.Staff was reserved but friendly. We checked in early and had to leave baggage in the small lobby. It had been moved all the way to our 4th floor rooms when we came back. That was a nice touch since there is no elevator. Rooms were a little small but adequate and clean. We were in the front bldg but on the courtyard side and it was quiet. Morning breakfast was good with fresh baked goods. Lobby area is very small but had no problems with seating. On our last day there they arranged a car for transfer to LGA. I would stay here again because of the price advantage, location, and cleanliness. Just be prepared to do some stair climbing if on the 3rd or 4th floor.

<Content>It was alright I stayed at the 414 the 4 days prior to Thanksgiving. I live in London but I am an American and a New Yorker so I decided to treat myself to a stay in Manhattan to do some shopping and see friends. Before going I new this was a BB style hotel and was a walkup which normally is no problem but the week prior to going I twisted my knee so I called and asked to be moved to a lower floor possible the first floor. I was told since I paid a bargain price through a discount site I was not allowed to move below the 3rd floor (out of 4) unless I wanted to pay an extra ~拢30 a night. On top of that the woman who answered the phone also pointed out that if I had a bad knee I shouldn't have reserved a room in a hotel with no lift. If I had planned to twist my knee I would have taken that advice believe me! Since Hotels.com charges your card right away and this call was a few days prior to my going I really didn't have a choice but to stay in this hotel.Upon arrival I checked in and no one offered to help me carry my bags to the third floor when I returned to the desk to ask no one was there. Finally I got my bags up the 2 very steep flights of stairs I walked into the room to be pleasantly surprised by a clean if not sparse room with a beautiful bath and down comforter and pillows. A rather large flat screen TV was on the wall which was nice but there was no dresser into which I could un pack my clothing. There was a bed, 2 nightstands, a desk and chair but no dresser. After finding a luggage rack in the closet I put my bag on that realizing that I would be living out of it for 3 days. The location of this hotel is great for the theatres and restaurants. It is an easy walk to Times Square and any subway.The breakfasts were adequate and there is free internet access on one computer in the lobby. This was fine for me since I only needed to check my email. Overall the stay was ok for the price but I have to say that the customer service is lacking. The young woman that works the day shift on the front desk I found to be rude and extremely un-helpful so after the first couple of encounters I steered clear of her. Being a New Yorker I expect a certain amount of gruffness but this woman should find a new job.

It is a small hotel (22 rooms) so make your reservations early for prime travel dates-like Christmas time in NYC .Location, location, location! Next to Restaurant Row, a few blocks from Times Square and Radio City Music Hall to name a few nearby places to visit. The rooms are a nice size and clean.

<Content>Ok, in good location We stayed 2 nights on our way from San Fancisco back to Europe. Once you are over the shock of Manhatten hotel.prices I guess this hotel is not too bad. The room was small with a huge plasma telly. Our room was clean, though other guests seem to had encounters with arthropodic favourites. The guy at reception was with very few words. The bath was ok, though the water was only luke warm. The main plus for this place is the location, 2 min to restaurant row and less than 10 min to time square on foot. Also good, free internet access in lobby.

<Content>Everything we wanted We wanted location more than anything else and this hotel certainly provides that. Only 2 blocks from Times Square and on a really quiet street opposite a church meant it was as quiet as it can be in the middle of Manhattan. The rooms are bigger than average and ours was clean, light and airy. Comfy bed and large TV. The only potential negative I can think of is the lack of an elevator in the hotel and with the top floor being 3 flights of stairs I would advise anyone with mobility problems to make this clear at the time of booking.For anyone on a budget this should be first choice or very close.

<Content>Plain Fun. The hotel is located at the end of restaurant row in the theater district. It is small 20+ rooms, and there is NO elevator, just stairs up the five stories. The staff is wonderful and courteous. The room was basic, but had 2 standout features: a duvet bedspread(warm and soft) and a flatscreen TV as wide as the bed. The continental breakfast is served in the lobby, and has lots of choices. This hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and theaters. I would stay here again.

<Content>414 charming  We stayed at the 414 September 27 - October 1 2006. It was exactly what we had hoped and expected based on the posotive reviews from this website and a few more.We did not want to spend a huge amount of money for accomodations (because everything else is so expensive in NYC) but we did want something clean  comfy. Since there are no elevators we requested the first floor. Our room was small but exceptionally clean. The bathroom was actually quite large.Each room had a mini fridge which came in handy.A small, charming courtyard was right outside our room and we ate out there almost every morning and enjoyed a few beers and some wine  cheese after a long day of sightseeing.There is a small kitchenette in the lobby with a microwave, sink, fridge. We ate breakfast at the 414 every morning. Cereal, fresh croissants, fresh huge muffins, bagels, cream cheese, butter etc.coffee (wonderful!) juice, milk. I picked up fresh fruit from one of the several markets very close to the 414 to have at breakfast.Loved the down pillows on the bed. .....rare for any hotel to provide down pillows. Staff was very courteous.If you are looking for a large chain hotel feeling than the 414 is not for you. The 414 does have a very European feel. We loved the location, convenient to everything but a off the main drag a bit and also felt very safe.I would stay at this hotel again  recommend it.

I had researched dozens of hotels before reading about this small hotel in a travel magazine. It was perfect for us. We loved the location. We walked to Central Park, the Empire State Building, Times Square all the restaurants and the Broadway shows. The rooms are basic but clean. The staff is wonderful. They are helpful and friendly. Cereal, rolls, juice and coffee are served in the morning and there is a computer available in the lobby for customer use. This is not a luxury hotel and the price reflects that. There is no elevator and the stairs seem steep after a long day of touring. However, if you are looking for good value in a convenient, safe neighborhood, check 414 out. Oh, and Amy's Bread is right down the street. This will become a habit.

<Content>Good enough, but will never go back... Just returned from a 5 night stay at the 414 and I was very disappointed after having read all of the great reviews here. First impression based on the outside of the building was that this was going to be a great place but I was wrong. The gentleman who checked us in was very nice and I will say all the staff was friendly and helpful. We were given room 204 which was in the front building right above the reception area and facing the street. The halls in the building are depressing. Dark gray or black carpet and the walls were painted a very, very dark purple if I had to guess. I was so dark it was hard to tell. The room at first glance though seemed nice. It was a pale yellow with 2 twin beds since this was a mother daughter trip! Upon looking closer though the room was in desperate need of updating. Scuff marks on the walls, chippy paint on the window sills, carpets could use a deep clean. In the bathroom on the ceiling there was a huge place where there had been a leak that was patched but it was brown and nasty looking and could stand to be painted over. Also there was a place on walls near the ceiling where paint was bubbling off the wall. It almost looked like masking tape had been put on there and painted over and now it was peeling off. Towels I could tell were clean but they sometimes had stains on them. Aside from those issues the bathroom was clean. bathtub, sink, and toilet were cleaned good daily. We had a window air conditioner which ran nonstop but never fully cooled the room down. It blew right into a piece of furniture that the old tv's used to be in but haven't been removed from the rooms yet. We tried to move it a bit to get some air going but due to the size of the room there was nowhere to move it to so we had to make due. We had nice fluffy comforters but only slept with a sheet since the room was so hot. And you couldn't open the windows and try sleeping since the street noise was horrible. I expected some noise but this was rediculous. I finally bought some ear plugs so I could sleep. Also with being right above reception area we heard the front door SLAM shut any time someone came in. Not only did it make the loud noise it also vibrated the beds we were in. also we could feel the people next door stomping around and hear other people from their rooms through the vents in the bathroom. If you kept the bathroom door shut that seemed to help. The beds were nice, clean, and very comfortable. Just all the noise and bumps in the night made it sometimes very hard to sleep. Breakfast served downstairs was always fresh but I warn people to stay away from the coffee. It was SO strong. I had to try and dilute it with water but I finally ended up going to starbucks for my coffee every morning. Several times they didn't even have any coffee. Once it ran out they took their time making more. I will say that the 414 is in a great location near restaurant row and times square and I never felt unsafe in the nighborhood. Also they had nice clean beds. Those are the only good comments I can write. From what I've heard the front building will undergo renovations soon and if I had stayed in the back building which has been redone things might have been different. I picked this place because of the reviews and because I wanted to stay somewhere small and cozy, but in the future when I go back to NYC I am going back to the big, well known, crowded hotels not the 414.

<Content>in retrospect - not bad! We had a split stay at this hotel and on first arriving I was a bit disappointed. Somehow it wasn't quite as charming as I had read about in these reviews. It looks shabby and needs a bit of a makeover.We were on the ground floor on both occasions, in two different rooms across from each other. The second room seemed much better (there was a very odd smell in the first one sometimes). The beds are clean and comfortable; the rooms were stifling at times; the breakfast adequate and the staff generally helpful and very pleasant. One member of staff seemed to be very new and as a result on more than one occasion was unhelpful e.g. he tried to tell me that the message flashing button on the phone was due to the weather. When I explained that we were expecting a message, he could not advise us how to access the message. As a consequence we had to wait 6 hours until someone else came on duty. By this time it was 11.00pm and we could not reply. That was our only disappointment however.There are plenty of restaurants around- all very reasonable. We liked 'Yum-yums' on 9the Ave (turn right at the lights) and a good Mexican on 9th (to the left at the lights, on a corner a couple of blocks up).We were able to walk to the main attractions- 414 is in a fabulous place. Overall, good value for money.

<Content>Good Low Gloss Hotel in High Rent New York Hotel 414 is definitely a low gloss hotel, not for those who require a smooth shiny surface in their hotels. I found it pleasant, ideally situated and comfortable enough, once I climbed the 3 flights of stairs to my room (getting exercise on your vacation is a good thing). And apparently $150 per night is a steal in New York. I'm guessing that the building was one of the residential brownstones on the block that got converted to hotel/bed and breakfast status (the sign outside the place said bed and breakfast).I particularly appreciate hotels that are in quieter, more residential areas near the center of town. Hotel 414 fit this perfectly, being sited on a quiet residential street a couple of blocks west of the Theatre District and a few more minutes' walk to Times Square. 9th Avenue, the commercial street around the corner, has lots of moderately priced restaurants and bakeries, and a bus line (the nearest subway station is on 8th).The bed was comfortable, the room had enough lighting but was dark enough at night, there was that huge TV (there was also the armoire for the previous TV, which nobody had yet bothered to remove!) The air conditioning worked and wasn't excessively noisy. The room was kept clean and I was too busy huffing and puffling on the (narrow) stairway to notice its condition. As someone who likes baths, the bathtub was awfully shallow. The breakfast looked pretty lame to me--stale pastries in a city full of wonderful bakeries, so I skipped it. The lobby was minimal but it did have a free internet connected computer, a helpful amenity for those of us who don't travel with laptops.

<Content>Great little hotel! The hotel is small and friendly and in a great location - only 5-10 minutes walk from Times Square and subway stations and right on top of loads of restaurants, yet far enough off the main roads to be quiet enough to get some sleep. There is no elevator, which may be a pain if you have large cases, but the friendly staff offered to help us with our bags. Our room was a good size and so was the bathroom. Everything was clean and the bed was nice and comfy. The large flat screen TV on the wall was a nice touch, and a mini fridge in the room was handy to keep cool drinks on hand. The complimentary breakfast each morning was simple, with cereal, fresh croissants and bagels etc. but all you need to start you off for the day. Overall, we were really pleased with the hotel and would definitely recommend others to give it a go if you're happy with a simple, informal base to explore New York

<Content>great location, great price for NYC This hotel was 1 block from restaurant row  2 blocks from the theater district plus it averaged $159 per night. A continental breakfast was also included at that price. No other place I found could even come close. I thought there were a few cosmetic things (paint, for example) that could be done but overall, it was a great place to stay.

<Content>Amazing Little Hotel! We couldn't have found a place better than the 414 Inn to stay! Located in a residential neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, it is within walking distance to nearly everything. We were a few blocks from Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, almost everything! There are plenty of places to eat and shop in the area too!The staff are most helpful, are available 24 hours a day, give great directions, and have great advice for sightseeing and places to eat. The rooms are fabulous (ours was on the 4th floor), extremely comfortable, and always kept clean. My only note to travelers is that if you cannot go up and down stairs, request a first floor room when making your reservation, as the hotel does not have an elevator. Staying at this little bed and breakfast was one of the best decisions of our entire trip and we will, most definitely, return to this hotel if we ever visit NYC again.

<Content>On the Way Down We got the idea of staying at the 414 Inn in NYC from this site. Most of the comments were comfortable, quiet, clean with a European flair. We could still see a lot of this, but have to report that it is on its way down and becomming seedy. We believe that this is because the ideas might have been in the brain of the hotel manager, Mike, and he died suddelnly a few months ago. One can see the changes. The carpets are showing dirt, the court yard. though still pleasant. has dead plants and the lobby, just turning shappy. I hope someone quickly comes in as it could easily still be turned around.

<Content>Great Find...But Watch the Steps! This little hotel is a glorified BB with some nice accoutrements such as enormous plasma TVs, spacious, well-lit rooms, a quiet interior courtyard and nicely refurbished bath. We did not stay for breakfast, but the baked goodies were delivered in from a local bakery just as we were checking out around 7 to catch a train. The lobby/dining area is a little bizarrely furnished and was vaguely reminiscent of a dorm room filled with cubes and tables and chairs that would have seemed ultramodern about 15 years ago. The reception was about what one would expect for NY...a little brusque, but not at all unfriendly (there is a difference). The only caveat I would give is that the rooms lie primarily in a building separated from the reception area by a small courtyard, and, to reach the rooms, one must climb a very narrow stairway. This is not a not a problem if one doesn't have much luggage (and we had very little), but I was reminded of the flat in Barefoot in the Park to which most people arrive winded from the climb. Not for the infirm or disabled!The courtyard would be a lovely spot to have a glass of wine or your morning nosh. The room was so quiet that I had trouble sleeping from the LACK of noise :-)Located steps from the Theater District, we had dinner at a great Italian spot Southwest 44 (on, you guessed it, the SW corner of 9th Ave and 44th St., about 2 short blocks from the Inn). It's a real neighborhood place with very reasonably priced food that is served in portions enough to satisfy even the most ravenous appetite. My mother had a lobster ravioli that was simply out of this world, and I had bowtie pasta with cavetelli, spinch, garlic and scallops. Delicious. The original proprietor who is probably in his 80s still greets customers. The first time we went here was with a theater friend who introduced us to Jeff Goldblum and other regulars who were sitting next to us right up front.

<Content>We'll All Miss Mike I stayed at 414 in December 2005 and January 2006, and loved this darling little hotel, not least of all because of Mike and his caring attitude, NY know-how, and great service. Mike extended himself so beautifully for the hotel guests, and did so much to enhance my visit. For instance, in January my plane got in late to JFK and the freezing rain was slowing the train into the city. I had an 8:00 curtain to see my dear mother's friend in her closing theater performance. I called Mike from the depot, and he arranged a car to pick me up just in time to get to the theatre. At the Champagne reception for the closing show, the stage director gave me a set piece (painting) to take home, and Mike helped me find a place close by to wrap it carefully and mail it home. Mike helped me find good restaurants and gave me directions to so many places. One late night I came back to the hotel and Mike was there looking very sad. He'd had news that his father was very ill. I talked and prayed with him and he shared his stories with me. I was so saddened to hear recently that Mike passed away in May of this year. I know that many of your patrons will find this a great loss, but I know that Jorje and the rest will keep up his great tradition of service. Next time I stay at 414, I hope to see a photo orsomething of him in the lobby or above the desk. In fact, I'd like to contribute to a plaque in his honor.Thanks, 414, for having Mike at your hotel. Be blessed.Sincerely,Dorothy W.Alabama

<Content>414....A brilliant find! Stayed at the 414 hotel for 4 nights from the 31st May onwards. Choose the hotel due to the excellent reviews given on trip advisor. I was not disappointed! Hotel clean, staff friendly (especially Jessica), nice breakfast and most importantly Fab location! Would not hesitate in returning there. The bedroom overlooked the courtyard and was peaceful at night. On a sad note, after reading all the positive reviews on Mike it was sad to hear he had passed away.

<Content>Gem in NYC I stayed in NYC with my sister May 4-8. We did extensive research online and readmany, many different reviews. We found that the 414 Hotel had everything we were looking for, including a fantastic price of 159/weekday, 169/weekend. The rooms were very clean and modern. The large flat screen TV mounted to the wall, the refrigerator in the room, modern furnishings, free internet access in lobby, friendly staff, free continental breakfast that kept us full till noon every day, and the serene courtyard are just a few reasons why we will return to this hotel. We felt very safe as two women in our thirtys walking around the neighborhood. We went to see Three Days of Rain during our stay and we walked about 5 minutes to get to this theater, although cabs are readily available from the hotel entrance. NYC is such an energetic, vibrant city to visit, and the 414 met all of our needs. I would recommend booking early, (21 rooms go quickly) and I would request a room in the back building on the lower floor. (the building closer to the street may be noisier). The hotel has 4 floors and no elevator, this was a minor inconvenience and we preferred the lower room rate to carrying our luggage up a few stairs. (we came to New York prepared to walk and the extra money we saved with the room rate we went shopping with.) We will look forward to our next visit at the 414!

<Content>Nice little hotel My girlfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of April. It is in a great location, only 5 minutes walk to all the restaurants and about 10 to Times Square. The rooms are not very big but that wasn't a problem as we did not come to New York to stay in our room. The bed was comfortable and there is a widescreen plasma tv on the wall with plenty of cable channels. Continental breakfast is included but this is pretty basic. You eat in a very small dining area close to the reception. There is a small kitchen where you can help yourself to cookies, muffins, bagels and croissants etc. There is also a kettle if you want tea or coffee and a selection of fruit juices. The receptionists were helpful but it was only Mike who seemed to go out of his way to help you and recommend places to eat and also to give directions. There is a computer next to the dining area if you need to use the internet and this is free to use. The bedrooms were cleaned daily and this was done to a high standard. We had no complaints about this. The hotel was quiet and we were never disturbed during the night.  We both recommend this hotel and if we return to New York we will stay here again.

<Content>A peacefull oasis in a mad city I was in New york from the 4 to the 8 of May and stayed at the 414, I, like most others booked this hotel because of reviews on trip advisor. I had been to New York a few years ago and stayed at the Crown Plaza on Times Square, my biggest memory of that time, was the constant noise in the bedroom at night, with Police cars and fire engine claxtons going on all through the night. Not so the 414, the street was not too busy, and when you sat in the courtyard you could have been a million miles from the city. As far as the staff are concerned, they where so friendly and helpfull, again, especially Mike. If you are looking for a small hotel that makes you feel as if you are staying with family, rather than a glass and concrete highrise, this is for you. Good value, clean rooms, nice staff and a peacefull courtyard what more can you ask for. And I have not even mentioned the continental breakfast, the above average size of the bedrooms, the 43 Plasma screen in the rooms, the 2 min. walk to Resturaunt row ( Which Mike will keep you right on where to eat.), or the 10 min walk to Times square. All in all a little Gem in these days of fast foods, fast cars etc, it was nice to feel welcome and wanted. Keep it up Mike, and the rest of the staff at 414, it proves good service does pay.

It is a charming hotel like the hotels in Europe! They were very friendly, especialy Micheal he will help you with anything you need. The rest of the staff is just as nice you can't go wrong. Their website is (--) their e-mail adress is (--) They have a continental breakfast like in Europe! The rooms are clean and nice. There are stairs, but they have some rooms on the ground floor, there is no elevator. It is a beautiful hotel in a crazy, and vivacious city like New York! Give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised! I will be coming back again. So if you prefer quiet , european style, with great service this is the hotel for you. If you have any questions let me know.

<Content>Would absolutely stay again!!! My daughter and I stayed at the 414 Inn from April 17-20 and it was great. The price fit my budget which is hard to find in NYC. My daughter described the room as very feng shui. It was very clean and offered all the necessities. The pillows were very comfortable and the service was great. I didn't realize when I booked the room that they offered a continental breakfast in the morning so that was a nice surprise. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The location was very convenient. We had wanted to stay somewhere that gave us a NYC feel without being too big and commercial. At the 414 we definitely achieved that goal and we can't wait to go again.

The location is superb with a wealth of resturants and pubs only meters away.

Clearly one of the best buys in the city.

<Content>Location, Location, Location Located on Restaurant Row and near the major theaters, this boutique hotel has nicely furnished rooms (new plasma TV's)at an incredibly good price. Mike at the front desk is exceptionally helpful with restaurants and touring. Heater controls were hard to locate and there was little info available on use of phones, etc. but these were small oversights for such a comfortable stay. We had three rooms for five days (in both of the hotel's two buildings) and everyone was content. Would return in a minute.

We stayed only one night but it was very nice. Mike is extremely knowledgeable and very friendly/helpful. We recommend this cute place to anyone looking for great location, nice people and good size room with nice amenities. Breakfast in the morning is a nice added touch with good coffee and bagels, etc. I'll stay again when in NYC and will recommend to friends and family. Oh, the big screen TV in our room was a nice touch too. My only negative feedback is that there are no elevators/lift for luggage and dragging 3 heavy bags up 2 flights was a little tough.

<Content>Very pleasant stay My husband and I stayed at the 414 for 5 days in January and we were very pleased. I did my homework in checking out reviews for New York City hotels in this vicinity and all the positive reviews I read on the 414 were correct. It was a quaint little inn - the room was a good size, with very decent size bathroom - all very clean. And the bed was about the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Coffee, juice, rolls, bagels etc. out in the lobby in the morning were very nice. And the front desk was always very helpful and accommodating. And you really can't beat the location - so convenient (walking distance) to so much, especially the theatre district and Times Square. And being on Restaurant Row was great, espcially for late night dinners and entertainment. The 414 and New York City was fabulous. We can't wait to go back.

<Content>Great Location and Service We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the 414 and could not fault the hotel/BB for price, location and more importantly the great service provided by Mike and Jessica. Mike will give you all the local knowledge you need! As stated by most reviewers you are right on restaurant row and an easy walk through the theatre district to Times Square so you can not be better placed to enjoy those areas or get uptown or downtown. The room was comfortable, the internet connection in the foyer was partcularly useful, and the bagels and croissants at breakfast were great. We would definitely consider staying here again - a great base to explore Manhattan.

<Content>Lovely little hotel Myself and a friend stayed at the 414 hotel for 5 nights in January and it was lovely! The hotel is very cosy and warm and our twin room was nice and spacious with really comfortable beds. The ensuite bathroom was also large and clean with a large mirror and they changed our towels every day. There was also a large mirror in the room, along with an ironing board, safe, TV etc. We had to ask for a hairdryer but they provided one with no questions asked. The hotel is in a great location, 2 blocks from Time square and just off restaurant row where it was easy to jump in a cab to go up or downtown. The subway at time square is pretty close too! The hotel also provided a nice breakfast of coffee, juice, bagels, croissants etc which was lovely and there were also some great diners to go for breakfast close by as well as some great restaurants. Becco was our favourite. The staff were all really friendly especially the owner and Jessica and made us feel very welcome!We loved New York and would defintely go back to the 414 - its not luxury but its all you need and great if you are on a budget! PS Top of the rock at the rockafeller centre is amazing and in our opinion better views than the empire state building!

<Content>Great location, Great Host Hotel is two blocks from Times Square and is accessible to the Subway. The hotel owner provided me with directions and was very king throughout my stay. The hotel is a converted apartment building and does not have an elevator. Rooms are reasonably priced and I would recommend it to anyone who is visiting the city that does not want to spend a fortune on the hotel.

<Content>Excellent value for money! A real gem What a gem!First of all: the location, really near to Times Square, says it all.Apart from that, my room was very spacious, tidy, very well kept and with a huge king-size bed.There is a big drawback, however: there is no lift, and so being on the 4th floor could be quite a drag.The hall is very tiny as well, but U got free Internet, and the staff is more than friendly and helpful.I was there last august, and got a good deal, 150$ per night, so I guess it's one of the best values for money U can get in NY

<Content>Did we stay in the same place? We live in NYC, actually very near this place, and stayed for two nights because we had guests in town. We thought it would be fun to check in someplace nearby and let them have our apartment to themselves. We spent the rest of their stay not letting them know what a sacrifice we were making.This place was not nearly clean enough (the rug needed a good vacuuming, especially around the edges, the bathroom needed a really good scrub), the furniture was cheap and rickety (the bed was a simple metal frame), the TV reception was lousy, there was a cheap mini-fridge (brown - no attempt to have it blend in with the dreary gray of the rest of the room) just sitting on the floor, tiles were missing in the bathroom, the shower pressure was pathetic, the noise from the hallway (no elevator, and you could hear every step on the stairs) was very loud, the padded headboard was filthy, the heating was inadequate (there was a cheap plug-in heater - scary), I could go on and on. This place is not being maintained properly.And the price? One could say it was cheap by NYC standards ($230 a night!), but we felt very ripped off.Please, be adventurous, and find someplace better than here to stay (and don't be fooled by the lobby, which is much nicer than the rooms).

<Content>Miracle on 46th Street God blessed me with a reservation at 414. It is simply a darling and comfortable place. It is where fine meets affordable, and is a wonderful place to stay for anyone looking to be close to theater, Restaurant Row, Times Square, etc. It is safe, picturesque, clean, comfortable, and an absolute delight. I had prayed for a good, affordable place to stay during the Christmas rush of December, and finally (on my birthday!) 414 called, having kindly put me on a waiting list some days before, to let me know I could have reservations. I said, Thank You, Lord Jesus! What a relief and surprise that was for me. I enjoyed my stay a lot, and the concierges (particularly Michael) were helpful and friendly. Michael helped me with restaurant choices and getting a car to the airport. I was very impressed and have already made reservations to go back again. D. W.

<Content>A delightful stay at 414 We recently spent 3 nights at the 414 Hotel on West 46th St. Our room was very clean with ample room. The bathroom was spotless and good sized. We were in the back building, giving us a quiet location. The hotel is among many small restaurants serving different types of food. It is also conveniently located to theaters in the Times Square area. Working at the front desk were Jessica and Mike. Both were extremely helpful and friendly. While the breakfast was not fancy, the cereal, croissants, muffins, sweet rolls, juice and coffee were fresh daily. We would definitely consider staying at the 414 Hotel on future visits to New York City.

<Content>Quiet, quaint, right in the middle of it all- 414 Hotel Is a Jewel in Manhattan My family and I spent 4 wonderful nights at this well run, made you feel at home lodging. It is located in the middle of Restuarant row, with very easy access to shows, events, Times Square, Central Park, etc. Questions about where to go and what to do? Just ask, the staff is ALWAYS there, ready to assist. The courtyard is a very nice touch, as is the nice selection for breakfast. We met guests from all parts of the world. If you want a safe, unique and comfortable place to stay, we recommend it highly!

<Content>Great Location, Excellent Personal Service, Good Value This was our first trip to New York in many years. We were travelling with friends who selected this hotel due to the low cost and the location to Times Square and Restaurant Row. We found the hotel staff very professional and efficient. They really took great care of us and make us all feel very welcome. Mike especially was most helpful and really made our stay a memorable experience. He was even able to obtain reservations for us on Saturday night at a very popular restaurant on restaurant row. Really a nice feat and we had a wonderful time. The TV could use a few more channels, I had difficulty in picking up the local CBS station which was a little frustrating since it is only a few blocks away. However, we were not in NY to watch TV. We found the rooms to be efficient, clean and more than adequate for the time we spent there. The breakfast left a little to be desired as the pastries seemed to be a little old. However, the coffee and juice selection was good and there are plenty of places to eat within a couple of blocks. We will most likely stay there again for future visits. This place is small and does book up pretty quickly.

The location is fabulous (only 4 blocks from Times Square) and situated along Restaurant Row.

<Content>Great find in central Manhattan My husband and I stayed two nights in this hotel in late August. We were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room, the huge bathroom (for NYC), the great breakfast, and the computer available in the lobby with free internet. The rooms were pretty nicely done; modern furniture but a little worn. We had a view of the little courtyard, which was very nice and quiet, which is rare in NYC.The street it was on was nice and quiet, with plenty of restaurants and Times Square just two blocks away. It was also only 4 blocks from the bus terminal, which was very convenient.Our only issue was that the AC switch was broken, so it was impossible to turn off. We phoned the front desk for help and about an hour later someone came with plyers and adjusted the temperature for us. It was overall a nice place to stay for the money relative to some others in New York, and I would stay again.

<Content>Great Inn / Awesome location My wife and I stayed at the 414 Inn on our first ever trip to Manhattan in September. First and foremost, the location is outstanding! Located in Mid-town West on restaurant row, everything you need is within walking distance (and if you don't walk, they'll call you a cab or a car if you need to go to the airport - we used CarmelCar - $45 will get you to JFK). Many tourist sights are a few blocks away...Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Broadway, etc. The hotel itself is nice. The room was small yet very clean and quiet. It had the amenities of a regular hotel minus room service, but why would you want room service when every type of restaurant is a short walk? The staff was friendly, especially Michael. The continental breakfast was adequate. Don't expect BB cooking, but when we were on our way out sight-seeing, we certainly appreciated the cereal, juice, muffins, etc. that were provided. Overall, we have fond memories of the 414 Inn and would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Manhattan.

<Content>Wonderful little place!! I absolutely adore this place. It was mine and my husband's first time in NYC. We weren't sure what to expect. We arrived prior to check in and they graciously allowed us to store our luggage in the lobby while we began discovering the city. They were helpful anytime we had questions. Our room was more than we could have expected for the price. It was spacious with a huge bathroom. The room was decorated simply with a modern flare. The location is PERFECT! We were able to walk everywhere. Five minutes and your in the dead center of Times Square. We are actually returning to NYC for New Year's Eve and have already rebooked this great place!

<Content>Decent but won't stay again The 414 Inn. Advantages: the room was quiet; the location was great; the staff was friendly; and the room, at around $200 a night mid-week, was among the more inexpensive options available. Disadvantages: no elevator, no hair dryer, poor television reception, dingy carpet, no soap dish; no fresh air (I could not keep the windows open); no hotel internet connection; poor water pressure in the shower (a light trickle). The furniture was simple but acceptable. I was not impressed with the pastries offered in the continental breakfast  so went across the street to the bakery, which provides a free newspaper with the purchase of one of many delicious muffins available. I wouldn't want to be on an upper floor of this hotel in a fire.Next time I come to Manhattan, I will trade the 414's great location for a better quality room farther from Times Square.

<Content>Good Location, Reasonable Price We stayed here for 4 nights in August, 2005 and were very happy with our stay. We are Hoosier folk and after reading reviews for other inexpensive (by NYC standards, not Indiana's!) hotels, I was prepared for a depressing shoebox, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was good sized for 2 people, with a large bathroom. The furnishings were clean, modern, and tasteful. The worst thing was our air conditioner, which was loud and with controls which were hard to adjust. This is really two buildings separated by a courtyard. Our room was in the back half: so we had to walk outside through the courtyard to get to our room, which might be a problem in rain or snow, but we had no problems with noise. It is a small hotel, so the staff has a personal feel and they were friendly and attentive. The continental breakfast was ordinary but sufficient: good croissants, bagels, orange juice, cereal. There is an Internet connected computer in the lobby for guests use to check e-mail or look up reviews, etc. The best feature is the location so close to the theater district. We went to 3 Broadway shows in 4 nights and they were all within easy walking distance. There are so many restaurants nearby that you get tired of the sidewalk hucksters trying to get you to stop at their restaurant. There is a comedy club practically across the street, a dry cleaners a half-block away, etc. The subway is not too close, about 6 blocks. All in all, I would be happy to come back here and look forward to our next visit.

<Content>414 Hotel is the worst accomodation experience of my life. I am extremely upset with the service provided at the 414 Hotel, and it took 6 weeks of follow up after the visit before Expedia did anything.This was the worst hotel experience in my life. My wife and I were visiting New York for hospital visits, and I booked 2 nights in this hotel via Expedia in order that my wife should have a more homely feel and be more relaxed before some medical tests and procedures. We arrived at about 9.45 pm on August 9, 2005 and elected to check in before finding a restaurant to eat at. We had called the hotel to advise that we would be arriving at about that time. I will start with complaints that will disgust all future occupants before dealing with the hotel鈥檚 dreadful behaviour.The following is based upon notes that I took at various times during the ordeal that we suffered, and is not exhaustive of the complaints that we have.I note a limited sample of the problems that of this hotel.路The bathroom had a revoltingly rusty radiator, which looked like it was falling apart. 路The bed sheets were stained and filthy. We had to request replacement sheets which were left for us to put on the bed ourselves.路The so called king size bed is simply 2 single beds pushed together.路The headboard affixed to the wall was filthy and did not appear to have been dusted in months.路There were holes in the wall of the room. 路There is a large step before descending into the room, which is dangerous and caused me to trip several times.路Neither the bathroom light nor the fan were working upon our arrival in the room. Only 2 of the 3 bulbs in the external area were working as well, so there was little light going into the bathroom, and the door therefore had to remain open. It is quite disgusting that my wife and I had to use the toilet facilities with the door open to the main room because of the lack of light. They repaired it some time during the day of August 10 whilst we were at the hospital, together with the non working bulb in the external sink area.路There is no working fan in the bathroom.路The safe in the room did not work due to a low battery and some of our valuables had to be left at risk. This was also repaired some time during the next day.Then our suffering started. I unloaded the car, and then parked it at the advertised parking, which is actually that of another hotel, and 4 blocks North and 1 block West. It has nothing to do with the 414 Hotel and can hardly be described as convenient.I mentioned the bathroom light problem to the receptionist who came to have a look. She claimed that she could not fix the light until a handyman would arrive sometime after midnight. As we had to rise at 6.30 am to get to the medical appointment, we said that we could not stay up until after midnight. In passing, she then mentioned that we should not unpack because we would have to move rooms the next day. We were surprised to hear this, and she said that we could have all our stuff packed up and the hotel staff would move it for us. We advised that this was outrageous. We had just traveled 10 hours, had to be up early and were to be in a hospital all of the next day, and that we were not going to spend any of time unpacking and then packing up again before the noon check out for the hotel鈥檚 convenience. This was the first we had heard of this, and would not have agreed to come to the hotel if we had been told. We were only going to be there for 2 nights. We asked her to call her manager and tell her this whilst we waited in our room.The receptionist called us back from the front desk and told us that she had spoken to the manager and that we had to move. She advised that we could check out now if we were not happy. At 10.30 p.m. we were not inclined to go looking for another hotel in Manhattan, especially when the car was parked some distance away, and she said she could not promise any refund since Expedia had received payment in full and they had no access to such monies. I then demanded that the manager actually speak to us, as we had originally requested. I called Expedia at the same time and their call desk said they would call the hotel to find out what was going on and call me back. A few minutes later, Expedia called my mobile telephone, whilst the manager (Sakima Karima) contemporaneously called the room. The manager advised us that we would have to move, that Expedia was a discount hotel provider and therefore those who paid more had precedence over us. She again advised us that if we did not like it, we could check out. She would even help us find another hotel on the next day. This again missed the point that as we were at the hospital all day, we would be unable to change hotels or rooms to accommodate their whim. I advised that I was not aware that Expedia was a discount provider, and the price paid was irrelevant to the level of service to be provided. A decent level of service should be provided to all. I was absolutely furious, and this conversation went backwards and forwards for 10 minutes, when she advised me that she ran a wonderful hotel and they had just received another star. She threatened that if we did not pack our belongings before heading for the hospital, then she would arrange for our belongings to be packed up by the hotel staff. It was only when I advised that I would be making our views known as to the level of service to the Expedia site, the tourism ministry and warn anyone else to stay away that she claimed that she had wanted to tell me that she would do her best to keep us in the room and that I should leave my mobile number with the front desk in the morning. She also claimed that she had told Expedia representatives a few weeks ago that she had the right to move guests around and blamed Expedia for the situation. She claimed to have the same problems with a website called hotels.com.I then picked up the call on my mobile telephone from Expedia who said that she had found out that the hotel could legally move us from the room because the hotel had apparently upgraded our room. I must admit, this was not something of which we were aware of until this point, and we had not requested an upgrade. The logic was that the hotel had a duty only to provide a room at the level booked, and if they upgraded, then they could reduce the grade thereafter at their discretion. The upgrade appeared to solely relate to a king size bed in the room. The 鈥渒ing size鈥?bed was actually 2 single beds pushed together! Expedia advised that all they could do was to request that a case manager open a file and that they would be in touch. This did not happen and I had to call them several times and spend several hours on hold whilst it went to 6 different Expediaites. I also mentioned that I felt a full refund would be appropriate to Expedia..We had to forego dinner that evening whilst dealing with this nonsense because it was too late to go out after these calls. Not exactly the stress reducing and restful evening that we had planned and wanted after a whole day traveling.The next day, we left for the hospital at 6.55 am and whilst my wife was in a medical appointment at about 9 a.m., I received a call from the manager advising that we would not have our belongings packed up and moved, and she would allow us to stay in the room. Due to the threats against our belongings my wife had not felt comfortable enough to unpack. The medical situation was stressful enough without this behaviour by the hotel, and made my wife unable to relax, and she slept only fitfully in spite of being exhausted. The manager also advised me during this call at approximately 9 a.m. that she had faxed a letter to Expedia prior to our stay advising you to tell us that we would be moved. This has not be proven to be true to this date, and several managers have continually lied to Expedia representatives in the past 6 weeks.This attitude alone and the extra stress and upset for my wife would have been bad enough by itself yet this hotel's facilities are also a disgrace.

<Content>Mikes' the man!! We arrived at the hotel after an horrendous arrival at Newark Airport. We had booked transport through Super Shuttle to the hotel. If you like being shouted at by a driver who does 70mph with two fingers on the wheel whilst talking to base then use these guys. They are absolutely awful.However the staff at 414 made up for this. We had arrived from C Rica and my back was playing up. Our room we were told was on the 4th floor with no elevator!!After a bit of rearranging we were given 101 on the ground floor! Thanks.We had in all the rush at the airport left a small bag on the shuttle. Mike and the staff went out of their way to recover this for us but Super Shuttle being what they are we eventually had to go to Queens by train to get it back!!But this hotel and it's staff were really very helpful. A small friendly hotel, not luxury but clean,breakfast eat all you like and a great little kitchenout of hours! Remote didn't work the tele.But hey we wern't there to watch tele.!! Highly recommended.DONT USE SUPER SHUTTLE!!!!!!

<Content>Loved this place I arrived at the hotel around 8:30pm, and was concerned about the reservation being cancelled. There was no problem at all with the late arrival. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. When I got to my room, the air conditioning was already turned on. The room was much bigger than I expected. The bathroom was quite large in size also. There was also a refrigerator in the room. One morning we left some money out for the maid intending for it to be a tip, and to our surprise, it was still there when we got back to our room. Thee location is ideal. Just a few blocks away from several major attractions. I felt totally safe in this neighborhood, compared to other places where there is gun shots in the front windows! The courtyard in this place is quaint, and a nice change of pace to see greenery in the city. There is no noise from the city at all in this hotel! I was also pleased with the breakfast. There was not only juice and muffins, but also had cereals and fruits and bagels to go with, I guess an expanded Continental breakfast. I am planning to stay again at this place when I come back! I would highly recommend it to all!!! Another plus for this place is they will hold your luggage for free for you after you check out if you want to go walk around the city some more, most other places will charge for this.

<Content>Good location I stayed in this small hotel for a night in the last week of July. Since it was a Sunday I got to pay USD 99 for the night (from hotels.com). Customer service is okay. I arrived at the hotel in the afternoon and since the check-in time is 3 PM I was asked to keep my bags with the staff. When I came back at 11 PM I saw that my room was ready (with the A/C on at full blast, imp in July) and my bags were in my room. The lady at the frontdesk in the afternoon was a little on the unwelcoming side, i.e., she didn't receive me with the kind of attitude you usually see in hotel receptionists (though not rude). However, when I checked in at night a different person was there and he was good. He even told me that I could have free continental breakfast tomorrow morning from 7-10 AM. Regarding the hotel itself, it is a townhouse sort of building converted to a hotel. You could see apartments all around the streets. The hotel is located in the hell's kitchen area of Midtown West. This is an older part of the town. The hotel is very close to Times Square and other prime locations (Broadway, Empire State, Macy's). For the location I would give this hotel 5 stars. You can walk from the hotel to most of the major attractions in couple of minutes. The hotel room was nice; it had all amenities except a fridge and coffee maker. I guess you don't need a coffee maker since you get free cofee in the morning with your breakfast. The bathroom was huge!! I liked that a lot. The only thing I didn't like was the bed. Also, one of the windows near the fire escape didn't lock.I would highly recommend this hotel for its location, however, if you have some time you can get a 4*/3* hotel in Midtown West and Midtown East for USD 120-140 from priceline. If you get a good deal on this hotel and are expected to spend most of your time out of your room then go for it. A caution the street leading to the hotel appears deserted at late night. If you want to stay in the richer part of midtown stay on the east side.

<Content>Need help? 414 hotel Provides Every Service Dear friends and interested parties,I highly recommend without reservation staying at the 414 Hotel.I had a large problem with my visa application that the professional staff at the 414 HOtel located at 414 West 46th street , NY, NY 10036 resolved for me. They made numerous faxes on my behalf, phone calls, let me use their msn instant messenger and internet to get information from another country immediately to meet the application deadline.Despite what seemed an insurmountable problem, everything was resolved due to the courteous , helpful, caring service of the management and staff of 414 Hotel.The rooms are also very nice with all the amenities. There is a lovely patio, too. The location is ideal woth good good restaurants in the area, food store nearby, close to madison square Gardens (I walked from there to the hotel) .If you stay at 414 Hotel, you have a friend in New York City, if something goes wrong, which is worth more that money can buy.

<Content>Excellent value Stayed for almost a week on a visit to NYC. Considering the ludicrous prices of Manhattan hotels, this is a real find .... on a quiet street (my room looked out onto the even quieter courtyard), smart, small, with good sized bathroom. Pleasant simple help-yourself breakfasts in the morning, free (one computer) internet in lobby, very easy to get everywhere - walking distance to theatres and restaurants, and close to 42nd and 50th street subway stops. A real haven to come back to at the end of the sight-seeing day. Discreet and helpful service. Only tiny fault was that the reading lights in the room were weak. But overall highly recommended.

<Content>A great little place in the Big Apple My wife and I stayed at the 414 Inn for a weekend in May 2005. We arrived a number of hours prior to check in and were told we could leave our luggage in the lobby while we explored the city for a few hours. Mike was a real pleasure to deal with at the front desk. He gave us maps of the area, explained the subway system, and told us of a number of great places to dine in the area. The location of the hotel is terrific. Plenty of restaurants and shops nearby and only a short walk to the center of Times Square and Broadway theaters. The rooms are nice sized for NYC. They are nothing very special, but they are clean, have comfortable beds, and are very quiet. One negative is the lack of an elevator. We were on the 3rd floor and it was a job to drag our luggage up and down the narrow stairway. The breakfast that is included in the price is a nice extra. Each morning there was a table set up near the lobby with croissants, mini bagels, muffins, cereal, juice, and coffee. For the location, price, and friendliness of the staff the 414 Inn is a great bargain. Don't expect anything luxurious though.

<Content>Hidden Gem in N.Y.C. Spent one night at the 414 during an overnight trip to N.Y.C. Room was immaculate -- spotless would not be an overstatement! Much more spacious than I expected. Lobby was being prepared for remodelling -- so it didn't offer a very good first impression, but I'm certain it will be better than adequate when remodelling is complete. Staff was friendly, accommodating and very patient with my multiple requests for directions. Excellent location! Only a couple-minute stroll to Times Square, Theater District and Restaurant Row. Fair priced for such a quality, mid-town hotel. Will definitely stay here again -- and would highly recommend it based on location (convenient!), price and cleanliness.

<Content>Great Place to Stay in NYC We stayed at this small hotel in December 2004 for 3 nights, and we loved it. The location is perfect, because it is in a quiet nieghborhood but also one or two blocks from all the excitement of the theatre district and Times Square. The staff was very pleasant, and the people at the front desk are very friendly and helpful. I plan to stay there everytime I visit New York City. Highly recommended.

<Content>What's not to love? I stayed here for one week in May 2005. There was nothing about the 414 that didn't please me. The location is great - close to theatres and Restaurant Row. (Walk to the Market Cafe near 9th  37th - had a TERRIFIC meal there! Although, many talk about surly waitstaff - we had no problems.) The room was clean and stylishly modern overlooking a garden courtyard - situated between two front and back buildings. My room was in the back building, was quiet and I had no trouble with noise at all - and I am a light sleeper! Each morning there was a very nice breakfast available - cereal, juice, fresh pastries - a great start to the day! The staff were really great and it felt like a home away from home. Mike is REALLY terrific! He was helpful in every respect and gave me some great restaurant recommendations! I have NEVER been happier with accomodations before - I'll certainly be back!

<Content>Great Hotel This was a very nice little hotel. My boyfriend and I satyed there from April 7 -12. We stayed room 301 facing a courtyard, so it's was really quiet. Our room was quite big and bathroom was really nice and spacious.Location is perfect - lots of restaurants nearby and everythings else is just walking distance. Such a great place so near to Times Square.Mike from the Reception was really helpful. I would not hesitate to stay there again!!!

<Content>Shhhh...keep it a secret!! Wow. Wow. Wow. This place is amazing!! For a boutique hotel in the theatre district--it is soooo affordable! The rooms are very clean and well kept. I really enjoyed the experience of living like a New Yorker...the block is fairly quite and the hotel is the only one on the block. There is a great pizza place and a sushi bar right next door. Even the continental breakfast was good and the staff was always ready and willing to help us out in any way. For example, Kabeem (sp?) became our hero while our stay in NYC...he got us into restaurants we requested and even wrote us a handwritten note after our stay, thanking us for our business. Customer service is definitely a HUGE priority here. Stay here--I promise you won't be disappointed!! Oh!..PS...Want to have a fabulous dinner in the neighbor?...go to 44th and X....food was delicious and has a romantic atmosphere (a little loud though)..it's on the corner of 10th Ave. and 44th street. Enjoy your trip!

<Content>Small Hotel, Big Impact My mom and I stayed here for a weekend - wasn't sure what to expect given the other reviews, but overall, we were very pleased. The room was bigger than other hotels we've stayed at, clean, nice bathroom, and the fireplace and breakfast in the morning were a definite plus. They allowed us to leave our bags prior to checking in and after checking out (prior to leaving the city) which is something most other hotels would not do for you. Mike at the front desk was incredibly helpful, offering the type of personal service one would definitely not obtain at bigger hotels. The hotel itself is located near many restaurants and is only a few blocks away from Times Square, but far enough to be away from the hustle and bustle of traffic and noise. Overall, we would definitely stay here again and were definitely pleased.

<Content>Midtown Inn at great price We stayed here in December for our annual New York trip. The hotel is on 46th street, one block west of Restaurant Row. The rooms were standard New York size with nice size bath. I found the breakfast/lobby area small and the food basic (carbs only--no fruit for breakfast). Tables were not cleaned or set between patrons. Upper floors are walk-up and there was no assistance with baggage. Our room had no hair-dryer but one was provided when asked. We would stay here again because the price was right, and the location was great for being in Midtown but now know what to expect.

<Content>Good Deal, Clean Room, Safe Area... I stayed at this hotel in Jan of 2005 for 3 nights. We stayed on the 3rd floor. The rooms were nice and clean. No elevators. Rooms decorated in art deco style. Decent sized room for NYC. Hotel located in a residential/resteraunt area. LOTS of great little resteraunts and bars in the area...lots of night life with nice friendly people, no obnoxious dance clubs. You must have your room key to get in the front door and there was always a friendly attendant at the front desk, which made us feel safe. Located within walking distance to times square and close to the theatre district, but I'd rather be a little closer to a subway station, but if it's nice weather then you don't mind walking a bit to save a few hundred bucks.Breakfast is included in your stay (rare for NYC) and they had a large assortment of fresh pastries, bagles, coffe, tea, juice and muffins.There were only 2 things we found to be negative about this hotel:Our room faced the street, which is VERY noisey 24 hrs a day and the walls are pretty thin too! we could hear the people in the next room talking! and people getting back to their room at 3am were always noisey in the halls. The second thing was the heat...no thermostat in your room, so you can't control your temp...our room was SO hot the first night...then we learned to leave the window open during the day and it was fine for the last 2 nights.All in all if you visting NYC to see the sites this is a great place for you to stay and save some cash! I would recommend.

<Content>Great Little Hotel!!!! We stayed at this hotel from 28/1 to 4/2 and this was my first trip to New York. I read the reviews here beforehand and was in two minds, but have to say that I was more than happy with this little place!The rooms were clean, stylish and well presented, with nice beds and a good shower. The hotel consists of two buidlings and we were in the rear, so had virtually no noise from traffic or activity in the streets. The hotel is excellent for getting to broadway, times square and getting around the city (fantastic for getting to intrepid if you are an anarac like me!). The breakfast was good each morning. The staff were all very friendly and helpful (yes even the one who appeared surly!!), Mike and Andrew were great, and I feel we had excellent customer service whilst there. I thoroughly recommed this hotel and would stay there again!

<Content>Good and bad We went to this hotel because we had read reviews on this site. The room was great, the bed comfortable and the room and bathroom clean and a good sizeAs for the staff, Mike was great, very friendly and helpful. However another (female) member of staff was on in the mornings and was downright surly and rude. This did kind of spoil it.The location is great and we walked to a lot of places and Mike was very helpful in suggesting restaurants.One last thing, we were on the top floor and had a fire escape to right in front of the windows. You cannot, however, lock the windows. Even with the locks shut tight it is possible to open the windows.The breakfast was great, as was the constant supply of tea and coffee. I would have given the hotel 4 stars were it not for the very unfriendly member of staff.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful This hotel was such a joy to find in the big city. The bed had a down comforter. The staff was extremely helpful. The hotel offered coffee  tea in the kitchen at all times and bountiful breakfast choices for free (bagels, muffins, juice, etc.). The hotel is located on Restaurant Row, with reasonably affordable restaurants with food from almost every country imaginable within a two-mile radius. The street was actually quiet for New York, especially considering that Times Square and many Broadway theaters were just a short walk away. My room overlooked a courtyard, not the street, which was a definite plus. Though it was too cold to sit out there (Thanksgiving), I imagine that it would be a charming place to rewind in warmer months. The room was not large, but it was bigger than several others I've stayed at in Manhattan. Overall, a great bargain. I'm looking forward to staying here again one day.

<Content>Great little hotel! Stayed here for 4 nights in early January. I like this hotel a lot. For the most part, it was clean. They have free breakfast, though I was never up early enough to try it. It was quiet. Great night's sleep! I liked the room's size, very comfortable bed, and large spacious bathroom.If you want to watch tv, only a few channels work, but that was fine by me.There is no elevator so be prepared to carry your own luggage upstairs.I got a great deal for this comfortable room.Great location! Very close to the Theatre District and Time Square.Have fun!

<Content>mixed feelings After reading the reviews on this site, I booked through hotels and stayed 4 nights from Dec 28-Jan 1. Was told if I had direct booked I would have had a shot at a better room facing courtyard with king size bed. Wasn't offered because of discount hotels booking.First of all, the pluses: Great central location within walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go. Very nice staff, wrote us a welcome note and gave us a bottle of wine upon arrival. They were available for questions, recommendations if needed. We felt comfortable coming and going. Room was clean and attractive in a low budget kind of way, and bed was not great but comfortable enough. The continental breakfast was a nice touch. The caring staff tried to solve problems as they arose. Checkout was at noon and we were able to store our suitcases in the lobby area after checkout but before we left town.Minuses: Room was small and not much storage area. Very narrow staircase offered great exercise but hard to maneuver with suitcases. We were on the fourth floor, and the first 2 nights we were there it was so hot in our room that we couldn't sleep. Radiator heat with no room controls; had to open windows just to make it bearable, which brought in the noise from the street. Don't stay here if you are a light sleeper who can't sleep through street noise! The room temp was better the second two nights but we still had to have windows wide open. One bedside lamp wasn't working and we couldn't find a control for it but when I felt down the cord there was a break in it where safety wrap had come off, a dangerous lamp but since it wasn't working anyway, there was no real threat. The bathroom fan had no on/off switch either, so we couldn't figure out how to get it on. It was needed as the bathroom gets quite steamy and humid. The hot water in the shower was more like lukewarm, not as hot as I like it. Breakfast coffee one morning was ice cold and undrinkable. Croissants were fresh and tasty; muffins seemed day old (stale). Overall, I had a decent experience because it's NY and the trip was great all together. I liked the location very much; had never stayed on the west side and it was so convenient for theater. Restaurant row is literally a block away. I can't say I'd stay there again though; especially on the fourth floor in the winter. If you try it, request a lower room facing courtyard for less noise (so I'm told).

<Content>Mixed Feelings About This One The concept of a BB in the City is an interesting one, however, the clientele during our stay wasn't up on the etiquette that should be extended in such a small setting. We felt like we were living in a college dorm with people slamming doors, laughing, stomping their feet going up and down the stairs, at all hours of the night. These people belong in large hotels. Perhaps quiet please signs in the halls would help.We were also concerned about being asked for our driver's licenses upon checking in, even though we prepaid and provided a credit card for incidentals. They were photocopied. With all the identity theft going on these days, this was a little disconcerting.We would probably pass on another stay.

<Content>414 Inn - not bad! We stayed here for six nights in December 2004. The clientele book mostly via the web, usually using hotels. There are a fair number of international visitors, as well as folks who would have been in youth hostels a few years ago. The location is great - just west of Ninth. The buffet breakfast is OK - but be warned, the eats go fast! The stairway is steep (OSHA compliant?) and there is no elevator - be warned again. The rooms are SMALL, but clean. Somehow, the same level of cleanliness does not apply to the stairway carpets or the lobby (I use the term loosely). The staff said they planned to renovate the lobby after Christmas (it needs it badly!). The radiator in the bedroom had no controls, so we had to open the window to cool things down (in December!). One bar of soap to schlep between the sink and the shower. Bottom line, a reasonable value (NYC hotel prices have gone through the roof lately). Would we stay there again? No, thanks.

<Content>Surprise, surprise! In the past I've stayed at the Skyline and Warwick hotels in NYC and had great experiences. I like to try something different every visit, and this time I was short on money but taking my sister, so I wanted her to have a good room. After reading all the great reviews of 414 on here I booked without hesitation, although I'm not crazy about the Hell's Kitchen area. They called to confirm the day before I left which has never happened at the other hotels. My hotels in the past have taken up quite a bit of space and been impossible to miss, so when I arrived at 414 and saw nothing more than a small door I knew I was in for something different. We had to buzz in to enter which I've never done before. I was horrified by the dark lobby which is really just a desk and a couple of chairs. They wouldn't let us check in early but said we could store our bags there while we go out. They didn't have an actual luggage storage area. Instead she told us to leave our bags by the door, and she gave us a colored sticker to stick on them. I don't know what the point of this was. When we finally did check in we just took the bags without being asked anything. The staircase up to the room was dark and narrow. I was scared of what I would when I finally entered the room but was really finding it all quite humorous that my sister was experiencing the sterotypical ghettoness of New York for her first trip. The hallway was so dim, only lit by a light bulb on each floor. However, when I entered the room I was so impressed. It was small but spacious enough for us. I searched around for bugs or mice or blood stains or some other disgusting thing but found nothing. The bed was extremely comfortable. The staff was all very friendly. Most of the things they advertise that come in the rooms aren't actually in there. You have to call down to the lobby and they will bring them to you. We were always greeted with a smile and offered friendly conversation by the front desk, and even the maids. Although I loved the buidlings in the area, I felt a little scared walking alone with my sister at night. After dark there were a lot of restaurants on the street, each one with one person just hanging out in front. However, this is just a fear I have in any American city, including my own (but I don't walk here, so it's not a problem). My impressions of the hotel went from disappointed to disgusted to being excited to return. It's not a high-class, upscale hotel, but it was by far my favorite room and the best service I have encountered at any New York hotel.

<Content>Great Little Spot Stayed at the 414 Inn,Nov 10,11,12,13. I Have used tripadvisor many times to choose my hotels, and once again was pleased with my choice. The reviews were right on.This is a quiet, small hotel with great staff,and the location could not be better, so central.We were on the forth floor and as mentioned before there is no elevator,it didn't bother us but some people wouldn't like it. The rooms were large and very clean. We used the fireplace sitting/lobby area alot to have a drink together at the end of the day. Breakfast was great. My only complaint was the smell of cigarette smoke that sometimes came out of the vent in the bathroom? I just closed the bathroom door before we went to bed and the room was fine, and it certainly would not keep me from staying here again. I couldn't believe how friendly the people of NY are, and very helpful, especially in the subway, for train info. The subway is the best way to get around and it doesn't take long to figure it out. Go see the city and have a great time, we did! and we can't wait to go back.

<Content>The Good and The Bad Here's the low-down:The Good: Located in the former 'Hell's Kitchen', now trendy restaurants row and theatre district. Friendly Staff. Nice Sized Rooms for NYC. Complimentary breakfast with cereal, croisants, juice and coffee.The Bad: Street Noise at night from garbage trucks and restaurant deliveries. No Elevator. Bad TV reception. No Luggage storage room. King Size bed is really two twins with ridge down the middle.In Summary: For the money, you can't really complain because of the location near Times Square and the included breakfast and overall service. Just don't be expecting more than the three star hotel rating allows.

<Content>Really great boutique hotel We stayed here for four nights in October and had a great time. The location is excellent -- perfectly situated for Theatre and dining. And if you're into walking (as we are), well, it's in the middle of the city.The staff is very nice and the rooms are relatively roomy and very clean (just make sure you get up before 1pm -- the cleaning staff is not onsite 24 hours). What more can you ask for? Great value with respect to the area. Highly recommended!

<Content>Great Hotel The 414 Inn was a great find, and the positive reviews already detailed are an accurate reflection of this hotel. It is ideally situated being a 5-10 min walk from Times Square, and is in the heart of Restaurant Row, giving you the best of both worlds. The rooms are well proportioned, and the standard was well above average. The fresh croissants and bagels in the morning were also a very nice touch.The only reason i didn't rate this hotel as excellent was due to the telephone system. For some reason calls could not be put through to my room, but apart from that i would definately stay at the 414 Inn again. Book early as it is a popular place.

<Content>A Gem in NYC August 2004 - We just got back from our 4 night stay at 414 Inn, a lovely small hotel in the theatre district. We arrived in the city at 2 am and walked up 8th av thinking twice about the location. Then we turned right on 46th and landed in a charming neighborhood. A couple of blocks along restaurant row and we were there. Our room was clean and quiet, decorated in a pleasant modern style with crisp white linens and down comforter. Bathrooms are spacious. A nice continental breakfast is served in the lobby each morning (you can take breakfast out to the courtyard in the back to eat alfresco).The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.All this for a reasonable price. My husband and I highly recommend this gem of a hotel.
