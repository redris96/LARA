<Content>IT was OK My friend and I spent 2 nights at this hotel. It is a nice location and the hotel looks nice too. The room was a great size, clean and with a very comfortable bed. They have a free internet, nice size pool and the breakfast was all right also. However, the staff was a disappoinment. I work at a hotel myself and know that the front desk clerk is the main key. I believe they should have a nicer and brighter personality and greet their guests with a smile. Too bad that in two days, they did not even say hi to me when i came back to the hotel.

<Content>We Were Very Pleased We stayed here the night before a cruise. It was ideal for us. There would have been a free shuttle from the airport but our plane was 4 1/2 hours delayed and the shuttle stopped running at 11 PM. However, we were very pleased with the shuttle that took us to the cruise port the next day - easily arranged and inexpensive (can't remember how much now).We didn't get to sample much of the hotel's offerings because we got in so late and had to leave in the morning, but the room was lovely and comfortable. It had a full kitchen. And the breakfast was really good - it was way more than a continental breakfast.

<Content>Front desk staff needs training Hotel itself is a typical SpringHill, but front desk staff needs work,slow check-in, got to room opened door and some guys inside starts yelling, they had already rented room. Have not had this happen since the 80's at a Howard Johnson. Front desk didn't seem to fazed by it though, wonder how much it happens there.

<Content>don't make the same mistake i did While trying to decide where to stay, I read all the reviews and decided to give Springhill suites benefit of the doubt based on the positive reviews. If you are considering booking here in spite of the negative reviews, don't. The shuttle service is poorly managed - driver was also not particularly helpful or sympathetic even if you are travelling with an infant. The person at hotel gave us poor directions on where to wait for him so we ended walking back and forth with luggage/elderly/infant in tow. Then ended up waiting at airport 45mins before driver came back for us even though they do have 2 shuttles but only running 1. Front desk is not very friendly or understanding or helpful in any way... definitely not the listening type. Our other guests were not helped since they did not know our full last name which is hyphenated, i didn't think that was all too uncommon but at least i'd hoped they at least call up to see if we were waiting for the people. Room is superficially clean - wear slippers otherwise your white socks will not be white for much longer. The 24 hour coffee available area is also messy and dirty. I'm hoping breakfast is edible and clean but not too hopeful.... manage your expectations if you still plan on booking here. Me and my family will be trying the Hilton on our return trip... similar level to this one... we shall see if this review is just consistent for miami or just marriot's springhill suite here....

<Content>Not too nice at all After reading the reviews here, we decided to book a night here. Why? Well, we would arrive late from a long flight and had to drive the next day away from Miami. We wanted to go for a Marriott hotel (which SpringHills is) since we have always been happy with their quality. Not this time...We booked because we wanted an airport hotel with free shuttle so we would be quickly from the airport to our bed. Wrong... This has been the longest wait ever for an airport shuttle. We called first from the airport and were told it would be there in 20 minutes. So we waited. After 45 minutes we called again. They said it was on their way. 20 minutes later we called again, they said we already called and should not bother, I complained that we have called already over an hour before: they claimed I was not right... so basically telling me I was a liar. I didn't feel right because of that comment. We waited another 20 minutes more and it arrived. All the other hotelshuttles we must have seen past 10 times already... We could have already been in bed. One might think: why not skip the hotel and take another one? Well, we had prepaid it.In the hotel I got into an argument with the lady that made me feel like a liar on the phone. Se kept with her story, but the guy next to her obviously had the phone the first time and pretended then a shuttle would come. Nice that she protects her colleague, but I would have felt better not to feel a liar...The first room we got smelled badly (bad airco I guess)... So I had to go down again and complain (again... and that after being awake for over 24 hours...). So we got another room and went to bed immediately. While we were sleeping the door got knocked on to give us some chips anc candy for the late shuttle. Well, and then we could finally get some sleeping, like 2,5 hrs later then we had hoped for...Because of that bad experience I do not like the hotel. The room itself was spacious, it was clean. The bathroom was small. The breakfast was simple and not too tasty. The hotel gets booked by a lot of Hispanic people I had the feeling (or is that because it is Miami?). Next day the same with the shuttle back to the airport (to get our rental car): it just doesn't have any schedule. In all Marriott hotels I found an enveloppe to review the hotel, not in this one. Strange huh?Next time we have to have a room near Miami Airport we will not stay here...

<Content>Nothing beats the SpringHill Suites A quick cab ride from Miami airport, this hotel was excellent. The room was clean and the staff were friendly. I suggest renting a car as the hotel as it is about a 20-30min walk to get something to eat. But they have a shuttle that takes you anywhere you want. I used it to take me directly to McDonalds. There's plenty of movies to choose from in your room and they have a nice little breakfast in the mornings.This is the perfect hotel for a Miami-shopping visit as it's central to the major shopping centres. But if you're looking for the nightlife at Miami Beach then you're about a 30min drive away.I was in Miami since this visit and tried to book here again but they were fully booked. It must be a popular hotel!

<Content>Great stay Stayed here in the suite with 1 king bed on the 2nd floor. Was in town to attend a wedding. Location is good - close to the Dolphin Mall, Miami Int'l Airport, Mall of Americas,  a number of restaurants. Not very close to the beaches (about a 45min+ drive). Hotel is located in the middle of 7th street with a lake behind it. Hotel interior is nice. Room was spacious and very clean. Included a microwave, fridge, and counter space. Bathroom was clean and fixtures were like new. Had a view of the lake in the back of the hotel, room was very comfortable. A wall separated the bed from the living area (sofabed  chair). Free breakfast was EXCELLENT with a number of items available (make it yourself waffles, milk cartons (2%  whole), oj  cranberry juice, pastries, bagels, egg patties - very good, sausage patties, boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal, toast, english muffins, muffins, etc). I made a breakfast bagel w/an egg pattie, sausage pattie, and shredded cheese. Breakfast area was clean with tables  chairs and utensils were always stocked. Hotel staff  front desk were very courteous and helpful upon arrival  departure. A shuttle was available but we did not use it. Price is slightly a little higher than budget ($100+/night). I enjoyed my stay  would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for lodging by the airport.

<Content>Great for our one night stay We stayed at this hotel after seeing the mixed reviews here due to the proximity to the airport and the good rate. The hotel worked out very well for what we needed. We just needed a place near the airport since we had a morning flight and didn't want to deal with traffic. The room and hotel were clean. There was a kitchen and fridge but we didn't need to use it. The bed was extremely comfortable. I slept better than anywhere else on our vacation. The bathroom was small and the fan in there sounded like it was broken but it was modern and had a large vanity outside. We had a car so we could get to Coconut Grove in 20 minutes or so although the directions we were given went through a not so great part of the city. The pool looked decent. The free breakfast had a lot of options including waffles and hard-boiled eggs. Front desk staff was helpful and friendly. And free parking. There was also free computer/internet with printer in the lobby. So if you want to go see the sights, this is probably not the easiest hotel to be at but for one night near the airport I would recommend.

<Content>Stay Away This hotel is located in a strange location. It鈥檚 not close to anything. The hotel does provide a shuttle for a few local restaurants. The front desk was completely unhelpful and needs training. The hotel was full and the staff acted like they where out of control. The air-conditioning in our room did not work. We asked for a new room and they said sorry we are full. Only after I told them that I was checking out did they find another room in the sold-out hotel. The beds are old and very uncomfortable. The breakfast area is not large enough when the hotel is full 鈥?no place to sit. Plus by 9am they where out of almost everything! We won鈥檛 stay at this hotel again!

<Content>An Okay Stay Hi...During high season, this hotel went for $199 a night. We booked it for $89 a night on Priceline for a three night stay.The hotel provides a breakfast from 7am to 9am every day; buffet style. Cranberry juice, orange juice, coffee, tea, eggs, sausage, muffins, danish, toast, bagels, waffles, yogurt, milk, etc. Since it is mainly a business hotel, I imagine that is why breakfast ends at 9am. I found that to be annoying though, since you can't sleep in and go to breakfast a little later. The room was spacious with two double beds and a sleeper sofa, microwave, fridge, sink and table with two chairs. The bathroom was a bit small, but the sink and mirror thankfully were outside the cramped bathroom. Our room overlooked the Blue Lagoon. The hotel is in a business park near 836, but in a not-so-nice area of town. I much preferred Doral on NW87th St to this area, but hey...at least this is close to the airport. Housekeeping could have been a bit more thorough. I observed hair in the bathroom corner that sat there for our whole three day stay, and it wasn't our hair because none of us have black hair. Also, the front desk was a bit confused. Our second morning began with a bang from housekeeping asking us why we were still there; their records indicate that we should have checked out. I had to explain that I had confirmation number/reservations for a THREE night stay. The woman said she would look into it and let us know. Then, the front desk calls us and states that we were paid for one night. Impossible. Priceline makes you pay at the time of your reservation, so I had to march down there and show her my printed out confirmation and VISA payment. Good thing I always keep records!!!!!!!!!!!For things to do, we took a day trip ( out to 41 west aka Tamiami Trail) to the Everglades National Park. Did their two hour tram tour to Shark Valley Visitor Center @ $14.50 per adult. Very cool. Then we went to Everglades Swamp Safari Park and did an airboat ride $17 pp w/discount. This includes your airboat ride, wildlife show, self guided walking tour, and you can hold Snappy their 3 yr old alligator for a picture too. Another thing to do is to go to Parrot Jungle Island ( 836 East to 395 follow signs for Miami Beach and Parrot Jungle Trail)....Had a blast there too ....It's about 25 minutes from the hotel and you could spend all day there too. The hotel has shuttle to Miami Intl Airport, but we rented a car. All in all...an okay stay.

<Content>We will not stay again We stayed 4 night from December 27 to 30, 2006. We checked in a room on 2nd floor. The location is not easy found but it is quiet and the room is adequate. We saw some tiny little ants in the kitchen area. I cleaned up and wished they will not return. I also noticed some holes in the blanket caused by clothes moth.The 2nd day the ants again were in the kitchen when we return to the hotel in the evening. We noticed that the ants were not only the kitchen, but some also in the ceilings of living room and bathroom sink area (the area just outside bathroom). I called front desk and reported the situation. I was told that at this time of the year, ants are everywhere in Florida. We do not live here therefore we do not know if this is true. I was promised to get it cleaned by maintenance people or we will move to another room.The 3rd day when we got back to the room, the kitchen was not cleaned and ants were everywhere. The shower head in bathroom had problem too. Only half of water came out the shower head the other half came out the bathtub tap (the lower tap). It was fine the first 2 nights. I called the front desk and was given a room on 3rd floor. We moved to 3rd floor. In the elevator, we heard and saw some other guests moving up too. We realized that we were not the only room had ants problem.The exhaust fan in the bathroom in our 3rd floor room was not working. I reported to the front desk the next day morning. The female staff said:鈥?I will get maintenance people to fix it today. But do you NEED the exhaust fan?鈥?I replied 鈥漮f cause we need it. Otherwise may smells鈥?She asked鈥漌hat may smell?鈥?I was speechless.We will not stay in this hotel again.

<Content>NIce hotel After searching extensively for a place to stay near Miami Airport, I chose Springhill Suites by Marriott. This was with the help of the reviews on this site. When I made my reservation I explained that I would be arriving around 10 a.m. as I was getting off a cruise ship and requested early check in. When we arrived we were promptly looked after and the clerk told us about the shuttle to the Dolphin Mall, which was leaving about 25 minutes after our arrival and left the hotel again in 2 hours. The room was clean, fresh and quiet even though we over looked the parking lot. Since we did not have a rental car we took the shuttle to the Mall, actually, the hotel shuttle takes you to a nearby hotel (Sheraton I think) and the Dolphin Mall shuttle picks up there. Cost about $2. The Mall does not open until noon on Sunday so we took the later shuttle and had a late lunch at the Mall. Just before returning to the hotel we bought a take out pizza and heated that up in the microwave in our room for dinner. The beds were a little hard, but for a night it was fine. In the morning we had a nice buffet breakfast provided by the hotel. I was impressed that they even had make your own waffles with blueberry preserve! I liked our stay at Spinghill Suites so much that I am staying there pre-cruise in January 2007.

<Content>Great stay during Hurricane Wilma Hi! We where stuck in Miami during Hurricane Wilma (Oct. 2005), so we looked for a hotel to stay in during the hurricane. It had to be close to the airport, because we were scheduled to leave the tuesday after the hurricane, and nobody knew what would happen (or not). In any case, this hotel was a great find! Very friendly staff, great room (for 107 USD/night, though -- for twice that money you get better rooms elsewhere, I believe). Breakfast was good (but early, ending at 9). Nice pool. In any case: We stayed in the room for the hurricane-day, with our two little children, and it was big enough to do that without completely going nuts. Good. Also: Windows cannot be opened, which in this case was good, because there's no slits for rain to come in through. We were on the lake side, and you could see the wind coming, but the windowpanes only wibrated lightly. And: One of the only hotels with perfect electric, phone, water and even TV during and after the storm. Everybody stayed calm and was prepared, they offered us flashlights at the front desk, personell stayed in the hotel during storm (which I liked much better than seeing them flee the place). So: Would stay there again in a heartbeat, even without a storm!

<Content>Good Value; Great Service My mother and I stayed at this hotel for one night prior to a cruise. The shuttle picked us up from the airport and the driver gave us some good options for dinner. After we unpacked, he took us to an excellent fish restaurant, which was reasonably priced and not too far from the hotel. When we were ready to return to the hotel, he picked us up as promised. Both the shuttle driver and the front desk personnel were friendly and helpful.The room was basic suite design -- nothing fancy, but fancy wasn't what we booked. The room got my mother's seal of approval for cleanliness and design, and that's all I needed. We had a view of the lagoon, which isn't beautiful, but nicer to look at than the parking lot. We didn't book the room to look out the window, anyway.The breakfast provided lots of variety. Because we were there on a holiday weekend, the breakfast room was fairly crowded, but the staff did their best to keep up. The only problem we had was with the shuttle service to the cruise port. This was not the hotel shuttle -- it was a contractor with major problems. We got a very late start, and I'll save the story of how inept the driver and his boss in the other van were. Suffice it to say, take a cab to the cruise port!

<Content>Good for one night pre-cruise stay We stayed at this hotel, which is now a Marriott, Feb 10 and 11 this year. Room was fine, not as large as I thought it would be, but adequate and clean. The free breakfast was quite good, make your own waffles, cereal,yogurt, fruit, hard boiled eggs, sausage, danish, coffee and juice. The pool is small and quite cold. However,the hotel is away from everything. You need a car or taxi to get to any sights or restaurants. They do have a shuttle service to restaurants but you do have to wait since they have a free airport shuttle and that ties them up. We paid a very resonable $64 Entertainment Card rate which can't be beat, but I don't know what the new policy will be now that Marriott owns it. For a 1 night stay pre-cruise it's great since they also have a $9 pp shuttle to the port which was quick and convenient. We'd stay again for that rate if it was only for one night.

<Content>A good value. I stayed there with my husband and adult daughter for two nights in February and found it quite acceptable. We were on the back side facing the Lagoon and the room was very quiet, and had a nice view. The room and bathroom were large enough and were clean. It would have been better if the sitting area were fully (rather than just prtially) separated from the sleeping area, but the layout worked well enough for three people. The breakfast was much better than average, and the grounds were attractively landscaped. It is true that there is nothing in the immediate vicintiy of the hotel (although there is a large Radisson Hotel, which I assume has a restaurant, within walking distance). On the other hand, if you have a car, the location is very close to the airport (a plus since I had to pick up my daughter at 6:00 a.m.), and convenient to most anything in Miami (including Coral Gables and Coconut Grove). There is a shopping center with various stores and eating places about 5 minutes away by car. If you just need a place to sleep at a reasonable price, as opposed to a place to hang out all day, I would recommend this hotel without reservation. Note: the hotel is about to undergo a change in management, and will become a Summerfield Suites by Marriot.

<Content>Pleasant Stay We stayed here for one night prior to our departure out of Miami.We arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in time and there was no problem to have our room early, which was very much appreciated.We enjoyed the location and found it relaxing being by the lagoon. They recommended some restaurants near by and we decided on Catch of the Day, which was a funky Cuban restaurant with friendly staff and excellent food.The room itself was average, two double beds and a pull out couch with a mini kitchen. After two hectic weeks in Florida we found this Hotel quiet and relaxing.Later in the evening after my husband had already returned our vehicle to the airport, he realized that he forgot his credit card at the restaurant. When he went downstairs, they offered a ride back to the restaurant with their shuttle bus. We thought the breakfast offered was more than adequate and we liked that they offered coffee and tea with flavored creams through out the day, -nice touch. The driver we had in the morning to catch our flight was also very friendly and helpful.Our overall experience was very good. I would stay here again.

<Content>Bad place Stayed at this hotel 29-31 January and was extremely disgusted with the hotel in general. As another reviewer already mentioned, a woman's purse was robbed during breakfast. We were at the table next to her and did not see anybody near her table except for numerous cleaning staff walking by who I believed may have taken the purse that according to the woman contained over 2,000 USD. The hotel had closed circuit security video shown at the front desk however the one camera that was not functioning that day was the one that displayed the breakfast area. The other eight cameras were working fine. I believe this robbery was clearly an inside job. That staff was very unhelpful to the woman and her husband appeared to nearly have a heart attack but check-in staff did not show any concern. Onto other problems, upon early check-in, the hotel staff told me that the room check was secure and that my laptop could be placed in the closet. Later when our room was ready, we retrieved our bags and I was literally yelled at because I left a laptop there and that they would not be responsible if it was broken. The woman literally made fun of me when her coworker was the one that told me to put it inside the closet in the first place. I must add that the beds in our room had gross stains over all the bed linens, hair in the kitchen sink, sofa torn and bathroom sink did not function. Hardly any of the staff speak English so good luck on trying to communicate to anyone! There is no restaurant for dinner inside the hotel, they do offer a shuttle to numerous places. When I placed an order at the Roadhouse Grill (one of the published restaurants serviced by the courtesy bus) and asked to be taken to pick it up (with plenty of notice and not in any rush) I was given a very rude look by the driver of the courtesy van and he did not want to take me but with some explaining and saying please in Spanish, he obliged. This hotel seriously is terrible. I would never stay here again nor suggest anybody else does. Stay at the Radisson down the street or sleep outside the hotel, it would be safer in my opinion. I have had much better hotel stays while on trips to India and remote areas of China. Best of luck with this hotel if you choose to stay here. Dont take any valuables with you, they will be swiped by the staff!

<Content>Very Nice hotel- great view of the Lagoon We stayed there the night before our cruise and for 3 days after the cruise when our flight was cancelled due to the January blizzard. The room had a kitchenette with a sink and fridge. The room was clean and well arranged. They have full complimentary breakfast buffet and a shuttle to transport you to and from the airport and local area. WE had a view of the lagoon, which was quite picturesque. The only drawback was that it is in walking distance of nothing. It was a nice place to stay and I don't think you can go wrong if you need a room for a night or so. I would stay there again, and I didn't hesitate to when I was unable to fly home after the blizzard.

<Content>Beware My husband and I booked a stay at the Amerisuites on Saturday, January 29. The was a wait to get checked in and only one person at the desk. The hotel was completely booked they said and they had run out of a lot of things for breakfast . Also, during breakfast, in plain view a woman's purse was robbed and the person at the desk would not do anything about it until we all insisted that she call the police. I think the hotel handled this poor woman's situation very poorly stating that they could not control who came in the hotel. It really ruined our stay they and we certainly did not feel safe there after that.

<Content>Not Bad for the Price Stayed three nights at Amerisuites Miami Blue Lagoon, stating on 26 December 2004. I selected this hotel after noting that it rated no 3 in Miami on this website.From my experience, the room I was given was large by most standards for a hotel in this price range. It was located on the fifth floor facing the airport and it included a king size bed, sofa, desk and a small kitchenette with a microwave oven. The room was clean but showed signs of wear and tear. The bathroom was small and the bathroom exhaust fan was very loud. Some aircraft noise could be heard late at night but this was hardly intrusive. Although breakfast was included in the room rate, I did not try this as it finishes quite early.At US$70/night (+taxes), I believe the hotel respresents good value for money provided you accept its one big limitation, which is its location. The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere useful for tourists. The hotel offers free car parking which handy as you are going to need a hire car if you are going to get around Miami effectively.The shuttle to/from the airport leaves only once an hour and from my experience is unreliable.A quick tip is not to get a room numbered between X13 and X16 (where X is the floor number, for example - 513). These are the rooms located near the elevators. The floors have been tiled in front of the elevators and the housekeeping trolleys and other wheeled items make a large amount of noise as they roll over the gaps between the tiles early in the morning as you are trying to sleep.

<Content>Not Bad For What You Pay I booked two connecting rooms for 4 people at the Amerisuites Miami Blue Lagoon for a post cruise weekend stay in January 2005, based entirely on the information I read on this web site. We got off the cruise ship early and were able to get into our rooms before 10 AM Saturday morning which was definetly appreciated as it let us unpack, rest and cleanup and get an earlier start on our day. The rooms were large, modern and clean and everything worked. We paid $100/night (pus tax) for each room. Front desk was friendly and helpful. The said the outside (small) pool was open 24 hours. They have a security guard in the parking lot in front of the hotel 24 hrs a day even though the hotel is located in a quiet, nice area of condos next to the airport. I saw several people jogging on the sidewalk along the road to the hotel that morning - the road isn't that busy and the properties it passes are mostly nicely landscapped so if you are a runner its nice. The fitness room is your standard small room with a treadmill, exercise bike and and another peice of equipment plus a TV. The morning continental breakfast chioces are substantial with fresh fruit (apples, bananas), toast, bagels, english muffins, make-your-own waffles, scrambled eggs, pastries, muffins, cereals, and coffee/tea and fruit juices. The seating area is good sized. Free coffee is available in the lobby all day (though it isn't kept up very well later on). The only complaint about breakfast is that the prson responsible for keeping the area clean and stocked seems to disappear once things are laid out so that eventually you're out of silveware or something else and all the tables have garbage on them. At the scheduled end of breakfast things are cleared away pretty quickly. You definetly need a car for this hotel. Nothing within walking distance but restaurants, Cuban, chain and otherwise, are not to far away. The front desk has a map. I didn't use the hotel airport shuttle (leaves afor the airport at 5AM and every hour after that) as I had a rental car to return but you can drive to the terminal in about 20 minutes on a weekday and rental car return is only about 5 minutes away from there. I would stay at this hotel again, especially if I needed to catch an early flight out of town. I found that $100/night seemed to be a reasonable price for a half way decent hotel on a weekend in Miami in January - though I have paid as low as $70/night for comparable places (not near the airport) in other east coast cities.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay Excellent location if you visit Miami on Business. It is located in a quiet and clean area near the International Airport, which is convienient if you have to get to the airport early. Service is good and friendly and the breakfast is close to fantastic; too much for those, who stick to low calorie diet. The hotel should have direct ADSL connection in the bedrooms without having to go through a privider. The breakfast area which close to the front desk is somewhat small.

<Content>Not the greatest There were long line ups when we arrived-not enough staff. The room was basic but fairly clean. The AC was extremely loud and so was the bathroom fan. You could also here the planes landing. These noises made if difficult to sleep (especially the AC). I've never slept in a more uncomfortable bed. You could hear the springs popping and the sheets did not stay on. There is absolutely NOTHING around, not even a restaurant. There is no restaurant in the hotel either which made meals troublesome. Pool was freezing so the kids could not swim. The shuttle to the hotel was 45mins late due to lack of staff.If you're only staying one night, then this hotel is okay, but I would not recommend staying here for anything longer that that.

<Content>only okay Some of the previous reviewers must have awfully low standards was all I kept thinking while at this Amerisuites for a long weekend. The rooms were not horrendous, but not terribly clean either...typical high-use wear and tear. After staying at Country Inns and Suites a number of times, this room felt tiny, and the shared TV between sleeping areas was clever but not so great for my family's viewing needs. We had a car and used the hotel as a place to just sleep between visits with friends. I would never suggest using this location as a base of operations for a vacation. We will not stay there again.

<Content>Adequate but nothing special Totally agree with the review posted on Dec29. The rating of this hotel went straight down hill after I booked it based on reviews several months ago. The TCB suite is good sized, with a sleeper sofa, dinning table with four chairs and a large L-shaped computer desk. It is quite clean. The standard room appears to be much smaller, based on other reviews. The kids got excited when the hotel staff told us the pool is heated and INDOOR. After they changed into swimming suit, they discovered that it is outdoor and freezing, and is no way heated. They were so disappointed. We also liked the Cuban restaurant the shuttle driver sent us very much. Great food, very reasonable. Breakfast is adequate but nothing special. Overall, the hotel is just average, and the location is rather inconvenient if you don't have a car. The shuttle will eventually take you to where you want to go, but not on your schedule. I'd stay here again for a good price but not for the hotel's regular price of over $100.

<Content>Pre Cruise Stay - Great Price Saturday 11-27-2004. My husband and I stayed at The Amerisuites Miami Blue Lagoon for one night as a pre-cruise stay. We always fly in a day early before a cruise to avoid missing our ship (due to possible weather issues and delays in Chicago) Upon arrival at the Miami Airport, we utilized the free courtesy phone that was available for the hotel. Approximately 25 minutes later, the hotel shuttle picked us up.Our room was $ 72.00 per night, including taxes. We had a nice room (2 Queen beds, bath, dressing area, small living room  kitchen) A few weeks prior to our arrival, I had called the hotel and requested a room on the lagoon side - Unfortunately, our room faced the parking lot, not the lagoon - oh well, not a major issue with us, as the room itself was spacious and clean. The breakfast buffet was good (except the eggs) and seeing as it is included with the cost of the room, it can't be beaten for the price. At the back of the property, there are a few patio tables and chairs that overlook the lagoon. My husband and I ate our breakfast outside, enjoying the warm Florida sun. It was very quiet and was exactly what we were looking for, a little R  R. The front desk staff (very pleasant and helpful) advised that there was a shuttle they could call ($ 9.00 per person) that would take us to the Miami Cruise pier the next day. Great deal. The only problem was that the next day (Sunday) we were taken for a ride by a taxi driver who pulled up and said that he was there to pick up 2 Adults and was going to the Miami Pier. Since there was no one else around, it appeared that the shuttle that we were expecting was actually a taxi. Before getting in, I asked the driver what the fare was......we were advised about $ 9.00 per person, so we loaded our luggage and hopped in. BIG MISTAKE. When we arrived at the pier, the total take ended up being $ 30.00 !! All in all, the hotel stay was very pleasant and we would stay again as a pre cruise option. Generally, we do not party the night before a cruise, so it was not a negative for us that the Hotel was away from all the action of South Beach. One thing we definately won't do again is hop into a cab if we have been told a shuttle has been requested.

<Content>Amerisuites; NOT the #3 best hotel in Miami We arrived at 7:30 p.m., and there were not any rooms on the lagoon side available, as the entire seventh floor is SMOKING. They gave us asixth floor room, that was SMOKED in as well. Lots of rooms,but few TCB suites available. This was December 17, 2004.The hotel staff was helpful, as I looked at 5 different rooms to tryto select the best. Turned out the best was an airport view, two doubles and a sofa, which turned into a bed.The breakfast was packed with people. Shuttle service took us to a good cuban restaurant and picked us up when we called that evening.I would say that Embassy Suites breakfasts are way better, and thatthe cast of characters that could be seen at a breakfast was likeMotel 6 people... on steriods, dashing to get waffles and rubbery eggs.Some even came literally in their pajamas, hair messy, etc. Uh, excuse me I really didn't come all the way to miami to see you like that.The pool: I'm sorry but there is NO WAY that it is heated. Staff,front desk staff, stop telling people it it heated. It was cold. I wentright out and felt it, cold. Hotel was clean, and felt safe but is located somewhat far away from everything.Did not meet expectations, and I was disappointed. This is definitely NOT the third best hotel in Miami. Don't be fooled, stay somewhere slightly more expensive and you will be happier.

<Content>Definitely Average.... This hotel was clean and they did have a cold/hot breakfast, however; the 1st time we went to breakfast they were out of coffee  eggs  sausage. Hotel is in the middle of no where so you need to take a taxi/shuttle everywhere or rent a car. Closest store is approx. 2 miles away. The rooms are average - suite was smaller than expected. King bed, easy chair (not a sofa only room for 1 person to sit not 2) and a small table with 2 chairs. Coffee maker worked, hair dryer pooped out after approx 30 seconds. Small bathroom. All  all great for the $$ but don't expect any luxuries here - definitely unimpressive  average.

<Content>Serviceable but not great We stayed at Ameriasuites Blue Lagoon in early December of this year.The hotel is somewhat like a Residence Inn in that they have the same type of room layout (bedroom, sitting area, kitchen, bath) and same type of food for breakfast. The price is a bit cheaper than Residence Inn.Just be forwarn that this hotel is in the middle of nowhere, although it's close to the airport. I don't even see any restaurants or fast food close by.The room is small for a suite. I would say it's more like a studio. It's hard to move around after we set up the sofabed for our son. The breakfast is the usual starchy breakfast food with some awful scrambled eggs. Even the make-your-own waffle wasn't very good.The Blue Lagoon appears to be a rectangular pond at the side of the hotel. I wouldn't exactly call that scenic.Overall I think I would rather spend the $20-30 more and stay at a Residence Inn or a Embassy Suites in a more convenient location.

<Content>Keep an open ear... Our fourth floor room was great with a lagoon view. The room was very clean. The breakfast is typical Amerisuites, large variety with nasty eggs. Waffles are good. There were of couse a few problems. One was the fitness center, it was stinky. A terrible mildew smell, so we couldn't work out.The location sucks! There is not reallly anything around. You can walk a mile or so to CVS or Walgreens, but that's not what I came to Miami to see. You have to depend on the shuttle if you don't rent a car, and the shuttle service is terrible. They only come to the airport on the hour, so even though we called for pickup we had to wait nearly 45 minutes for a van. Airport security told us to have a seat because he know our shuttle would be awhile.We also used the shuttle for the free trip to Dolphin Mall. They dropped us off at a pickup in front of Homestead Suites and left. Unfortunately, we were late, the Dolphin Shuttle had already come. We called the hotel to come and get us and of course we had to wait for their next pick up an hour later.Another time we rode the train into downtown Miami and returned to the airport to catch the shuttle. After waiting 30 minutes the shuttle drove by at about 40 mph. We ran after it but couldn't catch it. We called the hotel and she told us we were lying. That her shuttle did not reach the airport yet. A few minutes later the same driver came back and apologized, he said he just couldn't see people waiting. No wonder with his speed.I don't think I will stay here again.

<Content>No sleep till after 2.30 am Hotel was ok clean and pleasant staff very friendly.breakfast enjoyable and quite a few choices help yourself. We had a room on the 5th floor nothing wrong with room very large and airy and smelt nice. The problem was with other guests, one of the guests spent about an hour banging his hotel door taking packages in and out at 1am. We and other guests on our floor called front desk and they sent someone up to advise him to stop banging the door. this stopped. Then 10 minutes later a group of men and women came in and started to run up and down the corridor shouting. Then started having a party we called front desk again security came and advised them to be quiet they did calm down a bit but it was 2 .30 before we got any sleep. The hotel did act very quickly to our complaint but ut spoiled our stay.

<Content>A Great Stay! We stayed for 2 nights (Nov 7th  8th) and for $69/night, I was pleasantly surprised. We had a very spacious room with a king bed, kitchenette and fold-out sofa (perfect for parents travelling with a 3yr old) overlooking the lake/lagoon behind the hotel. The breakfast was hand's-down the best included hotel breakfast yet -- cook your own belgian waffles (with a cool automatic time to tell you when it's done), eggs, sausage, fresh fruit salad, and of course all the other breakfast fare, but a little better -- full-size muffins instead of those ubiquitous mini-muffins you find in many free continental breakfasts. The folks at the front desk were incredibly nice -- often a couple of them instead of just one clerk. Even the classical music piped out into the drive-up area outside the lobby was a nice touch. There appeared to be 24-hour security roaming the inside and outside of the hotel throughout our whole stay (even though this was in a nice office park area). The hotel is conveniently located near the airport (5 min away, the 826  836, as well as a Publix and Walgreens just 2 minutes away down NW 7th). The only slight negative was that the pool appeared to be unheated, a disappointment for my son. The breakfast alone would likely draw me back to the hotel -- and one other nicety that many other Miami (mostly downtown and in Miami Beach) don't offer - free parking and no resort fees.

<Content>AmeriSuites Blue Lagoon Hats off to Tripadvisor and the AmeriSuites Blue Lagoon Hotel! They exceeded every possible expectation I had for a hotel and then some. I was traveling alone to a hip hop dance convention. I used this site to research the best hotel I could get. I managed to not only get the best hotel room I could get for $67.00 but I was close enough to my workshop, located down town at the overpriced Radisson. (Columbus Day weekend, non smoking, king size bed w/queen bed sofa sleeper!) The staff were professional and very helpful. They still had my room reserved even though I didn't get in until 2:00am. During my drive, I called the front desk several times because I thought I missed my turn. Miguel, the manager on duty, directed me on the phone (while taking care of other people who were checking in) until I found my way. He said he wanted to make sure I arrived safely because he knew I was traveling alone. They had a wonderful continental breakfast. I would recommend this hotel most definately. When I return to Miami, I will return here. The hotel is located in a safe, tucked out of the way area that is still only 11 min away from downtown.

<Content>Come Hide-A-Way at the Blue Lagoon Stayed for 4 nights. Wonderful staff very friendly and always willing to help with directions and suggestions. Room was clean and large. Free breakfast buffet and free SAFE parking provided. Near the 836 and 826 in the back of MIA airport in the Waterford Corporate Park. 10-15 minutes to the beach - Car needed, although a free bus is available to and from MIA airport. Get a room with a view of the lagoon and U will not be disappointed.
