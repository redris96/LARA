<Content>Run the opposite direction! My god! what a [--}! The smell in the reception as we arrived , the area , next door looked looked like a crack den, sleazy men hanging around. We left after 15 minutes of arriving and cancelled the two rooms booked yet we still got charged, But rather-that then stay at this [--]. There are other nice hotels that are clean for the same price, with a canal view, why do it??

<Content>what a bargain Group of 5 for birthday bash from aylesbury and london..Uopn arrival staff were friendly and helpfull hotel looks good..Rooms are well equipped and clean nd tidy,decorated to a high standard..Beds are comfortable and clean,bedding changed daily and rooms cleaned daily.. Fresh towels every day and more than we needed.. Overall rooms were excellent and the luxury of a plasma tv with sky tv was an extra added bonus.Breakfast was continental and the choice of boiled and scrambled eggs good food and staff freindly and helpfull..Not far from the center and trams and buses are frequent.The hotel and staff are one of the best i have stayed in and will certainly reccomend it to family and frends..In our opinion its at least a 3+ star rating by comparing some of the other hotels we have stayed in in amsterdam.If you are looking for a nice clean good standard hotel in a prime area and for a good price then look up this hotel..you will be suprised................................

<Content>Good stay We stayed at this hotel in August 07. Our room was a quad room and we were very satisfied with it because it was big enough for all of us. The bathboom with a small window was a good size and it had a big bath. It was spotlessly clean and it was very light.There was a big window and we had a wonderful canal view from it. Beds are comfortable.

<Content>Don't stay here! One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in especially for the price, luckily I was only staying one night so spent minimal time in the room.From the outside the hotel looks like a chinese restaraunt, the reception in dark and the lift was a death trap. The room stunk of cigarettes, the handle fell off the shower door, the bathroom was tiny. There was a Ridiculous 37 TV on one wall in the room, with a bed underneath which we wouldn't sleep in as we were scared the TV might fall off!!! Plus my bed was slanted and very uncomfortable. The only plus point was the breakfast was ok, and there were tea and coffee facilities in the room but that is really clutching at straws! We stayed at the falcon as we believed it to be in a convenient location, it is still a ten minute walk to dam square so I suppose it depends where about in the centre you wish to be!All in all if they had spent more on the room and less on the plazma TV maybe thigs would have been a lot better!

<Content>Pleasantly surprised Having had to go to Amsterdam for a few days on business I booked the hotel as part of a package. Once booked I looked further into other reviews of the Hotel and read a few that raised my concerns on the quality of the Hotel. However when I arrived at the Hotel I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. As with most places your first impression is that given to you by the peolpe on reception. In this instance I found the receptionists to be very polite and helpful and this boded well for my stay.My room was very clean and comfortable ( I was on the ground floor) and the bathroom had adequate towels and soap. The plasma tv in the room is not something you would normally expect to see and the room had tea and coffee making facilities as well as a little fridge. It was also nice to open the wardrobe and find a decent quantity of clothes hangers!!.Even though the Hotel was fully booked the only time I heard other guests was in the morning when they were leaving.The buffet breakfast was, as most people have previously reported, above that which you would normally expect and the staff were very courteous and polite. The Hotel does not have a bar but as there was one at the hotel next door this was not a major concern. It does however have a drinks machine and a small snack machine should you get thirsty or peckish during the day or night.As I was not driving I did not need to avail myself of the car parking facilities but the receptionists were very happy to order taxi's for me when needed and they usually arrived within 10 minutes of being ordered. All in all I enjoyed staying at this hotel and would most certainly stay there again.

<Content>Never Again!! When we booked the break through a holiday travel firm, we were told this was the only hotel which had vacancies. When we arrived, I could see why!!Check in was fine, but when we got to the second floor, there were a couple of builders working around the lift. They had laid planks of wood, cabling and plastic pipes right across where we had to go, and didn't offer to move them as we struggled past with suitcases. Not a good start!When we reached the room, it looked ok (at first glance) but on entering the bathroom, it was disgusting. There was dried blood on the wall and the bath was filthy. We cleaned this ourselves, but there is only so much you can do.Breakfast next morning was nothing to write home about either with a very limited choice.We had a great time in the city, but only returned to the hotel when we had to!When we arrived home, I wrote to the travel company to let them know what we had found. This was the first in my life that I have ever complained about a holiday! This is also my only negative view on trip advisor - yes, the hotel really is that bad!!

<Content>nice place We stayed at the Falcon Plaza Hotel last weekend and we've really enjoyed our stay. Although we had been hesitating to book this hotel at the beginning because of the negative reviews, we decided to book it after all, as we liked the location, being in the city-centre, but without the tumult. So, we went ahead and booked it and we are not regretting it at all. We had a wonderful stay in a beatiful room. All rooms had just been refurnished and the whole hotel been renovated. It smelt new and clean and we had a huge flatscreen, so we could watch our favourite program comfortably. We really liked the styling as well as the comfort.We are glad we didn't let us mislead by the old negative reviews, cause this hotel is brand new now and we would definately go back next time to stay there again.

<Content>don't be afraid Don't worry about the previous reviews on this place. Yes the rooms are a little small but they have had a recent renovation and everything was great. It is true that the walls are a little thin, but we had no problems when we were there. The hall ways are a bit dingy, but we never slept in them so things were good. Breakfast was fairly plain but good. The thing that worried me the most reading the other reviews was the cleanlines of the property. This how ever was not an issue, we had fresh towels every day and the room was spotless on arrival. The location of the hotel was also great, nice and close to everything. I almost forgot about the tv. It had to be the biggest plazma I have ever seen in a hotel room. It was an added bonus for sure. So to sum things up don't be afraid of this hotel. The staff were mostly friendly and I enjoyed my stay.

<Content>amsterdam has alot more to offer the breakfast in the morning was fantastic but the rooms were terrible. The first room we had was very dusty and there where condoms outside the window. We moved to another room which I cleaned myself. this room was cramped, the door of the bathroom hit the bed as you opened it. I thought the pictures on the site were misleading. Overall you can get alot better in Amsterdam for alot less, I will not be returning to this hotel.

<Content>Acceptable but below average I stayed three nights at the Falcon in December 2007.My four criteria for any hotel are price, location, safety and cleanliness. I'm sometimes forgiving when it comes to price and location is what it is. Safety and cleanliness are non-negotiables. That having been said, here is the breakdown for the Falcon:1. Price: Amsterdam is an expensive city and this hotel has priced itself in the slightly above average zone.2. Location: It's a short walk (8-15 mins, depending on your pace) to the city centre ie: it's not on your doorstep. There are no shops, cafes etc really near the hotel so if you are not keen on walking, this hotel is not for you.3. Safety: I felt safe during my time at the hotel although there are some side streets nearby that I wasn't crazy about.4. Cleanliness: Room were cleaned out everyday.I'm rating the hotel as below average because as well as all the items listed above, the beds were really, really lousy and some of the service at the front desk was a little brisk (not rude, just not that engaged either)

<Content>Ok, good location ok accomodation! The location is brilliant, half way between rembrandt and the central station, where the canal hoppers start. very quiet hotel, not too many people stay there i dont think, think the scene is a bit strange, i thought the place was closed when we first got there its just the theme of the place is very dark. very nice inside, decent breakfast in the morning. Rooms are very nice looking with very comfo beds, only thing is it smells like the toilet is blocked and the windows do not open. not sure whether this is for every room or not. staff are very helpful but not very chatty. will help you if you need advice. overall an OK accomodation, ideal for stag do`s etc... as its close to most things. red light district is a 5/10 minute walk from the falcon plaza. Overall OK.

<Content>Average Accommodation My husband and l stayed at The Falcon Plaza for three nights. In comparison to the many other hotels we stayed in for our 6 week holiday in the UK  Europe (cost  comfort) this hotel would be one of the worst, especially for the price we paid (not a lot, but certainly not the cheapest place we stayed), it was not good value for money at all, we paid much less for similar hotels in other cities and we paid the same rate for beautiful hotels in some cities. We paid a similar amount for our hotel in Sorrento Italy which had a view of the Bay of Naples, the town of Sorrento and a clifftop pool with view, doesn't seem right. Surely there is something better available in Amsterdam for a bit cheaper or somewhere nicer for the amount we paid. It was in an average location, on a main road with some seedy buildings around it. It is about a 10 minute walk into the heart of the town, which is quite a nice walk. We could hear the toilets flushing in the rooms above and next to ours and the showers. The bathroom was the smallest bathroom we experienced on our travels and the hot water was not regular at all, we had one hot hot shower in three nights. The bed was also very uncomfortable.

<Content>A big disappointment Just came back from Amsterdam. The hotel was listed as a 2 1/2 star but I never thought it would be so bad. The only good thing was the location as it was quite central. But for $250/night Canadian funds, it was a rip off. When we arrived, the room smelled as if someone just smoked a joint there 5 minutes before we checked in. The beds were very so so, felt like blood rushing to my head when I laid down. Not sure if it was the bed or the floor !! Room was large enough - we had 3 single beds for 3 people. The bathroom had a shower door panel missing so we had to shower in a corner of the tub. The toilet kept running half the time. Other than the miniscule closet, there was no other storage. There was a table but no drawers. Our night table had leftover weed in it !!! Brutal. Will never stay there again - Expedia should rate it as a 1 star.

<Content>Nightmare of a Hotel - A long overdue review This was a last minute reservation as we came back to Amsterdam from a trip to Turkey. We couldn't find any other hotels and ended up having to stay here for one of the worst nights ever!! Being on the plane for hours was better than this fetid place. Upon entry, the reception did not give away much and we thought, we can tolerate a hotel we haven't yet scoped out for just one night. As soon as we entered the hallway with rooms however, the scenery changed. A chamber maid was cleaning a room right next door and had casually taken the sheets, towels, you name it and plopped them onto the floor in the middle of the hallway. Yuck!Then we opened the door to our own personal hell. Our hotel room immediately stank of cigarettes and some other odors I don't care to identify. We noticed the carpet was littered with many mystery stains of impressive size. In addition, the window sill was full of cigarette butts, empty wine bottles and odd objects like a hair brush. The bathroom appeared to be clean but at this point we were so disgusted that we decided to shower in our slippers and not take them off unless they were to be replaced with shoes. We're not neat freaks mind you - just normal people that enjoy a healthy dose of hygiene. That night I dared to look at the mattress. What a mistake!! i won't go into the details here but I refrained from telling my husband what I saw lest he sleep standing up, propped against the wall or something. We did however, sleep in our clothes, vampire style with our hands crossed across our chest. Needless to say we were more than eager to get the hell out of this garbage place and get on our flight. I can safely tell you that our economy class seats were more comfortable and clean than that pig sty. We thought of taking pictures but decided against such a reminder of a horrible night on a trip that had been so pleasant. I did want to make sure to warn those who may be going to Amsterdam against this hotel though. Should you go, I highly recommend the hotel right next door or the Amsterdam American hotel. Have fun and stay clear of this place!

The room was clean and warm and had everything we needed for the weekend. Breakfast was simple but filling and the tables were cleared as soon as your bum came off the seat. Id stay here again :)

<Content>Good location but room needed a thorough cleaning Although the location is good, I would not stay here again because the room was dirty, fully of mosquitos (I'm still itching) and there was a lack of security (back door to an unattended garage did not lock, Front desk person gave us the room key without asking for ID). It seems that the property is just poorly managed and maintained.The front desk staff was friendly . One of them sent us to a nearby restaurant , Restaurant Greetje ( Pepperstraat 23) which was excellent - make reservations (tel. --). Cash only - not unusual in AmsterdamThe Ibis Hotel is next door to the Falcon Plaza. It seems to be much cleaner and may be worth investigating.

<Content>it's what you want to make of it!!! Yes other reviews are true, Felt that we paid a premium price to stay here for the type of accomodation that was on offer but we had come to see amsterdam not spend all day in the hotel room although having said that a major hang over on the first night meant that we did not surface till 3pm the next day but we were not disturbed by any maids hoovering or the previously mentioned noisey neighbours in fact the whole stay was rather quite even though the hotel was full over the weekend... the actual room was rather on the small side with the previously mentioned shower room door opening onto the bed but it was clean comfortable and warm and we had fresh towels every day..i,m afraid we can't comment on the breakfast as we never made it once!! the location wasn't as central as we were lead to believe but this was easily overcome by catching the metro approx 5 min walk and getting off at central station and exploring from there onwards.. do have to say though we did feel the location of the falcon plaza was a safe one and we both agreed that we would rather be where we were then right on top of all the action as the location of some of those hotels in the most central parts felt very dodgy!! To sum this experience up i would say this hotel was nothing special and some form of modernization wouldn't go a miss but if it's just a place to put your head down in a clean,comfortable and friendly enviroment then this hotel is fine..

<Content>Depends on what you expect! Me and a group of friends stayed here for a 21st birthday trip to Amsterdam and were happy with what we recieved. Yes the breakfast is VERY limited but they serve the most fabolous chocolate milk. The staff are divided in half, one half are great and you can spend hours talking to, the other half are the total opposite. The location is a slight walk but in a quiet and decent area. There are no crack-heads bothering you for money around here. Wether or not you enjoy your experience here will totally depend on what you want from a hotel. most of the good hotels are based on the outskirts of the city anyway, its mainly only the hostels that are right in the centre, It isnt the best hotel by far but its certainly not the worst either. our friend were scattered around the city as there were limited places available and we payed the least and had the best hotel. Try the Eden or the Atlanta. Not stayed in these but look good for similar price range.The rooms arent very big but are warm. The shower was a death trap, changing from nice warm water to scalding within lighting speed. bath works no problem. Has a good lift, has a safe in the room.....Use it. We didnt mind the walk to places, it doesnt take long, plus lets you see a bit more of the city. i personally thought it was in a good position, it was a five minute walk to everywere, some have attractions near but others miles away.Has a t.v. that doesnt really work. But at the end of the day, it provided a safe environment to lay your head at the end of a night. if youre expecting the ritz then dont stay here, you get what you pay for... It may cost more but its the difference between a good and bad trip,

<Content>an overpriced and certainly over rated rat hole We saved for this trip for months and paid 拢180+ for what was described as a three star hotel - what a joke. The rooms were that small you could not even fully open the bathroom door as it banged of the bed. The walls i think are made of the notes they are ripping people off with! - you could hear everything from the room next door. The maids started hoovering at about 7am so hardly a relaxing stay. Miles from the centre not central as advertised and certainly not worthy of three stars. A complete rip off! don't bother stay at home!

<Content>Very Expensive for what it is Area: Not great, quite a walk to Dam Square and Central Station (I wouldn't want to do it with cases). This hotel is situated on a major (and noisy) roadParking: I was lead to believe it would be free...not so...you'll pay E25 per day...and I wasn't convinced about the security of my car at all.Customer Service: Friendly but not particularly helpful, equal to that of a (above average)hostel.Breakfast: Actually, not bad at all, I enjoyed it (even though I did feel as though I waas sitting in a chinese resturant, very odd.Rooms: It seemed that they had crammed as many beds in each room as possible, I had 4 single beds in my room, I have no idea why, I was taveling alone. I do have to comment on the sheets though, very comfortable...felt as soft as a baby's arse. I slept very well.Decor: Left a LOT to be desired, painting and carpeting was very shoddy and heavily used, it looked like the owner had got a couple of his mates to do the maintenance and they had taken him for a ride, this place seriously feels like a low budget motel, for a high star rated price. I didn't dare us ethe shower for fear of contracting some nasty fungal growth, bathroom was unacceptably dirty (and the light didn't work)I wouldn't stay here again, there are much better and more professional places for the same price

<Content>Not as bad as all that - V.Good value! Just returned from a 3 night stay - Feb 02 to 05. We had 3 twin rooms on the 1st floor paying 55 鈧瑄ros for Thurs, and 80 鈧瑄ros each for Fri  Sat night (210 鈧瑄ros in total per room / 拢75each for 3 nights - which we all thought was good value). Included was a fairly basic buffet style breakfast, (same as mentioned in other reviews). Rooms were fairly small but most are in 'Dam. No views and in a fairly un-picturesque part of the city. However rooms were clean, linen fine, rooms serviced well and fresh towels every day. There was a TV, a wardrobe (with safe), a dressing table but the best feature was the hot power shower - just what you need after a day in the red light district... Toilet was too close to wall/radiator, so you had to ride sidesaddle or risk burning your leg/bum. Staff were mostly Chinese, all spoke English and seemed quite happy to help, (not that we needed to bother them). Reception was open 24hrs and although no bar, the IBIS has one  it's right next-door or there's a Sushi bar 200yrds away. I wouldn't recommend this for a family or a romantic weekend away but if you just need a cheap standard room with good shower located within 10mins walk of the centre then for the price, the place is absolutely fine!

<Content>Not brilliant Just got back from 3 nights in this hotel.Things good:Location - not the most picturesque part of Amsterdam - but only 10 mins walk from the centre.Helpful staff - staff seemed to be trying to be helpful.Free wake up calls.Things bad:No bar - the website we booked with (and several others I have just checked whilst writing this) stated this hotel had a bar - IT DOES NOT! A bar is a good place to meet when there are a few of you - its one of the reasons we chose this hotel over others.We complained to reception - they were not interested and said we should write to the owner.Heat - it was -2 outside but the radiators in the room were barely warm - it was cold.Room size - very little floor space. 2 of us could not get changed or dressed at the same time.Noise - could here exactly what the people in the next room were up to - even though they weren't that loud!Towels - thread bare and with holes.Bathroom - toilet too near to the wall and not enough leg room. Anyone over 6 foot tall can't sit on it!Lift - old style where you manually open the door and with nothing protecting you from the moving wall on one side. Not for kids.Stairs - IMHO not suitable for children at all - wide bending staircase with very small steps on one side that would be easy to miss and fall on.I lost my footing once and grabbed the handrail - it came away from the wall.Breakfast - limited selection continental. Bread and rolls, dutch taost, couple of jams, butter, cold hard boiled eggs in shells, 1 cheese and 2 cooked meats. Some cerial and a couple of fruit juices. Plus hot drinks. Not the biggest selection I have ever seen and very little that really appeals. We only ate here once and chose to eat in town and pay the extra.No batteries in the TV remote control - one of my pet hates as its such an easy thing to get right!Smoky smell - apprently the day before some guests had dropped cigarettes down the lift well which caught fire. Consequently the hall way and lift smelt very strongly of smoke. Apparently they had just got the lifts working - would not recommend this hotel if the lifts are out of order - see comments on stairs.Overrall condition - hotel seemed tired and worn. Lots of things seem to look very used / chipped / cracked / loose etc. Attention to detail in the cleaning could be better. From stories I have heard this hotel is a long way from being the worst in Amsterdam. But there are better for similar money too.We had a great weekend - but that was down to the good company and Amsterdam being a great City.

<Content>NO STARS JUST ONE BIG BLACK HOLE I wouldnt even rate this hotel as a 1* let alone the 3* it is supposed to be, it is just a big black hole and shouldnt be allowed to trade. Don't be deceived by the appearance of a smart enterance/reception area as past this the rooms are not even fit for a dog to sleep in. The rooms are dirty and the curtains and bedding were stained and ripped. The shower area was dirty and complete with mould and previous residents belongings. I think this says it all. The location wasnt great but OK so I would suggest you try booking into the IBIS which is next door.

<Content>"Tatty old B My partner  I paid 420 euro to stay 3 night's in what I can only call a shambles. Our room was so small only one of us could move around at a time whilst the other had to sit on the bed. The bathroom door only opened half as it jammed against the bed. The towel's in the bathroom were worn thin and stank. The whole interior of this place is ancient.... paint on wall's very dirty, carpets filthy and worn. Bed clothes were really old. When we booked, it advertised a bar......which they did have, only it was closed down. I wouldn't stay here again if it were free. This is supposed to be a 3* hotel. In Ireland it would not even be rated as a BB. Please do yourself a favour and stay in the Ibis next door. It is bright, clean and very friendly. I would give this hotel 2 out of 10 and that's just for location........nothing else!!

<Content>Over Expensive Bad hotel So we went to Amsterdam. Not having thousands to spend, we found what we thought would be a good little joint (Pardon the pun!) to stay in for the week. The reviews had been mixed before we went but we thought that we should go for it!So we got there... got lost trying to find it, and on arrival a HUGE pile of rubbish bags and trash awaited us... as a refuge collection strike happened to be on at the time. Not their fault, but no attempt to hide it away or even sweep it out of the way, just left it in the path.When we entered, wasn't too fussed with the interior, seemed pretty o.k. based on the outside, got our room key from a women who didn't even know we were coming even though we pre-booked before.... Got to the room by using a rickety old lift that would be more suited to... well nothing, and was shocked at the state of the room compared to what we were paying. O.k, so we weren't expecting the hilton or anything, but the bathroom was dirty, bed was dirty, window was cracked and the wardrobe was kicked in and looked like it had been taped back together!Myself and brother were not going to pay 拢100.00 a night for this, so we (After reading GOOD reviews) decided to go next door (Like many others) to the hotel ibis. On route with our bags, a man who I can only guessed owned the place tried to rugby tackle my brother for walking out with the bags while I gave them the key back.... customer service at it's best!!Cutting a long story to a short end, we walked out - we were never charged a cancellation fee as they never took our bank details (haha!) and had a wonderful week in the Hotel Ibis. You live and you learn ;-)

<Content>Dirty, Poorly Maintained Pit Myself and my partner booked in for 2 nights, for 拢50 per night for the room. After booking in and speaking the unhelpful receptionist who decided to lay down the 'rules' of the hotel like she was speaking to a 5 year old, we checked out our room. As i opened the door, i found the tv wall mounting falling off the wall, which had been propped up with the floor lamp. i reported this to reception who sent the maintanance man, he then proceeded to readjust the lamp and ignore the fact that there was a tv 6 foot off the floor mounted in plasterboard which had half fallen out. i had to tell him to remove the tv in fear of it falling off the stand in the middle of the night. We then checked the rest of the room to find stained pillows and bed linen, dirty greasy hand prints all over the room and suspicious stains on the seat in the room! All through this we had noticed a buzzing noise which we thought was road works, i then opened the window to find some venting system 2 foot from the room which was NEVER turned off, and it resulted in 2 very bad nights sleep for both of us. Then to the bathroom which had cracked tiles, bad odours when the toilet was flushed and a shower which could'nt be used for more than 45 seconds as the drain was blocked.Also they don't have any tea/coffee facilites in the room or a bar/restaurant in the hotel but do have some over priced vending machines. But the Hotel Ibis next door did and looked to be a much nicer and cleaner hotel.Take my advice and book elsewhere, i'm sure some other rooms may be in slighty better condition but would'nt take that chance, this place needs ripping out and totally refurbishing.

<Content>Hotel? Please... Stop trading! Stayed in this supposed hotel for two nights. It is DIRTY!! A Cesspool of filth, suffice to say it is a health hazard! The building is dated and hence the room! Feels like a shoe box to say the least! Went with my partner and it wasn't pretty sharing such a small room! Thought we'd at least have some view in our window... Ciggarette butts and spliff butts littered the window sill all along to the next room and the next room and so on... No complementary tea facilities in the room, bed linen dirty, towels threadbare and smelly. Lift broke down and there was hardly any communication between staff and guests; only a barely readable paper stuck on the lift door. Customer services for you! To top it all up; I felt like a real bozo for staying in this God forsaken place because good old hotel Ibis was just next door! Wouldn't recommend it for any one. I paid almost 拢350 for two nights and oh yes I am miffed by the service I got or in fact lack of it! Moreso, I am miffed by the fact that I have been misinformed by the hotel as to its standard and star ratings! It is not even worthy of hostel status!

<Content>ICK. Some positives about this hotel - restaurant and reception area were clean and modern. Close to downtown but there are lots of hotels close to downtown. Very close to the Hermitage Amsterdam and the Hortus and one of the outdoor markets. Room - not great, small, not much room to hang up clothes, bathroom never clean enough, shower head had amazing power which was great IF it stayed in the holder - when you turned up the water pressure full blast the shower head jumped off the holder and could kill someone, there was so much pressure. I'm sure it sounds like I'm exaggerating but I'm not - my husband has been telling stories aobut this since we've gotten back. Staff - mostly made us feel like we were a problem to deal with not people they would like to help. One good staff person was a young European man who was helpful when I needed to call my parents in North America and tell them we were OK and left London before the bombings. The rest of the staff at the desk really acted like they couldn't care less about us. I don't know what prices are in Amsterdam since this was our only hotel but surely there can be better hotels for this price.

<Content>Get What You Pay For Come on, Instead of running this hotel into the ground, lets be honest, It was cheap. and if you pay for cheap, you get cheap.A group of eleven of us stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in May 2004. We wanted somewhere with a central location that was a reasonable price. That is exactly what the falcon plaza gave us. There were no frills. You got what you paid for. The rooms were basic, but clean, and breakfast plentiful.Don't come expecting the ritz because you will be disappointed. But good value for money is its selling point.

<Content>Great Service Great hotel Falcon Plaza may be an average hotel in appearance but the service given by the staff was well above average. The receptionist gave us great information as where to go and the best way to get there. The rest of the Hotel staff were very friendly and polite. would definately recommend it especially if your only using it to kip there on a night. We booked the quad room as we went with 2 kids. If travelling with kids this is definately a must as you dont get the usual rowdy crowd that come with the cheaper end of hotels.

<Content>Great Value for Money After reading some of the reviews of this hotel after we booked our girlie weekend for December i had some reservations, but as soon as we arrived the management we very helpful and the room we had booked was ready early and was large, warm and clean. We only paid 100 Euros each for two nights bed and very good continental breakfast and i feel that we definatley got alot more for our money. The hotel in under new management and i would definatley recommend it to anyone who is looking to stay in a central location in amsterdam on a budget, i will use this hotel in future.

<Content>A good value for money hotel I have just returned from an excellent weekend break in Amsterdam with my sister in law and two friends. I would rate this hotel as above average for what we paid to stay there. I don't know what some people expect for 拢34 per night - we were pleasantly surprised when this amount also included a continental breakfast. If you want 5* luxury, then you have to pay for it I am afraid! Check-in was excellent. We arrived about 3 hours earlier than we should have done at the hotel, but fortunately our room was ready for occupation, so the reception staff handed over the key and allowed us to deposit our luggage immediately. Our quad room was quite basic, but very clean and comfortable, and the bed linen was changed following each night of stay. There were also plenty of clean towels each day in the bathroom. The reception staff were very friendly and accommodating and spoke good English. The hotel was fairly centrally located (compared to some cities I have stayed in) and we did not feel at all wary walking around in a small group late at night. I would definitely stay in this hotel again should I return to Amsterdam in the future and would not hesitate in recommending it to my friends and family who were thinking of visiting this city.
