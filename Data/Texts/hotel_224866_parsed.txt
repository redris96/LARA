<Content>Off the beaten path If you are tired of the Marriott, Sheraton scene, try this place.Newly remodeled with a GREAT restaurant!We have stayed at this hotel before remodel and after the remodel. What a difference. The staff is lovely - very friendly.Even if you don't stay here - take a cab over just for the restaurant. They have a kitchen staff that is great. The chef came to our table and asked if we wanted anything that wasn't on the menu. We went with menu fare and we were not disappointed. We were traveling with the PICKIEST eater I have ever met and she cleaned her plate! Try the steaks - you won't be disappointed.MJDenver

<Content>lively hotel, very helpful staff This small hotel offered a great place to stay for proximity to the airport, great views and beach access, and a lively bar (but no noise when we were ready for shut-eye). The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. We were actually checking out Thanksgiving morning, and they still served a great breakfast to us on that holiday. Later after we left, I realized I had left behind a brand new pair of running shoes, and they located them and held them for two days for me while we were on Vieques. Wonderful!

<Content>Love of the ocean Hotel La Playa is a great place to stay. We have stayed there with the old owners and the new owners. We have never been disappointed, in fact have been going there for 8yrs or better. Its great! The new owners are fabulous and have done a wonderful job on renovating. Both Husband and wife are very hard workers keeping the place on the up and up. Food was super,bartenders great,waiters especially Angel the best, housekeeping is great and Margareet will bend over backwards for you. Linda on the front desk is another super person,will bend over backwards for you and knows all the answers and will help you if you ask. Another super person, the chef Alberto is great always asking is everthing ok. His food is so yummy!!The new owners Monica and Alberto are great and very friendly. Alberto works very hard to accomodate everyone and is doing a great job on renovating. A real hard working man!!!!! Lots to do and see....the beach is super and chair rental $4 at the beach, bus A5 to San Juan is easy to take and fun. Great shopping in Old San JuanWe love it so much we are going back for another week in Feb. Can't wait. All I can say is go and enjoy ,everything is super.....hotel, food, shopping, beach and more. ENJOYOops almost forgot the band on Saturday night is super lots of fun

<Content>Don't walk - RUN AWAY!! I have traveled around the world, and have never met with such lack of consideration for hotel guests as I found in this hotel. I booked three nights in June, for part of a family vacation with my wife and two kids. The first night my wife and older son were kept awake until about 4:00 a.m. by the loudest possible power tools and even what my wife thought was a jack-hammer, pouding away at concrete. I thought there must've been a construction crew at the building under construction next door. I know it sounds crazy, but what else could it be?The next morning we told the hotel manager and she seemed to know immediately what it was, and she would make sure that didn't happen again. Apparently there was work going on the new woden floor.That night, we were again woken up around 2:00 a.m. to these horrible skreeching sounds. This time I got dressed and went downstairs to the restaurant and, lo and behold, there's a crew sanding the new wooden floor with the loudest power sander you can imagine, and another guy breaking a concrete wall with a jack-hammer. I had to explain that there was no way anybody could sleep with the noise they were making, and that it was 2:00 a.m. and I had a right to quiet. I then laid on the night manager - he didn't like it but desisted and sent the crew home.How is it possible to have that mindset and be in the hospitality industry? I asked to talk to the hotel owner the next day, and he couldn't find a way to sincerely apologize - like he's never said 'sorry' in his life. We were ready to leave this hotel for something else, but he promised it would not happen again, and he would not charge us for the past two nights. We'll, I guess promises don't count for much in La Playa, since they charged us the highest rate ($169) for two nights instead of the one night we had agreed upon. Needless to say, that was not compesation enough for the horrible nights we spent there.I would never go to this hotel again and I won't recommend anything about it - not the rooms, not the restaurant, with our missed meals and slow service.Go somewhere else!!!

<Content>cheap hotel, beach across the street, cute bar I stayed in a room with two double beds with three other friends: it was a budget vacation. But we enjoyed La Playa's location across the street from a decent beach that was very swimmable. The hotel itself was nothing to write home about, but it was clean, quiet, and had a nice bar where locals hung out and you could get some stiff drinks. We enjoyed many evenings out on the lovely patio that offers spectacular sunset views. The breakfast that the hotel laid out was very spartan and again, nothing to write home about: some pale muffins, boxed cereal, basic white rolls, coffee, juice. The courtyard of this little budget hotel was nice, with pretty hibiscus and other flowering plants. I saw a few lizards, but none made it into the room. There was a roofdeck that we went up to on occasion, but it was very spartan.The beds were comfortable enough, but the room was extremely basic: beds, dresser, and a bathroom with only a shower. But for the budget trip we took, it was fine.I have probably outgrown a place like La Playa but I would recommend it for young travelers in a group.

<Content>Low budget, Great beach!! We stayed at the Hotel LaPlaya for 6 days in February and it had it's great points and it's not so great points. The rooms were a bit to be desired. outdated for sure, but nice view of the ocean. we had a front room which overlooked the parking lot and the street as well as the ocean. the downside? sometimes loud people and the hotel dumpster. At one point the dumpster was overfilled. I understand that they are revamping the place but that was very uncomfortable to say the least. The hotel phone did not have a cord, needless to say no phone service. Not that I needed it, but our wake up call was a knock at the door. We did improvise!!The bar was great as well as the staff. They make the best Pina Colada's!! The last night there we had a waiter from Minnesota!!we talked to people that were staying at other hotel's but came to ours for the view and the atmospher. The food was great as well.It would be beneficial to keep your A/C on at night to tune out the outside noise. many locals outside due to the fact that there are apartments and houses right in the area.

<Content>Close to teh airporty and a beautiful beach If you're looking for a low budget place to stay by the airport but still have access to a great beach, Hotel la Playa is a good option. The rooms are boring but the bar downstairs is right on the ocean. You can drink your pina coladas on top of the waves and the bartenders are fabulous. It is however, a little bit noisy at night. I suggest sleeping with the windows closed and the airconditioner on to drown out the partyers on the weekends. Either that, or join the party.Hotel la Playa is now under new management and the new owners intend on fixing the place up, with a new kitchen and spa. I'm curious t see how they do with the place.

<Content>Plastic Curtains and Bathroom Odors overshadow Great Pina Coladas There really is only one reason you would pick to stay here - the price. It's extremely reasonable for it's location (which you should note, is not on the beach....it is across the street from the beach) If all you're looking for is a place close to the beach that has a Pina Colada bar, and you plan on spending very very little time in your room, then you might do okay here, because.....You will not want to spend time in your room. So if you're staying here, plan on leaving early in the morning (the beach across the street really is quite fantastic) and having drinks at the bar at night (the bar is nice enough, though the staff is so laid back the service can be painfully slow). Don't stay in the rooms close to the lobby bathroom however, because you will be haunted by the odor of toilet cakes. Drapes on the windows are plastic, rooms are pretty dark and damp (sort of depressing) and the beds are low budget jobs.Be careful taking advice from the wily old guy behind the counter. He advised me over the phone not to rent a car from the airport because of an airport tax. He advised me to take a cab from the airport and rent a car off site. He also suggested never taking a cab to old San Juan because the bus is so much cheaper and easier. I took his advice about the rental car which is one of the stupidest travel decisions I've made so far this century. The airport tax turned out to be minimal, especially after his secret car rental places turned out to be more expensive than my already cancelled travelocity reservation. Cab from airport: $15.Buses to/from old San Juan: $0 - (a waste of time, I never took the bus) Cabs I took to/from San Juan: $90 (6 rides)Rental Car rented after realizing how much cabs were: $120 (2 days)Hotel in Old San Juan after cancelling last night stay at La Playa: $180Cab back to airport: $20My original car reservation from airport was $100 in total.Puerto Rico is great though, but my advice is to stay somewhere else.

<Content>Not a great location La Playa looks to be ideal, at the tip of a point in Isla Verde. Unfortunately, the property itself does not sit on beach, but on some rocks. At the same time, the distance to the beach is very short, so that is not really a problem.Getting there, though, requires going through the street, which is isolated and tends to be well populated by collections of unsavory groups at night. If parking is not available (a lot for 5 cars, along with street parking), there is a lot, but it is two blocks away and not lit, and when we were there, it held three cars that had been trashed.We had a completely event-free stay, so I cannot suggest that it is unsafe, but we never did feel comfortable. I doubt I would stay there again.The continental breakfast consisted of a slice of white bread, juice and coffee. There was no internet availability.

<Content>Great view We had a view of the ocean, it was great! The room was average, not fancy at all and the bathrooms needed to be updated. We thought a $100 for an ocean view was not bad at all and the resturant was fun. We would go down every night and watch the live music and listen to the ocean. The food and drinks were great. It also wasn't that busy, which was a plus for us. Your not going to find a ocean view this cheap. I do agree with the comment about the parking, they really didn't have too much parking.

<Content>Urinal Cakes! My husband and I went to PR on our honeymoon in June. For the first six days we stayed in Northwestern PR, trusted TriAdvisor, and had the most romantic time imaginable. For the last three days we went to San Juan and followed Fodor's advice - big mistake! We stayed at Hotel La Playa and were horrified. We were placed in a 'bungalow' which wqas actually a cement shack in the center of the courtyard that reeked, and I repeat reeked, of urinal cakes. When we came home even the clothes that were clean smelled disgusting from that room. Outside of our room there were definately 'unsavory' types hanging out until 3 o'clock in the morning. I didn't sleep at all because each time I drfited off it sounded like someone was about to try to come into our room. Thankfully, nobody ever did, but it was scary. While the view outside the bar is nice enough, it is surrounded by razor wire - not a comforting sight. Overall, I agree with a previous reviewer when I say that a 1 is way too high of a rating for this place. I wish I had checked TripAdvisor before going instead of just trusting Fodor's. I cannot stress enough that nobody should stay here, it is simply not safe and it is not what they advertise (besides being filthy the continental breakfast is bread and coffee).

<Content>Nasty Nasty and Nasty I stayed there 03-28-07 till 04-01-07. The place is horrible. They lock you in if you are staying on the second floor at night. No hot water, the place is not dirty but filthy, the continental breakfast is sliced bread and boxed cereal (muffins are $1.00). People hangout in front of the Hotel that are unsavory. There are five parking spotsin front for guests and employees. The rooms need an overhaul from Mr. Clean. The mattresses are throw-a-ways from the Marriot. The cleaning lady refreshed the towels every day and made up the beds. Ijust wished she cleaned too. I stayed in Room 101, 207 and 204. I have been backpacking in Europe and have never slept under these conditions.

<Content>Never Again! We arrived at Hotel La Playa at about two a.m., without our luggage (which had been lost by the airline.) The man who was working that night was extremely unfriendly and acted annoyed that we would bother him to check in to his hotel. As for the room... it was a good size and had one whole wall of windows overlooking the ocean, but the windows were nailed shut. There were bugs in the sheets of one of the beds and the shower and bathtub were dirty with mildew and rust. It is very close to the airport, so close that the jets taking off shook our room and made it hard to sleep. My husband and I are budget travelers and were not expecting five star accomodations, but at $109 for one night this was the not only the most expensive but also the worst place we stayed on our 10 day trip to Puerto Rico. You can find much nicer places for the same price or less, even in the Isla Verde or Condado areas. (Andalucia Guest House, or At Wind Chimes Inn, or Casa del Caribe, to name a few.) We were also traveling with our two young children, and this property is not geared for families. Had the front desk help been polite it would have been a much different experience. We will not stay here again.They do have a nice bar overlooking the ocean.

<Content>Filthy room The hotel is somewhat run-down, though in a decent location. Unfortunately the room we had was quite dirty -- dirt on the floor, trash under or by the bed, somebody else's toiletries left in the bathroom. It was a bit noisy. The good side: convenient to the airport. Not terribly convenient to Old San Juan or the main tourist section of Condado. The hotel is directly on what seemed to be a decent beach.

<Content>My best friend and I loved it I stayed at La Playa with my best friend for six nights. I had heard about the hotel from a friend of mine who went to PR but did not stay there. Anyways, we gave it a shot relying only on advice and the information on tripadvisor. Its location is fantastic,right on the water. We spent most of the time at the bar in the terrace overlooking the ocean. Our room was clean, and I am very finnicky about these things. Their food is good, mostly fire-grilled items. They dont have breakfast, only continental, but there is a Dennys a short walking distance. Parking can be a problem if you are renting a car, like we did. You may end up parking a couple of blocks away. Puertorricans were very friendly to us, and are very festive. We stayed in a room with no view the first couple of nights, but then the manager personally moved us to one of the ocean front rooms. He wanted to make sure we were pleased, and we were after the change. If you book there, ask for an ocean front! The bartender is the sort of person that memorizes the names of the guests. It gave the bar a feel of a Cheers at the Beach! She even got to know the story behind my divorce. My point being, I felt very comfortable at the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to couples, and small families. If you do go, tell Margarita that Diane says hello.

<Content>Good choice for us two First time to PR, definitely not our last. We are a young married couple, managiing our finances, on a strict budget, from Orange County, Calif. We flew to PR to catch a cruise, and got there three days early to visit PR. I booked directly with La Playa. They got us one of their ocean front rooms at a very good price. The hotel shares the same beach as the Intercontinental which obviously we could not afford. The room was very clean and the attendant, Dave was very responsive and courteous (considering he is from NYC). The hotel had a very laid back, leave your worries behind feel to it. The bar is in a terrace that leads to the ocean. Food at their restaurant was reasonably priced, we had lunch there, but had dinner at the more trendy restaurants in Isla Verde. The hotel is not new, so dont expect in-room movies, but our room was cleaned daily. Also, the room does not have an iron, something which we found out after we took a shower and were about to get dressed. we had to check it out from the front desk. Also, no coffee maker in the room. You have to get the coffee downstairs. I am from the west coast, so I was expecting to find a Tijuana kind of place. Nope, I was wrong, this is up to par with any bed and breakfast in America. Be sure to ask for extra pillows because the room only has two thin ones. Other than that, we were happy with our call.

<Content>Hotel La Playa was nice My best friend  I stayed at Hotel La Playa for 5 days during the beginning of December for a relaxing, beach vacay. We had hot water the entire time, our room was CLEAN, our beds were CLEAN  the staff was friendly. One of the housekeepers even provided some large, CLEAN beach towels for us from the linen closet in the laundry room. I was so shocked to read the bad reviews from other travelers, I had to write about our experience. The bar downstairs was nice, met some great people  drank ice cold Medalla. I wish I was there now!We ate great food at Metropol  the gelato place near by. If you have a car to visit Kasalta's in Ocean Park, you definitely should! It is an authentic  fantastic place, the pastry case makes you weak in the knees. Get some little sandwiches or a bear claw and go off and experience Puerto Rico!!If you don't want to leave the comfort/familiarity of your own house --- then you shouldn't travel!! Hotel La Playa wasn't a luxurious Ritz Carlton resort, it was a simple, clean  friendly hotel.

<Content>False Advertising! If you are expecting this 'budget hotel' to be of the American standards of a Comfort Inn or Days Inn, then you will be very disappointed by Hotel La Playa! The pictures on the Hotel La Playa website are deceiving. In reality, my room was not particularly modern or clean, had a thin mattress that was sub-par for hotel standards, and there were little bugs in the room. You will get only the basics in the room (bed, tv, phone, dresser). There is no clock/radio, no washcloths, only one trash can, and no tissues. There are guesthouses in the San Juan area that are a better value, so do your research before making a reservation here!

<Content>Be Warned!!! I just returned from a stay at Hotel La Playa. Their website and various web reviews made it sound like it was a decent, yet affordable, place to stay on Isla Verde. I was highly disappointed in my experiences at the hotel. It is no oasis, as their website claims. The rooms are dirty, the sheets are dirty, there were spiders, mosquitos, and ants in the room/shower and the mattress was thin and flimsy. It was difficult to get hot water in the shower and there was almost no water pressure. When I complained about the problems, the person at the front desk acted as though there was nothing he could do. I also learned that the hotel uses solar power to heat their water so if it's a cloudy day, don't expect hot (or warm) water in the shower. One final warning - the bar area can get very loud and you'll be able to hear everything in the room when you're trying to get to sleep.

<Content>Good Location, Clean Rooms, Slow Bar Service As long as you aren't expecting a modern beach resort with all the amenities, this is an excellent choice for the price. The room and the rest of the hotel were exceptionally clean, and the staff was (mostly) friendly and efficient.The hotel is located at the end of the main Isla Verde beach where the Courtyard Marriott and Intercontinental Beach Resort are located. A quick two-minute walk puts you on the beach in front of those hotels, and you can use their beach bars if you wish. But Hotel La Playa has it's own beach bar with an awesome view of the water. I had the burger for lunch, and it was excellent - and much less expensive than the $14 Cuban sandwich that I had at the Intercontinental earlier in the week.The room was small but very clean and had more than enough closet space. The TV was on a wall mount similar to a Super 8 motel room, but the cable worked and the picture was clear - besides, who goes to the beach to spend their time watching TV?There was an ironing board in the closet, but no iron, but my business travel was over by the time I stayed here and I didn't need to press my clothes anyway. The bathroom was fine. The shower was more of a mist than a shower, and it took a good five minutes for the water to warm up, but these are just minor annoyances, not complaints. Again, for a third of the price of the cheapest beach resort room, the room was more than adequate.The hotel offers free parking. If there's no parking in their half-dozen street spots, the bartender or desk clerk will give you a key to a locked parking lot. Unfortunately, I showed up mid-day Saturday when the spots were full and the street was jammed. Rather than park illegally, I payed $5 to park a few blocks away since I didn't know the hotel had free parking. But, I spent the previous couple of days at the Hampton Inn where guests pay $5 to park anyway. (I was able to move my car to the street-side parking a couple of hours later.)Isla Verde Avenue is a short 5-minute walk through a residential neighborhood. At first, the area seemed a bit sketchy with bars on windows and not a lot of lighting, but I never felt uncomfortable, and there were always other people walking.The only somewhat negative experience I had was with the bartenders - very slow and more concerned about slicing limes for the evening rush than looking around to see customers lined up at the bar. The entire bar was also entertained by a loud argument between the bartender going off-duty and bartender coming on-duty. The evening bartender was surly, just shy of being rude, and she was even slower than the afternoon bartender. Customers left after sitting with empty glasses while the bartenders fought. The Blue Dolphin is another beach bar just a few steps away, but service is only marginally better.SUMMARY - Great hotel for the price, but walk down the beach for food and drinks if you're looking for decent service.

<Content>Not Bad...Not Bad At All We stayed at Hotel La Playa while in Puerto Rico for a friend's wedding. They were staying further down the beach at Casa de Playa (in other words, we and another couple booked the wrong hotel!--and I'm glad we did!!!). The other couple we were with only stayed one night and chose to move to the Water Club for the rest of the week (for $280/night)--their room at Hotel La Playa was definately small and their shower didn't work so they were outta there. Our room was not so small, clean, and comfortable enough with a teeny-tiny bathroom (with a shower that did work)--but we were on the street side and it was quite noisy into the wee hours of the morning (even over the noise of the old AC) with the bar next door so we requested a move to the oceanside and were in for a pleasant surprise--a very spacious room with a huge closet/dressing area and large bathroom w/shower  tub. At $125/night it was a good deal-considering everything else down the beach was in the $280-$450 range).Hotel La Playa is first and foremost-clean. I never saw one cockroach or any other bugs for that matter. Our bedding was clean (although they could invest in some softer sheets), towels and bathroom were clean and room service was evereyday and thorough. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. You just had to ask questions (i.e., where are beach towels, where is ice, etc.)--and it did help to know a little Spanish (although usually, the dest clerk spoke English). Everytime I walked through the place, there was some sort of cleaning of the grounds and main area going on as well. It's just not really they kind of place that you would write home about--decor is dreary, and, with the exception of the bathrooms, updating hasn't probably been done since 1960's--but who spends time in their rooms when there's a beach beckoning? A new paint job, some brighter curtains, new window slats that work so there's the option of having the window open instead of only AC to cool off (although the noisy AC's have one thing going for them--I can't hear my husband snore!)--those would all make this place a very pleasant place. As it was, it was acceptable and for the price, worth it.Location: Perfect--you had your choise of two long stretches of beach. Morning walks on the beach were great--you could walk for over an hour or more if you wanted to along nothing but beach. The beach bar was perfect and I loved bringing my breakfast down to the deck in the mornings and just watching the ocean, sitting in the sun. A very quiet time (with the exception of airplanes taking off  landing -- and to think I could stay at the Ritz or Marriot for $450/night and be even closer to the airport!!!) Safety: Arrived back at the hotel at 2:00am one time and they had locked a barred gate across the entrance (plus all the windows are barred)--the desk clerk let us in. Made me feel a bit safer. Food: Breakfast was a joke--just went down the street a couple of blocks to a great little Gelato and breakfast/sandwich place that also made lattes and were very friendly. We never had the chance to eat at their restaurant, but it looked like it was decent. Would I Go Back? If I stayed in San Juan--yes. Why? Because it's all about the beach and the touring. It's like staying in a little old motel with the best location on the beach. Then go use the beach chairs at the Water Club and chill and use all the money you saved to eat out (because that's not cheap either in San Juan!).

<Content>Great Spot I stood at this hotel in February for 3 days with my sisters and although I was a lil hesitant at first once I got there I was very pleased. The room we got was nice and big, ac worked just fine, bathroom was clean, absolutely no complaints. At such an affordable price and RIGHT on the beach you can not go wrong. I never tried the breakfast tho since we choose to just walk down the block and eat at Dennys then at night we would eat at restaurants in the area but we did have lunch once and it wasn't bad. They have their own bar which was great especially to start off the night or finish it. Try an Over the Top I got hooked : ) and you can chill at the deck always a nice breeze, but at night get out that bug spray the mosquitoes were NO JOKE! Overall I would def come here again and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay for a few days in Isla Verde and not wanting to dish out the $200+ bucks at some of the other hotels.

<Content>Yecch! Hotel La Playa had a seedy feel to it from our first moment. When we first walked into our room, the smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming. We were surprised when, a moment after commenting on that, the maid emerged from the bathroom with a cigarette dangling from her lip!The bed was uncomfortable and the sheets were itchy. The bathroom was sketchy enough to warrant wearing flip-flops in the shower. The drinks from the bar tasted like rubbing alcohol even though I specifically ordered 2nd shelf liquor. Overall, the place is just a dive.Like other travelers, we were on a tight budget. Our last night in San Juan we stayed at a gorgeous guest house (Andalucia) in Ocean Park. It was the EXACT SAME PRICE and worlds apart. Trust me, you do not need to punish yourself with a stay at Hotel La Playa just to save money!

<Content>Not bad, great location Great location, great deck right on the water. Rooms basic for the price, ok if do not want to pay the higher prices at the surrounding hotels. The room I got though had a smell and the bathroom could have been cleaner, hair here and there that easily could have been cleaned. Hair on the towels and pillowcase as well. Again, great location with easy beach access for the price. Hopefully the other rooms are better than the one I got. Paid $98/night for one person.

<Content>Great location for the price... My family and I stayed here for two nights in August. First let me say, the location can't be beat, as you are right across from the beach! The room was very clean, the beds were comfortable, and the a/c worked just fine. The hotel staff was friendly. I was worried about the airplane noise being so close to the airport, but you didn't even notice with the a/c turned on. The worst part of this hotel was the continental breakfast. I've had continental breakfast's in Puerto Rico, U.S., England and France and this was by far the worst! The coffee was weak, o.j. watered down and the only thing you didn't have to pay a $1 for was some tasteless bread which came with stale tasting butter and jelly that had been hanging around to long. Needless to say, we didn't even want to try the lunch or dinner because of that experience. We ended up walking down to Isle Ave and found a great cafe on the corner which served breakfast/lunch/dinner and has wonderful gelato. The other problem was noise from the hotel bar and neighboring hotel bar on the Friday night. Isle Verde neighborhood didn't impress me too much and I probably wouldn't stay there again. The only great thing is that it's close to the airport and has a nice beach. If you don't mind skipping the breakfast and want a cheap clean place to stay near the beach then I would recommend staying here, otherwise look elsewhere.

<Content>If yuo need more.....you already have too much I'm a school teacher on a you guessed it tight budget, who went to Puerto Rico for a week. I had no reservations past the first 2 nights before I happened to stumble into Hotel La Playa. As I entered and passed the Playita Bar and walked out onto the deck I new this was the place for me, great location. Inexpensive, clean and comfortable. The staff made sure that I had everything I needed to make my stay a memorable one. They gave me very accurate information on places to go and things to do on my own so that I could avoid the usual tourist prices.

<Content>Great Little Place Right on the Beach If you are used to four or five star accomodations, do not visit this hotel. The only extra ammenities this hotel offers is the free coffee and tea for breakfast. You will have to get up early to catch the cereal and bread that cost $1 each. But! if you are looking for a clean and cheap room with a great location (right on the beach!) you cannot beat this hotel. The staff (although they did not speak english) was very very nice and helpful. They supplied us (three girls, aaah!) with all the towels we needed. The deck where they served meals had a view of the ocean that was amazing! The food wasn't anything to write home about, the bar was well stocked and very accessible. This hotel was not our first choice, we found it after a horrible one night stay at Coral by the Sea. Even though the other two would not return to this hotel, I would because my two main concerns were met for a three night stay: clean room, accessibility to the beach. A nice added benefit was the accomodating staff. I have to mention the other girls' concerns: telephone did not work, cramped bathroom, the beds could have been firmer, could've used a fridge.

<Content>Adequate for the price We recently returned from 5 nights at Hotel La Playa. For $125/night, it was clean and comfortable. We never had any problems parking and the location can't be beat. I personally felt that the airplane noise began to wear on my nerves by the end of our stay, but that's certainly not the fault of the hotel...it's possible that the bigger (more expensive) resorts have the same problem.I didn't find the staff as warm and friendly as others have reported, but they weren't rude. The hotel restaurant did have very good food in a nice, relaxed atmosphere. I found the included breakfast to be a little bit lacking, but it was certainly acceptable...and it was free.Overall, I was a little bit disappointed with the Isla Verde neighborhood...for the most part, the only food options were fast food (Pizza Hut and Burger King) or super-expensive resort food. If we were to visit Puerto Rico again, I would want to try another area (such as Condado) or another part of the island.
