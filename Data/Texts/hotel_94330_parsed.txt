<Content>Highly recommeded! This was my first trip back to the hotel in a couple of years and I was very impressed with the improvements/renovations. The room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel lobby and lounge area were spacious and inviting. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, especially to my elderly mother who was travelling with me. I will definitely stay here on my next trip to Boston!

<Content>A hotel with a health club that does things differently I stayed at the Seaport when I couldn't get a room at a different hotel. The rooms were nice and the staff were friendly. However, I was pleasently surprised by some of the other aspects of my stay. The first thing I noticed is that this hotel has a somewhat green attitude. You can recycle your newspaper and other misc stuff. I appreciated this because most hotels tend to be very wasteful.The hotel also discourages tipping. This is a little strange and I left a tip for housekeeping anyway, but I would guess that they must do a reasonable job of compensating their staff. OK, all the other stuff is nice, but the best thing about this hotel is the health club. It has free weights, cardio machines, weight machines, spin classes and a lap pool. The health club is not huge, but it is fantastic by hotel/resort standards. All this was included in the price. No better way to burn off some stress and some of the calories from work-related travel!If I had to give an overall summary, I would say that people who are really interested in luxury might find this hotel only adequate. I really appreciated some of the characteristics that make this hotel different.

<Content>Best Stay in Boston ! Great Stay! Upgraded! Wow! First time I've ever been upgraded in any hotel ever. It was Thanksgiving and were not that busy but whatever. Went from a regular room to a small suite with two rooms and Ocean view. Kids liked watching the big ships go by. Two Tv's and no Sponge Bob for adults. Great stay, easy access to the rest of Boston. Don't listen to the people complaining about parking costs - it's Boston and it's like that everywhere. I've stayed in alot of hotels in Boston and this is one of the nicer ones. Thanks - Seaport !

<Content>They gouge you for parking Stayed over one night for a wedding. The accomodations were lovely, but I was shocked to discover that they charged us thirty-nine dollars for parking in the hotel's garage. I've stayed at many a hotel in many a large city and have never been charged close to that amount for parking in the hotel's garage Attempting to gouge its customers rates it two stars in my book.

<Content>Okay conference hotel The potential of Seaport Hotel is great, but unrealized. First, it is unlikely you will part anywhere near the correct place if you self-park -- very confusing. Front desk staff is friendly enough. Rooms were adequate and fairly new. Not much in the area within walking distance besides Convention Center and other hotels. Oddly designed in that the gym/pool are located on the same floor as the convention space. We didn't comfortable in our athletic/swim attire with a Marketing Sherpa show in front of us. Could have been worse, absolutely. But I guess we just expected more.

<Content>Very good for business travellers I have stayed there for a business summit, which was held in its World Trade Center. I can comment only the frontdesk of the hotel, catering of the trade center and the rooms, and I can say that everything was perfect. The staff is friendly and helpful, the food in the trade center was delicious, and the rooms are very comfortable and clean.The only unexpected and unpleasant thing for me were the additional taxes on the room's price, but I guess it was my fault for not checking all the additional costs, before my arrival.Location is OK, although it is a little bit aside from the downtown area, but if you are a business traveller, it shouldn't be an issue. There is a very convenient trolley-bus service, right next to the hotel, which can take you to the airport.I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Outstanding, clean, hotel w/ luxurious beds Pros:I love this hotel. It is new, fresh, clean and amazingly luxurious beds. I had a side view, but could see the bay. Great service.Cons:Not downtown, but the WorldTrade Center Train station is just across the street and a 10 minute ride to major sites. Parking is high, but I recommend using the T and getting a Charlie card for the week ($15).

<Content>Fine,but... Partner wanted to stay near Conference Center.Seaport has competition at various price points,Boston Harbour,Marriott Long Warf,InterContinental,Renaisance,Westin Waterfront. Plus the airport hotels are close enough , and you can use the water taxi.Seaport does nothing bad nor very good.Our 8 nights were rather dull.Endless event meetings going on.Its a no tipping hotel,but,18% service,5% tax,and 3$ room service charge later you wonder whats the point.Hated breakfast , coffee shop closes at 5.30 pm .Few shops or restaurants in the area.The gripe is in room noise.Thin walls , vacuum WC noise , and door slammers.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel was great... we booked a room through Priceline for only $180 a night. So for that price we received a great room with a view, king size bed and a decent size bathroom.The one downside with this hotel is the location, if you're looking to do touristy things I would stay in the heart of the city more. But it was a great hotel to stay in for one night.

<Content>Loved it A fantastic hotel. Rooms spacious and well-appointed. I'm beginning to think that a great hotel can be determined by whether or not a full (non-collapsible) umbrella is in each room. The Seaport of course provides this and much more. The free WiFi is appreciated. Only downside is location. I was there for a conference, so it was well situated for those purposes, but it does take 20 minutes to walk downtown (and I walk pretty quickly).I would stay here again, especially if for another conference at the Seaport WTC.

<Content>Good Hotel a little way outside the main downtown area We have just returned from a week in Boston where we stayed at the Seaport Hotel. Transfer from the airport could not have been easier. A bus just outside the main exit passes the hotel and we were actually in our room about 20 minutes after boarding. There is a 'T' station just by the hotel too on the Silver Line which provides a link between the airport and Boston's South Station. We found we could actually walk to the Boston Aquarium/Quincy Market area in about 20 minutes and to Boston Common in a few minutes longer.The hotel itself is about 10 years old and is well appointed. There is a pool/fitness centre and the room we had was very nice with a view of Boston Harbour and the airport on the other side. We didn't hear any noise.The breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant was well worth having. Set us up for the day. The hotel is all-inclusive and there is no need to tip any member of staff. In fact, there are notices asking that you don't. One of the waiters in the restaurant actually pointed out that we shouldn't tip him as service was included in the bill. In a few years time, I expect this hotel to be better placed for local attractions as the adjacent World Trade Center attracts more visitors. If you don't mind a short walk to the Downtown area or a trip on the 'T' (costing just $2 if you'd rather ride) then I think you will find this hotel a good bargain. We would stay there again.

<Content>Love, Love, Love Seaport Hotel I stayed at the Hotel the weekend of July 4th for a wedding. Seaport Hotel has beat all my expectations and I have stayed in hotels/resorts in Florida, NY/NJ, NC and California. Seaport definitely beat them all. The customer service was exceptional. The people that worked their greeted us warmly. They were available to us to help even when we didn't realize we needed help :) without being overbearing. The food at the restaurant downstairs was fabulous, we had a family breakfast buffet one morning and and some friends and I had breakfast the next morning. The food tasted great, was fresh and the price was excellent. The facilities was spotless. The view from our room was gorgeous. For the day of the wedding the wedding coordinator was available to us and so helpful and kind. They provided steamers and help with them when we needed. I was very impressed. This is the first review I've ever written for a hotel and I highly recommend this Hotel.

<Content>Nice - but, too pricey. It's a little pricey. Although, very comfortable and well run.My daily rate was $299 (it really feels like a $199 - $225 hotel). And, I had to extend one night and they upped the rate to $399. The one glitch was that there was a Bose clock radio in the room and it didn't work. The same thing happened for a business associate staying in another room.All-in-all - I'd stay there again, but not at that rate.

<Content>Don't stay at the Seaport Hotel - OVERRATED The overall visit and experience was terrible from the start. Valet parking wouldn't let us park had to find parking lot and then spoke to other people attending same event and half got to valet and half had to park themselves in a garage that is part of the hotel but you still are reguired to pay for even if your staying overnight at the hotel. Checking in was a nightmare. Waited 20 minutes to check in. Rooms air conditioner unit was not working. Staff was not helpful in giving us directions to function rooms and the food at the event (wedding) was Horrible.. I wrote letter to let the G.M. know about our stay and he wrote back that no one else has complained and he would investigate it. I don't care if no one else complained and I didn't ask for an investigation, I thought he would care to know about how is hotel looked to paying customers. No wonder the hotel was awful if that is how the G.M. is rude.

<Content>Seaport fun We stayed at the Seaport for four days. The hotel was beautiful and we were immediately upgraded to a suite. Our room had a flat screen and a computer - how great! The staff were friendly but not outgoing, you had to really approach them. The location was a bit far from other hotels, but within walking distance of the Children's Museum and the Aquarium. We took the water taxi and it was awesome. I don't know about the food there, we found the dining in the hotel to be overpriced and too upscale but there were several options within a block. We loved our stay at the hotel and had no problems. it was really fun. On checkin our kids were allowed to chose a toy from a treasure chest. They loved that! We would go again for sure.

<Content>Stay at Seaport I was at first very excited about my stay at the Seaport Hotel, hoping it would be excellent. My first problem was stained sheets. I told my husband they looked as if they had been laundered, but the BROWN stain made me have doubts. The plug in the tub did not work properly, so no bubble bath. The AC in the room did not work well. Although the temperature read as if it were ok, it was very hot and I had trouble sleeping. This discussion came up from another person that I met while at a seminar there. They said the same thing about their room and suggested that I turn the fan on to run all night. This did help. The next night, I ordered a bottle of wine through room service. The cost was to be $28 plus taxes and delivery fee. I was charged $45. I called room service to go over the problem and got no resolution. I had to take the bottle downstairs along with the price list that was in the room. I did get partial credit but not a full credit. WHY? Is it really that hard to calculate? Charge what you post and don't false advertise. I called twice before arriving to double check that the room charge would be put on the corporate card and was told both times, yes, it would. Didn't happen, I had to use my personal card and get reimbursed from my company. The only thing that I enjoyed about my stay was the food. The food was excellent and maybe the best breakfast I ever had in my life. I will say that I did request that maintenance fix the plug in the tub. They did, and I was able to take a bath my second night there.

<Content>Wonderful little hotel We were in Boston for a meeting and decided to try something different from the usual big chains (Marriott, Westin, etc.), and were very pleasantly surprised by the Seaport. Great service, very comfortable beds, quiet, easy access to the convention center by a walkway, and just down the block from a terrific restaurant called Salvatore's. The T is just outside the hotel, making travel into the city very easy. We really appreciated the in-room fridge; exercise room and pool were really nice but didn't allow kids16 (a real bummer since our daughter is an athlete and was counting on continuing her training during the vacation). Minor downsides: in-room coffee was awful, telephone receptionists were less than enthusiastic.

<Content>Exceptionally well run hotel ! First time in the hotel and it is a beauty. The hotel is an exceptionally well managed hotel where all employees go out of their way to make your stay nice. I stayed for 5 nights while on business and enjoyed every minute of it. Although it is off the beaten path a little downtown is an easy and pretty walk along the waterfront area. Don't make the mistake of relying on the close restaurants as many nicer restaurants are a short walk. The Legal Seafood place and old timer No Name Seafood are less than good so keep walking.

<Content>Very nice hotel, well priced Just stayed at the hotel for a conference and was very impressed. Nice rooms, good food throughout the conference and receptions, and a very nice health club. The club is actually a real fitness club with weights, cardio, an indoor pool, and locker room/steam room. It can get crowded in the morning when the non-guest members are there. The whole place was spotlessly clean, which is more than I can say for my club at home. The only slight drawback to the place is its location, as the hotel is located in a new development area so there are some unattractive parking lots around but over all it felt very safe. It is about a 20 min walk to Boston Common, but it is a pleasant walk in nice weather. Heading away from downtown toward the beach are some nice areas to jog.The staff were all gracious and friendly and the no tipping policy is nice. If the weather is good, and your not in a hurry, take the water taxi to/from Logan for a great view of the city. The drop off is right across the street from the hotel.

<Content>Great for conferences, airport accessibility I recently stayed here to attend a conference at the trade center next door. The main attraction of this hotel is that it is connected to the center via a sky bridge, it's also about 10 minutes from the airport by cab or water taxi. There are several nice restaurants within walking distance including the Legal Test Kitchen which we hit for drinks/appetizers one night.The hotel is your basic 4 star business hotel. The beds were comfy, there was a good selection of TV channels, and the staff was nice and helpful. The lack of an in-room mini-bar was surprising. Wireless Internet access was superb, though cost $10 a day through T-Mobile.On the downside, there is a lot of construction in the lobby as they conduct renovations to the main restaurant. The health club isn't just for hotel guests but rather is a public fitness center. It's small and crowded, but well equipped. When I went down at 7:00 AM to work out, every aerobic machine was in use. They also charge $2.00 for a bottle of water. The pool looked nice, and they have fitness classes and personal instructors available.I'd stay here again for an event at the hotel or the trade center, but not for any other reason.

<Content>Decent, nothing great My wife, 2 1/2 yr old daughter and I stayed at the Seaport the weekend prior to the Boston Marathon. The Hotel is is fair amount away from the main downtown area, and not really walking distance to very much. We knew that going in, as our plan was to go the Children's Museum and the Aquarium which were both relatively close. For our purposes, the hotel was in perfect location, but for someone looking for more of a touristy trip, I would advise against that location. The hotel itself was very nice looking, with a very friendly and helpful staff. The room was nothing more than average, and we had a great deal of trouble obtaining a comfortable room temperature. It was also quite pricey, but that may have been due to it being a busy weekend because of the marathon. I would only stay there again if we were doing the same trip to the museum and aquarium, but would still look into a less expensive alternative in the area. Also, be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for parking. We paid $29 for one night in the hotel garage, $24 for a couple hours at the Prudential Building lot, and a whopping $39 for 3 hours in the garage next to the Aquarium.

<Content>Didn't Want to Leave We stayed at this hotel for a weekend and did not want to leave! The hotel had all the little amenities that you could possibly want. The Seaport had a computer and free internet in the room. The computer was linked to the hotel in that you could request room service or valet parking from the computer. It had free local and long distance telephone calls. There was a doorbell outside your door and an electronic do not disturb and make up room button. The hotel had an extensive array of Gilchrist  Soames bath products, including bath salts, which you do not normally see in guest rooms. The room itself was very clean and even had a recycling wastebasket, which I thought was a great idea. The view of the seaport from our room was amazing. The staff was very friendly and does not accept tips at all, which is great. You can come and go as you please in valet parking and the staff was very nice, even when we lost our ticket. There were restaurants nearby and the location was great for sightseeing. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend.

<Content>NiceHotel I was in Boston to attend a conference. Seaport was only a short walk to the Boston Conference Center. The room was small but nice and clean. The staff was helpful but not really friendly. They weren't rude but not very enthuastic. The bellhops were the only ones who were friendly. The restaurant is expensive and I didn't care for the menu selections. But there are some restaurants that are within walking distance. The hotel is not located in an area where there are attractions. But you can catch a bus that will drop you off at Fanuil Hall. I also caught a tour bus that picks up in front of the hotel. The T is also across the street. The plumbing is quite loud but it didn't bother me. The wireless internet is a nice amenity. I enjoyed my stay and would visit this hotel again.

<Content>ok, I have stayed at better hotels I was there for a convention at the World Trade Center. Hotel was doing some renovations to the public areas. Front desk staff was not very knowledgeable about the hours of restaurant. When I made my reservation I asked it they had smoking rooms available, the reservationist said they did. Get there I am forced to intial the registration card stating the $150.00 fee for smoking. Had I been told the truth when I made my reservation I would have stayed at another hotel. Room was very small, not very clean. There was toothpaste spit on the mirror in the bathroom. The bedspread had an overwhelming smell of cheap perfume, asked for a clean one never got it. $29.00 per day for parking, you would think hotels guests would get a cheaper rate for parking. Behind the hotel is a lot for $11.00 per day. I do not think I will ever stay at thishotel again nor will I reccomend it to anyone. Bythe way this is a NO TIP facility, so no wonder the staff do not go out of thier way to help you.

<Content>wanted to stay there forever! My fiance and I went there for the wine expo, and found it a great place to stay. I immediately reccommended it to all my friends, even one coming in the summer to visit from Germany! We liked the small touches- the doorbell outside the room, the bathroom mirror that does not fog up, and the rug in the bathroom. Most hotels only give you a towel for the floor. The staff was courteous and informative at the desk, and even passing through the hallways. i loved the decor of the room, very up to date. the beds were actually quite comfortable, and we appreciated the small comfy chairs with side table to have our dinner in room. We actually walked the short distance to the 'no name restraunt' and brought it back to our room (the food was great), but we did order wine from room service, which was promptly delivered and enjoyed. it was a great stay and we were very happy. Wouldn't reccommend it though if you want to see a lot of boston sites just because it is not close to all the happenings, but it is very close to the T so you could get around.

<Content>Boston Wine Expo I stayed for two nights for the Wine Expo and this is the spot to stay for that event! We had views of the harbor anf the Pru my only complaint is that I don't care for innerspring matresses so I did not find the beds all that comfortable. But I am spoiled as I have a Natures rest latex core bed at home. Othwerwise the room was clean and comfortable. Room service was excellent and the staff simply awesome! I left my cord for my laptop there and I did not discover it until I got home. I was panicked as I needed to write a review of the Expo.I called the hotel who immediately retrieved it and mailed it back to me! No worries! Now that's service! Staff is wonderful. And there is no tipping. Really, they don't just say it. they mean it! They make you feel comfortable about it. So the cost of the hotel winds up being reasonable and a bargain for Boston. As for location the T is right there and you can get anywhere for about $10-12 for a cab. I went to the North end for dinner and to The Hungry I for less than ten dollars.

<Content>Good for Conference Stay This was our 2nd stay at the Seaport. Previously stayed there in 2006.Check in/out - Both the desk attendant for checking in and the one for checking out talked as quickly as possible, almost like a rehearsed speech (I live in the area, so I thought I talked fast, but WOW, they are speed demons). Both in and out, there wasn't anyone else waiting, so there was no need to rush. I wasn't asked if I needed anything checking in, nor was I asked how my stay was checking out. Very cold.Conceirge was great! Very friendly and chatty! Told us about some things in the area. Also told us that there is a free shuttle running every 10 minutes from the hotel to downtown Quincy Market! We used it and it was great. Very nice drivers.The hotel was under construction in the lobby, making the bar area tiny and very noisy. We didn't know about this until we checked in and saw it. No mention of this to us by the hotel desk clerk at check in. No compensation, such as a reduced drink at the reduced bar, or anything. Extension cords running through exterior doors, plastic hanging down in the lobby bar, smells, drills, saws and noise.Room was small but nice. Very clean. Only a few (maybe 8) channels on the tv!! As there is really nothing to do in the area at night, this was a surprise! Beds comfortable. As other reviewers mentioned, you could hear every toilet flush in the other rooms. As long as you wanted to be up at 6:30, when you can hear everyone's showers starting, and be awake about 10 PM to hear them all flushing their toilets as they go to bed, you'll be OK.Breakfast buffet was just OK. Very expensive. Ate a lunch and dinner at Morton's Steakhouse across the street. Also tried LTK down the street. Both were good alternatives for the restaurant in the hotel.Easy walk to the convention center. In fact we had a lovely view of the Convention center, the MBTA Silver Line station and its parking lot from our hotel room.Wireless internet worked fine.Parking is $29 a night. Beware that the hotel adds a $3 'service charge' to your nightly rate, and then Boston adds a hotel tax, a convention tax, a local tax, and maybe another one I've forgotten, to your bill, so your nightly rate will end up being more than the original quoted room rate.Overall, it wasn't as good as our stay 2 years ago (service seems colder and restaurant not as good). It is a good alternative to the Westin for Convention stays.

<Content>Great hotel with a nice interior, but in an off-beat location not close to much! I stayed here during the Xmas season to attend a Xmas party at the world trade center across the street and was impressed at how nice this place was. It is fairly new and has many floors and is modern place to stay. It is located in a off-beat location of Boston though, that is just starting to be developed. It was fine to stay here if you are attending a convention (right near the convention center) or doing something at the World Trade Center. But if you are here to visit and take in the sites and sounds of Boston, this isn't the place to stay. It is not close to anything and is not on any major public transportation lines. It is in a weird area of the city which someday will be very nice and connected, but isn't right now. The price may be right (this place is still a bit pricey), but take it from me, it is not a place to walk out your door and be in downtown. You will have to catch a cab (lacking area for cabs) and have them take you to the hot spots in the city. I give this place high ratings for its rooms which are filled with everything you need, its lounge/bar area which is trendy and intimate and its service, but I cannot give it high ratings on its location.

<Content>The Place to Stay for the Convention Center Better than average for a convention hotel. Convenient to convention center (not connected, but an easy walk) and very convenient parking. Hotel restaurant was typically overpriced, but there are other options within walking distance. Of the 2 hotel options for the convention center, this is the better choice.

<Content>Top Floors were gorgeous, but waaaaay too noisy We stayed there on a cold Saturday night and the hotel was warm and open and inviting and most importantly, very close to the T! The room was fine, the beds were great, the bathrooms beautifully stocked and we loved our views and all was fine. But the plumbing noise was horrific! All night, all day, all the time you could hear loud whooshes and rushes through some old (antique?) pipes. Eventually we asked for extra pillows and wrapped them around our heads, but as soon as they fell off we were back to rrrrroooorrror.....psheeeeewwwwww. It was impossible. We had planned to stay two nights, but upon final re-awakening (looking quite the worse for wear I might add) we all agreed that we couldn't take another night of this, and we moved to the Intercontinental which was cheaper, closer to the main parts of downtown, and had silent plumbing. I definitely can't recommend the Seaport AT ALL if all floors have the plumbing sound effects. Perhaps other floors don't have such an issue, in which case it is a perfectly nice place to stay.

<Content>Best hotel in Boston for the price We have stayed in every luxury hotel in Boston and this hotel really knocked our socks off. Prompt and friendly service and great food. Extremely clean rooms. The fitness center and lap pool were wonderful. We especially loved the casual atmosphere. Usually luxury hotels are stuffy. Not this one. Our only complaint was the location could be a little closer to Boston's attractions. However, for a fit couple like us, we enjoyed the walk to Fanuil and the other attractions. There are safe and interesting areas near the hotel to go for a run. Be prepared for the expensive parking and steep hotel taxes in Boston.

<Content>Don't bother reserving a a double or a king because you get a room only!! When I made the reservation for a nice weekend in Boston the nice lady on the phone asked me if I would like a king bed or two doubles in the room. I wanted two doubles and she ok'd me on that. When I arrived at the hotel to check in they told me that my room had a king bed, and I told them that I needed two doubles and that's what I had reserved. The lady replied that my reservation on secures me a room and not a certain type of room. Then why asked me on the phone which I would like to stay in? They gave me another room and when I got my things up to the room it was a king size bed and nothing else. I then had to call the front desk and ask what was going on. They said it was a mistake and someone would be up to give me new rooms keys. After switching rooms I was finally in the correct room for my stay. The whole thing took over an hour and I missed my dinner reservations for the night thanks to the Seaport. So if your just looking for a room to stay in then go the Seaport.

<Content>nice place, but not like the website the website lead us to believe that there are harbor views and a pool with music piped in underwater, neither of which were true, not exactly, I could see water from the window when straining to see out sideways. Good location, close to everything, staff courteous, clean and comfortable.They were under construction and failed to tell us this when booking, so not everything was in tgood shape.

<Content>what a view My husband and I stayed at the Seaport the last weekend in Dec.Luckily, it was a warm, sunny weekend so we were able to fully enjoy the location. Upon checking in and having no view we requested an upgrade and were given a corner room that had great views. The hotel was an easy walk to Fan Hall area, has several restaurants near by and a nice coffee shop on the property. We did take out for a late afternoon snack and sat in front of our windows ejoying the view while dining in the room. Staff was very couteous. If you stay here slpuge for a room with a water view, it is worth it.

<Content>Beware "The Boardroom" I stayed at the Seaport Hotel for a conference and, upon checking in, was given room #1616. When I got on the elevator I noticed that the 16th floor button also had a designation as The Boardroom.Well, room #1616 is right next to The Boardroom which is nothing more than a meeting room. While my biggest concern was that #1616 was very close to the elevator and right across the hall from the ice service, it was the meeting room that gave me the biggest headache.There is a small service area used by the hotel staff to service the meeting room and service it they do. From the 10 PM vacuuming of The Boardroom, to the hotel folks in there even later with those wonderful two way cellular phones that signal beep-beep each time someone pages them. Of course they are back at work before 6 AM to prep the room for the day's use (When a group rents this room for their meeting they really get their monies worth!).The hotel was fully booked, so a replacement room was not an option.To put it short, the granite counters in the bathroom, high end toiletries, high quality bedding and Bose radio could not overcome the banging, dropped dish, vacuuming and other full-time noise coming from the service room next door.If you choose to stay at this hotel be careful not to be above, below, or on either side of 鈥淭he Boardroom鈥?

<Content>Excellent for my WTC Conference The hotel location was excellent for my meeting in the CityView Ballroom in the WTC across the street. But transportation is very easy to this hotel with the MBTA Silverline WTC stop being right across the street and only a couple stops from the airport. The room was not lavish but was clean and well appointed with free wireless (something many Boston hotels nickel and dime you for). I also had dinner in the restaurant and was very pleased with the Tuna and Langostine dinner I had. The price is better than most I found on Orbitz and the location was perfect for me but I honestly will stay there again because of the ease to the SilverLine through the hotels Plaza level.I hope this helps you.

<Content>Very big and "corporate" but excellent service I didn't like the general atmosphere much at this hotel but everything else about it was fine. Toilet flushing is extremely loud almost as bad as that on a plane so you can hear other toilets flushing in other rooms too. The room was fine but a fairly plain and boring for my taste. We only stayed one night before flying out the following morning and the location is great for going to the airport the next day. We ate dinner there and the food and service was excellent! I would stay here again if I wanted to be close to the airport.

<Content>A wonderful place Me and my 3 children went to Halloweentown at World Trade Center and stayed over night at the hotel. Its a beautiful hotel and the people are very helpful. The kids and I enjoyed the indoor pool alot, it was very nice and relaxing. The room was good size and the beds were extremely comfortable, we hated to come home and sleep in our own. And the view was great too..It was a very easy trip from South Station and about a $7 taxi ride to Fanuial Hall.

<Content>A good stay No complaints. Good size room, clean and functional. The hotel is at the Trade Center, so there's a walk or cab to the city center, but if you are attending a convention it is very convenient. All inclusive policy, so no need to tip, hopefully the staff are adequately compensated. There's one issue if you are a light sleeper, the plumbing is very noisy. I thought it was just my room, but this was noted by more than one person staying.

<Content>Very pleased! Although the hotel is not in the center of things it is directly across the street from the T on the Silver Line and we had no trouble navigating around (plus it's the first stop out of Logan). The room was spotless, beds were great and our late night dinner in the bar was reasonable, plentiful and delicious. We stayed just one night so didn't try the main resturant but the menu was impressive. We didn't drag laptop on vacation but hotel has three free computers in the lobby and we had access to the 24 hour business center computers and printers to print out our boarding passes. Concierge was helpful with suggestions and directions for our one day whirlwind sightseeing in Boston. They offered a late check out but we were content with bellman holding our bags all day on our departure day. It's expensive but every decent hotel in Boston is and this was cheaper than the more recognizable names.

<Content>great hotel --location ????? This is an a outstanding hotel. Everything is Deluxe quality. We were here for a wedding- the catering and set up was wonderful. But this is not a place for tourists - it is not near any Boston sights- given the problem in driving around Boston and the parking fees -you have to take a taxi - note the parking fee at the hotel is $29 or $37 for valet per nite. We took a look at the Marriott and that looks seedy.

Not only did I get an early check-in, but I did not have to ask for it.The Room is 4-5 star quality, bed is of top notch comfort and the high end breakfast at the Auro Rest. is a must visit, expensive but the food is all-star - not the usual breakfast buffett!High recommend this hotel, everything about it is great!!

<Content>Good oasis. We are Bostonians who sadly have to work elsehwhere . We found this to be a well situated hotel in an interesting area of the city. Thanks to the ease of its shuttle other central areas of Boston proper are easily accessible. The hotel was pleasing, very clean, excellent rooms. The breakfasts are a bit pricey but there are other eating establishments withing walking distancea and are worth seeking out . No complaints and we would come here again. Beautiful spot inthe summer and most likely interesting in the Winter season. Go without fear but bring your own hardboiled eggs.

<Content>Loved the location and view.... As a speaker with a meeting/event academy and exhibition, the planner who books sites and accommodations had sited and selected this property for the speakers hotel stays. While there were industry posts regarding the noise level in the hotel, I was on the 16th floor facing the south and waterfront overlooking Boston Harbor and the Seaport Trade Center and some of the docks. The view from the room was beautiful, well appointed and had many surprise amenities such as single pod coffee makers that could brew Euro-style coffee or a traditional 8 oz. serving. There was even a scale in the bathroom!The room was beautifully appointed with soothing decor, a very comfortable bed, complimentary wireless internet (and ethernet cords for wired laptops) along with television and a lovely Bose Wave Radio. Walking in upon check-in, the radio was playing and when they came in for turn-down service....it was turned on again.I loved the bathroom with the curved shower rod, meaning I didn't have to fight the clinging curtain from the traditional rod configuration. The Green Concept was also something that gave a good feeling over stewardship from water consumption, use of towels/linens and each room was also equipped with recycling bins with splits in the waste basket. They're also a LEEDS hotel so they're most energy efficient.While there have been posts about the noise level in this hotel, I didn't experience any interference from rooms adjacent, or noise from the hallway.Hotel staff was also very accommodating, friendly and guest centric with their attentiveness. I didn't dine at the hotel or avail room service...but I did note the lobby bar was very busy and quite animated with patrons. I learned that during the summer, there are concerts just a couple blocks away that not only draw crowds before and after, but many times, the hotel is utilized by talent and road crews on production.The convenient location to the airport was a swift 15 minute ride to and from the Boston Logan Airport. Cabs are also plentiful and can pickup from the street level, or from the 3rd level that spills out on the walkways for both the convention and trade centers.We took a day trip on arrival to the JFK Library, only a 20-25 minute cab ride and then walked two blocks to a wonderful seafood restaurant that was FABULOUS, recommended to our group of meeting planning professionals that was right on.I have very acute hearing....so it was a pleasant and wonderful night's rest...and you gotta love the lamps in the bedrooms that have dimmers on them.....and the night light in the bathroom was also a bonus!

<Content>Great Value I stayed here for 5 days as part of a convention group. This is a new, modern hotel which was clean, had great views of Boston Harbor, and spacious comfortable rooms. The front desk and concierge were always helpful and available. The lobby coffee bar had reasonably priced tasty offerings for a quick lunch or breakfast. The wireless internet connection in the room ran at blazing speed. The location is perfect for those who want to walk to the convention center, but there is very little going on around the hotel on the weekends. However, the hotel is literally next door to the MBTA station making visits to all of the sights very convenient (it's on the silver line, and the South Street transportation hub is just 2 stops away), and it is just two MBTA stops away from the airport, making it very convenient for air travelers. Because it is amid office buildings, in the evenings the hotel surroundings are very quiet.

Hotel has a no tipping policy which is nice.

Easy access to and from Logan either by cab $25 or subway $5.

<Content>The Worst! 1. Stayed 4 nights for a conference earlier this month. I initially booked the room directly via phone over 2months prior to the conference and was told I would recieve the conference price. I recieved a confirmation from the hotel verifying this, and when I checked in I was told the price of the room was  $100.00 more for each night. Upon questioning this, I was told that there were a limited number of rooms reserved at that price, they didn't know what happened, but that, oh well, sorry, no more rooms at the discounted price available. Having never been to Boston and not know the area at all, I felt stuck, so I stayed. 2. The rooms was small and very, very noisy. The walls are paper thin and you can hear a lot of noise, especially from the bathrooms. 3. The last night of our stay, there was some sort of Fire in the hotel and the alarm system came on, annouced the situation, and instructed us to wait for further instructions. The message kept playing, but we recieved no instructions. I kept looking out our 10th floor window at the fire trucks below and the growing number of people gathering on the sidewalk. Upon trying to get information from the front desk, I was told that no one could talk to me about the situation. VERY UN-NERVING. After 20min of getting no where, we left the room and walked down 10 flights of stairs, met other guests who reported the same sense of uneasiness, not being able to get any information. When we reached the Lobby, my husband was again told that no one could talk to him. There seemed to be a lot of confusion. We sat on the sidewalk for over an hour before we were finally let back in, and were never told anything about the incident. When we checked out the next am, the desk clerk asked how our stay was, I mentioned the fire incident the night before and she just laughed, shrugged it off and said oh, yeah, that. NO apologies for sitting outside for an hour at 1030 at night, nothing. I couldn't believe it. Will never stay there again, nor would I refer anyone to stay there. The staff and facility highly over-rate themselves.

<Content>very nice hotel My husband and I stayed here for a wedding that was held at the hotel. We decided to come up a day early. The hotel staff was very pleasant and the no tips aspect was very nice. It is on the expensive side but we are talking downtown Boston. Compared to similar hotels, the price was about average. To see the sights it only takes 5 minutes to walk to the Institute of contempary arts, 15-20 minutes to Quincy Market, Rowes Wharf, 20-25 to the Aquarium. The T (subway) is across the street and very easy to go anywhere in the city.The room was very neat and though I agree that you can hear the neighbors shower and toilet, I did not find that to be all that disturbing but maybe it was because we had quiet neighbors. I found the bed to be very comfortable. The housekeeping staff was also very pleasant. The fitness center and pool areas are complimentary with the room and are of very nice quality. The gym staff were also very professional and helpful.The hotel had several wedding receptions going on at the same time but they did not intefere with ours. The reception we attended was in the Lighthouse hall. This is the newer room and had wonderful views. The only problem was that to go to the bathroom you needed to go down a steep outside staircase or take a small elevator. The food and service was very good at the reception.Overall, we enjoyed our stay. We went to school in Boston and enjoy coming to visit. We would stay here again for a special occasion but for general travel it is a bit expensive.

<Content>Overall, a pleasant experience. My wife, son and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We had a room with 2 double beds - it was a little tight but by no means cramped. The room clean and all the furniture, mattresses, etc. were fairly new and comfortable. The bathroom as well was clean and everything worked properly. There was a table and chairs, a writing desk and adequate closet space and drawers. The mini bar was well stocked and there was a coffee machine in the bathroom (the coffee was pretty good too). An iron, ironing board and hair dryer are provided and there is a laundry service if you need it. High speed wireless internet service is complementary in every room. The business center has computers, printers and a business quality copy machine. The fitness center is well equipped.As other reviewers have stated, the staff was very gracious and accommodating. This is a service hotel and there is no tipping required, in fact, it's discouraged. (However, when we had a drink at the bar, they added a 15% gratuity to the check.) During the day, our floor was very noisy, there seemed to be a lot of activity coming from the housekeeping station so if you're the type who likes to take a mid-day nap, it could be a distraction. At night however, it was very quiet.One thing that we found disappointing was that there was no complementary breakfast - it may sound petty but I expected more from a $150 - $200 per night hotel. There is a restaurant on the premises and you can have breakfast there if you choose. There is also a small cafe where you can get coffee, pastries, cereal, etc.The hotel is not exactly near the center of town but you can walk there if you like walking. There is also a subway nearby (we found the subways very easy to navigate) and complementary shuttle service into town. (Every 15 minutes Mon - Fri 7am - 7pm via coach - on the weekends they provide a van but less frequently and only until 1:30pm.) There were always taxis parked outside as well. If you drive there and choose to park in the hotel's garage, you should know that at the time of this writing, the fee is $29 extra per night - we found this excessive and do not believe guests should be charged.Overall the experience was pleasant - the only reason that we would not choose to stay here again is due to the hotel's proximity to the center of town. If you are staying in Boston for more than a couple of days, getting into town can become a hassle but if you like being near the water we have no problem recommending this hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Staff But Thin Walls and Physical Problems The staff at this hotel is outstanding -- both friendly and helpful. That includes the front desk, room service, and the wait staff. The room was immaculately clean, and the bed and bedding were very comfortable. This property has two detractions. First, the walls are thin. I could hear the TV in one adjacent room, the radio in the other adjacent room, and virtually whispered conversations in the hallway. In the morning, I could hear the fellow next door blow his nose and using the phone. Second, the physical condition of the property could benefit from attention. The wood edges of the furniture are wearing. One of the dresser drawers did not work. The curved shower curtain rod was hanging down from the wall, so that the curtain wanted to hang at the middle of the rod and not stay pulled to the ends. The sitting chairs are uncomfortable. I doubt that I would stay here again, but on the other hand I would not caution someone not to stay here.

<Content>Nice Hotel This hotel is very nice. I am not sure what people are all upset about on this site. You are unable to actually hear people going to the bathroom as one person stated. You can hear the pipes when someone flushes the toilet. There is a HUGE difference. This is not typical but I have heard it at other hotels as well. This hotel does have thin walls, but it was not horrible. The gym here is amazing. I would stay here again for the gym... fitness is very important to my daily routine. Its free and its amazing. The desk in the room is perfect for someone on business... the internet services is free and fast! This hotel is great... the room is starting to show some signs of age, but it is still great. I would suggest checking out LTK for dinner... its a block away and the food was great.

<Content>Wonderful experience I have visited Seaport Hotel on many occaisions for business lunches and meetings, and have always been impressed with the service and attentiveness of the staff. When I had to spend an overnight in Boston, I did not hesitate to make my reservation at Seaport. I was pleased, but not surprised, to discover that the impeccable service I had grown so fond of at the bar and the restaurant extended to the entire hotel. From the doorman to the concierge to the staff at the fitness center, everyone was genuine and courteous. And the gracious woman at the giftshop was nothing but pleasant after I unknowingly had her stay open an extra 10 minutes as I purchased a few items that I had forgotten. The fitness center was one of the nicest I have ever experienced and was a far cry from the 3-treadmill, outdated fitness centers I have seen at other hotels. And the locker room was just as impressive. I did not get to experience a spa-treatment, but it is certainly on my to-do list. Another thing that shouldn't go unnoticed is the hotel's committment to being environmentally conscious. This includes encouraging guests to recycle and providing them with the means to do so as well as giving the option to reuse towels and linens- which is a conservation measure that really adds up. The subject of the environment is important to me, and I was thrilled when I saw the hotel's dedication to the environment. Lasty the guests rooms were cozy and vibrant, and the views of the waterfront and the city could not be beat!All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Seaport, and recommend it to anyone who is planning on staying in Boston. And if you live in Boston, I suggest that you at least experience the hotel restaurant and bar or treat yourself to a facial!

<Content>VERY disappointed WOW what a disappointment. We stayed here a couple of weeks ago. After returning home, I thought about the poor service we had received and emailed the hotel about it. I was immediately sent back a generic email acknowledging their receipt of my email, and told I would receive a response within 24 hours. 4 days later when I still hadn鈥檛 heard back, I called the hotel. I was assured by a very nice man at the front desk that my concerns would be addressed. He confirmed my contact information. Now 12 days later I STILL haven鈥檛 received the courtesy of a response and apparently never will. WOW, still can鈥檛 believe this. For a new upper class hotel to act with this extraordinary lack of professionalism is a total mind blower. They do not give a rat鈥檚 butt about my experience, and don鈥檛 mind that I know this- the message cannot be clearer. (And if I now receive a response to this review from the hotel, I'll be even madder that this is what it took for them to take notice.) We stayed here on a Friday night. This is an 18 story hotel which is very nicely appointed. It has what I'm sure is a very nice restaurant (though too expensive for us), a nice bar with couches  comfy chairs, a top notch very large full service gym, and an indoor heated pool. What could be the problem, you say? 1) The no tipping policy sounds good when you check in. We discovered soon however, why it isn鈥檛. Absolutely everything you buy and do and eat has an automatic 18% charge tacked onto it. Friday night we went to the hotel's bar. We ordered a margarita, and a gin  tonic, and were served quickly. We asked for a menu and while going over same, I began to realize that my drink was not a gin  tonic but a RUM  tonic- absolutely no question about it. Still, not wanting to make a fuss, I said nothing at first. Meanwhile, I noticed that everyone around us had been served with the standard bowl of peanuts that bars serve, except us, but I thought, no matter, our order will be taken and we'll be eating soon. (We were pretty hungry.) We decided on items from the menu, and put ours down on the counter and waited. The bartender, the same one who had given us our menus, walked over and left our check, then walked away without a word. We sat there, confused. No one approached us to take our order or at least offer us the peanut bowl. Meanwhile I had my rum and tonic in front of me. I flagged down another bartender and told her about the mistake with my drink and that I didn鈥檛 want it, and asked her to remove it from the bill. She apologized and did so, and when I looked at the new bill, it contained not only the $10 charge for my companion's drink (yes $10 for a margarita), but also the hotel's 18% service charge. So for unacceptably poor service, for which I wouldn't have left a tip, the staff still got their full tip. Again 鈥?I emailed the hotel with this story, and they never responded. Maybe this particular incident wasn鈥檛 a huge deal, but by first telling me I would hear back in 24 hours and then not responding to even my follow up request for a response, it became a big deal to us. What this hotel does not understand is that the whole IDEA behind tipping is that it hopefully encourages good service. If you received good service, you tip, if you didn't, you don't, yet this place forces you to, regardless. 2) Location- I can鈥檛 stress this enough to those who are unfamiliar with Boston: this hotel is in a VERY odd, largely empty area of Boston down by the fish piers. Trust me, there ain't much going on here, folks. Also, the area is positively brimming with parking lots, yet they still charges you $28 dollars a day for parking yourself in their garage! You are at least 7 very large virtually empty city blocks away from anything a tourist or even business traveler would want to visit or see, such as Faneuil Hall or the Freedom Trail or downtown, etc. You are near some seafood restaurants, the Institute of Contemporary Art, and Dunkin Donuts across the road. That's it.Granted, the newish T line, the Silver line, is across the street, so you can hop on the train/bus to get into town, but otherwise this is a dead, empty area of the city. 3) Our room was quite small - literally smaller than rooms I've stayed in at the Motel 6. Nice bathroom, nice fluffy feather pillows, nice down comforter. But the tv wasn鈥檛 what one would expect in a hotel of this class 鈥?for example you literally had to walk up to turn it off and on (the remote only worked to change channels). Perhaps a small thing, but things add up at this place. 4) Noise: While there is virtually no noise from outside the hotel, we were treated several times to the sounds of our neighbors urinating, which was clear as a bell for some reason, and mind you, not something we heard from inside our bathroom which would have been understandable, but from the main room. I have no idea why this is, other than paper thin walls, apparently. Also, the toilet flush is extremely strong. Not a bad thing I guess, but what that means is, each and every time any of your neighbors (above below or next to you) flush, you hear it, all night.5) Overly pricey hotel restaurant. For example, $14 waffles. To be fair, we didn鈥檛 eat there so I can鈥檛 vouch for whether it might be worth the price. 6) And finally, the pool is a quite small for a hotel of this size and both times we attempted to use it, it was full with literally a dozen kids splashing around, tossing balls around  running all over the place. It was like being at a daycare center. There was no physical room to swim, so were unable to. A surprising finding for what is supposed to be a business hotel. We looked forward to staying here, but were disappointed on so many levels, particularly the hotel's refusal to even attempt to address or respond to our complaint, that we certainly never will again.

<Content>Good Hotel But Thin Walls/Floors I stayed at the Seaport Hotel/Boston over President's Day weekend. The hotel, while nicely appointed and comfortable, featured walls that weren't as insulated as I think they should be. I was sitting at the desk working on my laptop and was interrupted shall we say by the very clear sound of someone using the facilities either upstairs or next door. I heard everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING coming from the bathroom. The Seaport should have put more money into constructing the rooms with soundproofing, not only for the outside walls, but additionally for the inside ones as well. While I would recommend this hotel for a business traveler or tourists, they should be cautioned as to the noise that may eminate from the next room.

<Content>Home away from home I've stayed at the Seaport several times over the last few years. I travel to Boston frequently, and the Seaport is one of the few hotels I've chosen to stay at more than once. While the hotel is a bit farther removed from the heart of the city, it's by no means out of the way, and the level of service more than makes up for a few extra blocks walking. The staff is extremely helpful and dedicated to making guests feel not just welcomed, but special. Especially notable given the all-inclusive, no tipping policy at the hotel. There's also appears to be a very low staff turnover rate, and it's been great to be welcomed by the same friendly faces each trip. It feels more like visiting an old friend than staying in a hotel.

<Content>Great hotel but a few disappointments I am so disappointed to have to write this review. I love this hotel and its service inclusive policy and so much of what it tries to achieve. Unfortunately on my last trip here a number of things left a bad taste in the mouth.Good points first of all- no tipping - the best hotel gym I have ever been in (and I have seen a lot)- free internet in the room- great food in the bar and friendly bar staff- good enviromental policyBad points- our 4am alarm clock did not materialise meaning that we were almost late for our flight.- the taxi they called was 'jumped' by another taxi who then tried to con us by not turning on the meter. The bellhop placed our luggage in the 'wrong' taxi and we felt forced to go with the wrong one - he didn't seem to care that this taxi had appeared from nowhere. - there are no breakfast items on the in-room menu before 6am I suppose the big question is would I stay here again? The answer is an unequivocal 'yes' but I don't think of the hotel as fondly as I once did.

<Content>Excellent, comfortable, service-oriented hotel My husband and I have stayed at the Seaport twice in the last 6 months. Service is excellent (right from when your cab pulls up to the hotel), the rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean (and some have awesome views of the harbor) and the atmosphere is one that makes you feel right at home. All the service people were friendly, efficient and responsive. The hotel's no-tipping policy is a very nice touch -- more hotels should do this! The restaurant and bar have good food and are convenient. The quick walk , adjacent subway stop or free shuttle to downtown make it a nice base from which to see Boston. It is a little removed from the busy, noisy downtown, which for us is a positive. There are some great restaurants in walking distance and you can catch a ferry to Provincetown across the street. We fell in love with Boston and the hotel was part of the reason why.

<Content>Much better than the Westin There are few options of nearby places to stay if you are attending a converence at the new Boston convention center. Although I did not stay at this hotel, I had friends staying at this hotel and spent a lot of time there while attending a conference this past week. If you are attending a conference at the new Boston convention center, would highly recommend staying here over the neighboring Westin hotel. It is just a short walk across an overpass to the convention center and much nicer and cheaper than the Westin. Service, food quality and options and the business services offered are much better than the Westin. Here are some specifics. While the Westin hotel charges their guests 20 cents a page to photocopy, the Seaport charges 10 cents. It cost $10 to print out a 6 page Word document at the Westin--at the Seaport, access to computers and printers was free for hotel guests in the business center. Also, a computer is set up in the lobby for free guest use (Westin charges 9.95 per day for wireless access in the rooms). Unlike the Westin hotel, guests were notified when overnight packages arrrived (at the Westin they charge for the privilege of picking up the packages and don't even let you know that they arrived). Although very large, the Westin hotel does not have sufficient capacity to serve food to its guests. Only one restaurant plus a Starbucks in the lobby at the Westin--at the Seaport there is a bar/lounge, restaurant and Starbucks. One night, I was told there was a 1.5 hour wait for Westin room service. When called back 1.5 hour later, was again told it would be 1.5 hours. When shared this story with a friend at the Seaport--she said that the wait was always a half hour or less for room service. Other Westin guests also complained about the food. One day, guests waited over half an hour to access the Westin lunch buffet even though there were empty tables (not have enough staff). In comparison to the Westin, service was warmer at the Seaport. To say thank you to the Seaport for their kind service while attending the conference, I ate as many of the meals that I could there. Food was also better at the Seaport (e.g., turkey sandwich at the Seaport was carved turkey instead of pressed turkey at the Westin). Cleaning could be better at the Westin although only about 6 months old--big stain on the carpet, a previous guest's old food was still in the minibar, and used glasses were put back where the clean ones should have been. To be fair, I did speak to the Westin manager about these problems before I left and she did offer $100 off my very expensive week stay. However, if I was returning to Boston for a conference, would book the Seaport.

<Content>very nice I stayed here for 5 nights for a conference. The room was verynewly done and comfortable. The staff was very helpful (whenI returned once as my room was being cleaned, the maid gladlypacked up and left, to come back when it was convenient for me).A nice touch is that the hotel is service inclusive and the staffseemed eager to please. The hotel has free wi-fi and is convenient to public transportation.The only drawback was that the air conditioning in the public areas was set very cold, but this may have been a side-effect of handling the extremely hot weather outside at the time.Overall, it was a very pleasant stay.

<Content>Remarkable Service The Seaport is in an excellent location for those attending conventions a/o meetings at the new convention center; it is a good location for many other other purposes, and, just a short walk away, it is the closest hotel to the Bank of America Pavillion, a performance venue. Parking, both self- and valet- are convenient, and rates, while not cheap, (this is Boston,) include in-and-out privileges. The Seaport has a highly-rated upscale restaurant, the Aura, and an early-morning to late afternoon Bakery Cafe snack bar, as well as 24 hour room service. Contrary to other reviews on this site, the Seaport is a short walk from eateries of various price, cuisine and formality levels, including the Barking Crab, Daily Catch, Anthony's Pier 4, Seaport Bar and Grill, Yankee Lobster Company, the brand-new, ultra-modern LTK, (Legal Test Kitchen, of the Legal Fish Company empire,) the No-Name restaurant, a Chinese restaurant and the breakfast/lunch cafeteria of the Boston World Trade Center (weekdays only). A new Panini restaurant is about to open a block away. The just-opened (June, 2006,) Westin Convention Center hotel, with its facilities, is a short walk away, so the Seaport is not an isolated hotel.We occupied an attractive one-bedroom corner suite, #1001, with a partial harbor view, while attending a convention at the neighboring convention center. It was not large for a suite, but we were impressed by the attractive, and thoughtful layout and details which made it extremely practical AND comfortable, (which is a pleasure compared to so many boutique hotels which sacrifice practicality and comfort for stylishness). On request, the Seaport will empty your minibar so that you may use it for your own (refrigerated) storage.Rooms include many mod cons (e.g. a Bose Wave radio/CD player as the clock radio and a laptop-size complimentary electronic safe) and good communications options, including complimentary wired and wireless broadband, public spaces wireless-equipped, and public computers in the lobby. Thoughtful touches include free loaner LAN cables on the desk in the room. The hotel has a business center; if guests need, as I did, to print out documents, the PrintMe system allows printing from your room to a high-quality color printer in the Business Center, another complimentary service. (The center is open, by guest room-keys, 24 hours a day, and is staffed during the day.)Outstanding service, though, was the high point of our five-day stay. We were pleasantly surprised, in a completely non-tipping environment, at how eager, without being obsequious, every staff member we encountered seemed to be to serve us.Rooms are not cheap, as few are in Boston, but are comprable to other similarly situated hotels which may get you with add-ons like daily broadband access fees, and no free auto in-and-out.We thought the Seaport served our needs oustandingly.

<Content>Nice hotel! My fiance and I stayed here while looking at various venues for our wedding. We read some unpleasant rewiews so we were skeptical and wanted to see for ourselves instead of experimenting on our guests. Granted, they knew why we were staying here and perhaps tried a little harder than usual, but we a very nice overnight stay here. I checked in with no problem, had a great room with a king bed and awesome view of the harbor and Logan. The bathroom was spacious and clean. I even had Chinese food leftovers from earlier that evening which Room Service reheated for me. My fiance had some wireless internet issues which he eventually figured out, but initially we called the front desk who said they would send someone up, but noone ever came. Overall, it was a great hotel and have no problem with my guests staying here.

<Content>hope to return My husband and i live locally and we try to make it into the Seaport once a year. We generally combine a concert at the Boston Pavillion and a nights stay. This year we celebrated our daughters twentyfirst birthday at the Chart house and stayed in town to celebrate our anniversary as well. We were not dissapointed. We arrived before check in but due to the convention in town we were unable to check in early. Okay, we understood that. We requested a  harbor view and were told they  would try We walked around a bit and returned promptly at 3:00. Pleasantly they were able to accomodate our request. We got a corner room on the 8th floor,with a spectacular view of Logan, the water, and several Navy ships that were in town for the 4th of July. The room was immaculate, the bed ( king sized) very comfortable and spacious and the room was quiet. We had dinner with our kids, and departed for a night cap in the lounge, again, very comfortable.the Seaport is not in the heart of town, but as one reviewer noted, its an easy walk, especially along the waterfront on a summers night..... after a long New England winter, nothing like it. The next day we walked to Fanueil Hall and the Aquarium, like a couple of tourists. Its quiet because of its proximity and we enjoyed that. The waterfront will be going through some development so eventually there will be more shops around. If thats what you are looking for, but for us its great as is.

<Content>Okay, but nothing great Stayed two nights at the Seaport while in Boston on a business trip. The hotel is fine, but certainly not what it seems to think it is. The room was clean, a little above average in size, but had decor that seems outdated and nowhere very comfortable to sit. They advertise free wireless connections throughout the hotel, but this seems more of a myth than a reality. When I simply could not get connected and called the front desk they told me to get a cord out of the minibar (so, yes, you pay for it), as most guests have the same problem and just find it easier to connect with the cord. One high point is that the Water Taxi from the airport does drop you off immediately across the street, and it is much quicker, more scenic and certainly less expensive ($17 round trip) than a standard taxi. The Seaport is okay, but don't be too excited.

<Content>Perfect for conventions...and those that like walking I stayed at the Seaport for 6 nights during a conference at the convention center. I was a little disappointed that I wasn't assigned my preferred hotel/location of the Westin Copley. However, upon arrival everyone was very courteous and the room was fine. I thought the room was quite big compared to others I've stayed at in Boston. I travel for work 60% of my time and I'd say the room was average. In the end I am quite pleased with my stay here.  * The hotel is 'service inclusive', meaning no one accepts tips. This may be why the price is a littler higher. No tipping the bellman, doorman, taxi whistle guy, housekeeping...etc. It did make things nice.* Wireless internet is throughout the hotel and is offered free...again, maybe you pay for that in your room price. This is extremely convenient though for a work trip. * I had meetings everyday at either the convention center or world trade center and the convenience of the hotel being next door is great. It's maybe a 5 minute walk to either one, and being able to go back to my room without having to wait in line for a taxi or shuttle at the end of the day was very nice.* Fitness center is great and no extra charge. There are personal TVs on each treadmill/elliptical/bike and you just plug in your headphones and select your channel. If you forget headphones you can buy them there. There was never anyone in there when I went either. I didn't see the pool...* Well, although I liked the location, it was for the convenience to the convention center and WTC. Like another post mentioned it really isn't near any of the restaurants/bars that make Boston such a fun city. However, Boston is a fairly small and compact city and very walker friendly. I walked to the North End one night and it took 30 minutes. It's a very nice walk along the water and wharfs, cut through Columbus Park onto Richmond and you'll hit Hanover street which is the heart of the North End (boston's Little Italy). Go to Antico Forno at 93 Salem for brick oven baked Gnocchi...delicious. And after that, hit Mike's Pastry for some of the best cannolis and pistachio macaroons (you can see why I hit the fitness center so much).I also walked to the Back Bay in about 40 minutes, again a great walk and you can cut through Boston Commons and the Public Garden. So the location is not great to get somewhere in a hurry, but there are plenty of cabs that will get you just about anywhere in a max of 15 minutes. Plus the T is very efficient and frequent. If you're coming for business, especially at the convention center/WTC it's a great place. If you're coming for a vacation, I would probably stay somewhere else, just to really experience the city.

<Content>Would not stay again. I have stayed at the Seaport in the past for business and events at the hotel.Never memorable, but not bad.My most recent stay was most disappointing.I was attending an event and the group arranged for my room, but not under my name so the hotel did not realize I was a repeat customer.The room was decent. Supposedly they did major renovations, but all they did was a doorbell and changed the bedsheets. hardly a renovation.We came back from the event and no turn down had occured. They always did turn down before including bottled water. I called the operator and was informed they do not do turn down for everyone and they stopped bringing water to the rooms a few months ago. When I told him that they always do turn down for me he told me that they do turn down for repeat customers. As it was almost 11pm, he said well there's really nothing I can do now, so what do you want?If they are really a 4 Star hotel, turn down is expected and should be the norm.I would go out of my way to stay elsewhere.

<Content>Wonderful! My husband and I stayed here for a night, while attending a convention.We live about an hour outside of Boston, but never drive in the city, so we didn't know how hard it would be to find the hotel. We used the directions on the hotel web site and it was easy to find the street, but the hotel itself isn't that well marked...lots of banners saying Seaport something-or-other but no real indication of where the hotel is - we ended up parking in their lot across the street and dragging our suitcases over. If you can find it, I'd recommend using the valet as it is much easier and the same price. Check-in is at 3 and we arrived about 10:30 and our room was ready. Front desk was extremely courteous and answered all questions. Lobby is very nice. A staff member was in the lobby checking to make sure everyone had what they needed - paper, cab, etc. Room was very nice - corner room. Very clean. Very comfortable bed. Very nice furnishings.Bathroom was very nice and clean. Bigger than others we've had at Boston hotels. Had drinks in the bar. Great location and views. Super service.Had dinner in the restaurant there. Top notch service and food. Very impressive! Prices matched quality.Had the brunch buffet the next morning. The omlet was one of the best I've ever had. The rest of the buffet food probably was excellent when it was hot, but when we got there is was luke-warm at best. Slow service (seating, getting the chef, etc.) Price a bit high for what we got.Paper delivered to door in AM. Check out was easy (although not as friendly as the check-in).No tipping is allowed in the hotel (you pay a set service fee with the bill).Beautiful views (we walked all over the hotel, checking out the views from the Ballrooms, etc.). Great business services. Great gym. But oddly, the room safe was one of those tiny ones, not big enough for a laptop!Great time! Wished we were able to stay a few more nights. Highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Business trip to Boston I went up to Boston on a business trip recently. First of all, if you haven't been to Boston before (I had not), here are some things you'll need to know:(1) In the airport, when going to catch a bus, if you keep following the signs for the bus that have an arrow and say something along the lines of 'stay inside', you'll end up at the security offices at the end of the terminal. We had to ask someone where 'outside' we needed to go.(2) Once we caught the bus (silver I think), we asked if it went to Seaport. We were assured that it dropped you off right across the street. OK, great. However, when you get dropped off and exit the station, there are no signs or anything to indicate which large building in the vicinity is your hotel. We actually had to pull out a picture and start comparing building profiles before we struck out towards one and found it. It *is* actually 'across the street' - the key is figuring out *which* street. Don't get me started on the lack of street signage in that town...Anyway, on to the hotel. The lobby was very nice, as was the restaurant/bar area. From this impression, I thought we were in for some pretty swanky digs. The swank ends in the lobby. Now don't get me wrong - the room was clean and served all our needs, but there were several things I noticed... First - the room was small. Now, granted, I didn't pay for it since it was a business trip, but based on the nightly rate, and given that we were not even in downtown proper, the rate seemed a bit on the high side for the room we got. It made me think of a room one might expect at the Holiday Inn, La Quinta, or the like. Not a hotel with a World Trade Center slapped onto the side of it. Second - the bathroom was small and average. Sure, they had bath products and all that stuff, but it felt tiny and it wasn't very 'glitzy' per se. Usually rooms costing this much wow you a little with the bathroom (whether it is a little marbling inside, or maybe a jacuzzi tub or something). This one didn't. The vanity was *right* next to the toilet which was *right* next to the small tub/shower combo. I imagine a bath in that tub wouldn't be very comfortable, either.Third - the proximity to food/entertainment was a bit annoying. There was a bar and grill, a swanky seafood place, a 7-11, and a Dunkin' Donuts (always good) within walking distance. For anything else, you'd have to trek to downtown, which is 15-20 minute walk to the edge, and about another 10 minutes in before you get to any of the bars/restaurants. Again, with a rate this high, I expected a prime location. Not so much. It was close to the job site we were going to, however, so that was a plus.The staff seemed friendly, and we got our wake-up calls on time every morning as well as our complimentary paper. We didn't dine at the hotel restaurant, so I can't speak to that. Overall, I don't know that I'd go back unless it was to that specific job site, since it was within walking distance. If I was going to Boston for pleasure, I would probably stay somewhere downtown. If I'm going to pay top dollar for a small room, I better be about 5 minutes walking distance from everything I want to do.

<Content>TravelAgent Review I went to the Seaport to work at the World Trade Center which is across the street from the Seaport. Location was fantasticCabs easily available in front of hotelDoormen very friendly and personable, MOST of hotel staff sameAURA Bar/Resteraunt.... quite overpriced (but its a hotel resteraunt what do you expect?)Aura BAR food ... decent to okayThe rooms furnishings and decor were average of a Radisson or low budget MarriottOverall, we got the hotel free b/c was for business and if I had to work the area again, this hotel would be fine for 1-3 nights Had pool but NO JACUZZI or steam room/saunaThey did CHARGE us for the minibar which was NEVER touched (even had the string still attached) but they waived off our bill

<Content>Great place to stay and see the Red Sox on Father's Day!!! The rooms were very nice and above average. The hotel staff was extremely pleasant and went out of there way at every chance. My wife bought a package they offered for Father's day and I brought my 6 year old son with me. The pool was awesome with great views (windows all around it) and we had it almost all to ourselves!We were able to get to the ball game very easily now that the Big Dig is almost all done so I'd say that this hotel is extremely easy to get to and it offers underground parking. The streets are wide and very well planned for easy access to any part of Boston.I'd definately do it again and my son will remember this experience for the rest of his life!Thank you!

<Content>A bit pricey but comfortable...location is ok I just spent a Saturday night at the Seaport with my wife. At $200 for a room, we had some high expectations. Since we've stayed at the Hotel Marlowe (an awesome experience) in Cambridge, most of the hotels in Boston just feel bland and average.Service: We found this to be a mixed bag. At check-in, our initial experience was just OK. We mentioned that it was our anniversary and requested a nice room. The clerk issued a mild shrug and then provided our keys. We were both dissapointed. The room was small, bland, and simply had a view of the nearby building. It was nothing special.However, after discussing the situation with the concierge, we were placed in a very comfortable mini suite with 2 rooms (bed room and 2nd room with couch and TV). We did not have a view of the water, but the room was comfortable and nice. The concierge was extremely helpful and friendly.Location: We took a harbor cruise, so the location was excellent. The hotel is located next to the world trade center and across from the pier. There is also a MBTA stop adjacent to the hotel. The area feels very 'corporate' and not like traditional boston. Think conventions, office buildings, and a pier. It does have very easy access to I93, so getting into/out of the area is extremely easy.The hotel bar is nice and the interior is clean and fresh. The decoration is a bit bland and neutral.Without our requirement to walk to the harbor cruise, I'd rather stay at the Marlowe or try the Onyx.

<Content>Good for business travel. The Seaport Hotel in Boston is a very good choice for business travel, though on the pricey side, but then you'd expect this in a major city like Boston. The hotel seems fairly new and is very convenient to Logan Airport. The hotel is directly across the street from the harbor and you can catch a water taxi, cross the harbor and then get a free shuttle bus right at the dock to your airport terminal---a 5 minute ride, fairly painless. The Spirit of Boston dinner cruise boat is also directly across the street as well as the WTC convention center and several seafood restaurants.The hotel was clean, service good, appointments nice but the room itself I felt was on the small side. The furnishings were good but I expected more for the money except for the bathroom which was tops. A nice touch was the Bose Wave alarm clock/radio which provided really great wake-up music, not one of those little cheapies you usually get.I was on the 14th floor and the views were great but I wasn't in the room long enough to appreciate it. There was a bar/lounge on the lobby level serving food and a pricey restaurant. I ate in the bar and had a $10 hamburger. The bun was humongous, the burger smallish and overdone.Overall I liked the place and would return but if coming on vacation or tourist travel I would select a place more centrally located to the sites. As it was we were a couple mile walk to the Quincy Market, etc. although you could take a cab.

<Content>Glad I Didn't Pay For It I was snowed in at the Seaport for an entire weekend in January. I was up for a work function, and we didn't really expect that. The hotel was full, and it was pretty clear they were overwhelmed with all the people onsite who couldn't get out. I know the total shut down of Boston prevented staff from getting in, and so I can't quite fault the hotel, but they handled their existing staff really poorly. I'm quite sure we would have forgone having a turndown service if it mean that there would be quicker service in the main restaurant. Which was hideously overpriced, even for a hotel lobby restaurant.Add to that, the front desk staff was incredibly snooty, and couldn't seem to find rooms for us, even though they'd been promised again and again and again. Forget the early check-in we'd requested, the rooms didn't become available until 4:30, which was well after the time we were supposed to have been in the World Trade Center. And they were blatantly unapologetic.It's a lovely hotel in an 80s retro kind of way, but the service is the pits.

<Content>Had wonderful time My husband and I spent a weekend at the Seaport Hotel while seeing a concert at the Pavillion in Boston. We were with a group of eight who wanted to stay here. After having read some negative reviews I decided that I really wanted to stay at the Boston Harbor Hotel as I already know that I love it there. However since the deluxe king room there was more than double the price at the Seaport I decided to stay there with the group; more politically correct anyway. Am I really glad we did! We had a wonderful time. The staff was just terrific and I love the service being included. You never tip here and everyone bends over backward to be courteous. I don't think I've ever had so many people say good morning to me in a hotel. The deluxe king room was the same size as at the Boston Harbor which was plenty of room. I don't understand the small room size' complaint. I was not guaranteed a harbor view but for the money that was OK. Lucky me I got a harbor view from the 15 floor. It was wonderful. The bed and pillows were also very comfortable. Down feather pillows which I always use.The new silver line for the MBTA (subway) for Boston is open next door so getting around town is now a breeze. We walked to the New England Aquarium on Sunday along the Harbor Walk. It was very pleasant and we needed the exercise after our huge buffet breakfast Sunday morning. I also ordered from room service several times and it was quick and very good. Saturday evening I wanted a desert that was not listed on the room service menu. No problem, they were happy to oblige. It is true that the hotel is geared toward business visitors, there is a complimantary business center and two computers in the lobby area for guest use. I was not interested in this but some guests not working could still enjoy e-mail. Overall I think this hotel is great; particularly for the price and the friendly staff

<Content>Business Travel I had fairly low expectations of this hotel based on some of the previous reviews. I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and the good service I received throughout my stay. My check-in was a breeze and I was given a corner room with a nice view of the harbor. While the room itself was fairly bland, it was comfortable, clean and overall pleasing to my very particular taste. I agree that the location is not ideal for a tourist, but for a business traveler, the location is quite good. Overall, I had a good experience.

<Content>Sheer dissapointment - With no expectations My fiance surprised me on our anniversary weekend (memorial day weekend) with a little getaway into Boston (our neighboring city and where in fact, we had both gone to college) since we were too busy with work to manage a more distant trip. I'd like to preface this by saying that given that since this was a complete surprise to me, I had zero expectations. I will be very frank - I have stayed in many hotels ranging from a Four Seasons to a Super 8; as well as many hotels in Boston. The #1 criteria for me are these: a.) Cleanliness and b.) Customer Service and c.) Value. If you're paying for grade A service, you are entitled to receive it, if you are paying for B service, don't expect A service. At best, I'd say our room was small, though it was clean. I was surprised at the rates we were charged for standard size room. The bed covering seemed cheap, and bed itself was uncomfortable to merely sit on. Aside from that, it was about the size and aesthetic of a dorm room with carpeting.Location - For people visiting, I would strongly suggest you stay closer to the city as this hotel is really meant for business purposes. The area completely shuts down at night and there is nothing to see once you take a stroll through the deserted courtyard. An empty wharf, a shut down warehouse and what appeared to be a seafood restaurant somewhere down the way. All in all, we spent about 1/2 an hour in the room, surveying the contents and trying to make do with what was available to us. After seeing the completely deserted restaurant, and realized there really were not any available areas for even a quick snack we decided to try elsewhere. What made me give this review a 'Terrible' as opposed to an Okay or even a Neutral, was the attitude the Manager downstairs dispensed to us after we had very amicably explained our situation. We were not expecting a 100% full refund. That would have been nice, and in my mind, probably the best customer service they could have provided -- but CERTAINLY not the argument of you are from the area, you should know better. Instead of walking away from the situation with both parties satisfied, the manager on duty chose to charge us $50, openly claiming we had dirtied the room after we offered for them to come up and please look at the room we were given [for condition and quality], claim that our complaint or reason for leaving was bogus all in somewhat of a distasteful manner. I think, the charge may have been fair, I expected better manners, customer service and poise from a hotel that praises themselves in the regard in which they do on their website and I'm completely dissapointed that we have extended ourselves to what we thought was an A/B Hotel and was met with D or Failing service and paid for it. I only hope that sharing my experience will help the hotel reform their management or deter some visitors from wasting their time.If you are a visitor to Boston, I have always, always had great luck with the Marriot Copley. You can easily find your way to the waterfront via cab or T and the rooms are easily 2x-3x the size with 3x the quality of what you are getting.

<Content>Dingy, Uncomfortable and Vacant My fiance and I decided to stay in boston for the weekend. I read good things about the Seaport Hotel and they were running a promo so I booked us there. We had a harbor-view room, which was not harbor view. It faced another building and if you really turned your head you could look at the harbor. Do not be fooled by the pictures of the rooms, it doesn't look like that. The comforter on the bed looked like it was from the 1970's and it felt disgusting. The room was dark and drab. Incredibly plain. We decided we'd try to make a go of it and went out to look around. There is nothing around the hotel. The pool is just a lap pool, not very relaxing and no hot tub in there. We decided we were just going to leave, it was not at all what we were expecting. We went to complain after an hour of being there and the hotel manager was completely unreceptive to my feedback. He said he has never heard a complaint before... (not exactly superb customer service). He informed me I was from Acton, MA, i should know what this hotel is like. Bottomline, he refused to let us leave without a $50 payment for room cleaning. Well, I hope the $50 is worth all the bad reviews my fiance and I are posting. I don't think I have ever been so unsatisfied in my life.

<Content>great staff We had a great trip with our pup to Boston. The staff was terrific and we felt exceptionally welcome. The indoor pool was great, but it is a small lap pool and they should have a kiddie area. The indoor gym was good too. The weather was terrible one day and my husband and I enjoyed having a casual dinner in the bar area watching the boats and the airplanes take off from Logan. Yes, the location isn't prime b/c you have to schlep to the subway. It is close to the children's museum.

<Content>GREAT customer service BAD location if you're a tourist ROOMS: Average. Nothing great, not luxury if that's what you are expecting. Feels very business class, in other words, beige and cream interior, ship theme art, blonde wood furniture that has an IKEA feel to it. Again, nothing great. I only paid a special rate of $99 so to me, it was fine. If I had paid normal rates I would have been disappointed. Bathrooms are great, I liked the city, the marble and granite, the water pressure in the shower was good. The tubs are not deep though, so don't expect a long comfortable soak. Mattress and Pillows are great. TV movies are $10.95, not worth it. ROOM TIP:Ask for upper floor harborside because most city side views give you a view of a large building. GYM: Nice. Clean. Small hallway shape. Rude receptionist, acted like I was bothering her by asking where cardio machines were located (my first time). Mostly men on business trips trying to maintain 55+ yr old bodies. Not an eye candy gym. Clean though, nice clean locker room.RECEPTION/CONCIERGE: Friendly, Informative, Professional. Best part of experience.LOCATION: BAD unless you are attending conference at the World Trade Center, which is attached. City is so close, but yet so far, no public transportation so you either walk 30 minutes to attractions or you call a cab because they don't stay in the area for long. Only good walking distance resturant is Anthony's Pier = seafood is great. ROOM SERVICE: Room service is $26 for a 10 cheese pizza (after fees and tax) so call Domino's - they deliver right to your room. Resturant in the hotel lacks ambiance. Food is overpriced but okay to the palette. Gift shop, lobby, bar, lobby, bake shop are all very nice but very business class feeling - nothing really special or exclusive. CLEANLINESS: Five Stars. No hairs in tub or on floor or sink which is rare in frequently visited hotels. The room sparkled, which to me, matters immensely.Would I stay again? Yes if I were attending a trade show, NO if I were there to hang out in Boston because the location totally -----.

<Content>Best Deal in Boston, Highly Recommend The Seaport represents one of the best deals in Boston. If you can deal with being a mile or so from Downtown you can get a 5 Star Hotel at a bargain price. The accomodations are excellent, especially the corner rooms. Restaurant and bar serve great food. The staff are helpful. The staff cannot except tips, so gratuity is added automatically to everything. The hotel offers free internet access and wireless access everywhere. I highly recommend this hotel if you can stand being away from the downtown action.

<Content>Not impressed, uncomfortable beds! We were just not impressed with the Seaport hotel. Our harbor view room required serious neck-craining and an eventual view of a barge. Our deluxe room was as standard as hotel rooms get and both my husband and I woke up with terrible backaches. The beds are awful! I'm sure the restaurant's food is good, but we left before our $4.00 cup of tea was served. $4.00 for hot tea? Geesh. The staff was pleasant and helpful, though not worth the price.

<Content>Seaport Hotel- Poor customer service I had a reservation at the Seaport Hotel three weeks ago. I had stayed there several times and it was great.Not on this day. I had asked not to be put in an executive suite, a 400square foot hole;I confirmed this with the reservations desk, and the front desk the day before arrival. I again confirmed this at the time of check in. As I entered the room, I realized that this was the same, now smaller, pit with a bedroon that was barey large enough to get around the bed. Despite asking ever so nicely several times for a room change,none was ever offered. I checked out and stayed at the Boston Harbor- far far nicer and in fact cheaper.This is the first time that I cancelled a hotel stay because of poor service. Caveat emptor!!

<Content>Not that great I recently stayed at the Seaport Hotel for a conference. It is really just not that great. The rooms are average. And what they say is true: you can hear EVERY TOILET in the hotel flushing. The service was great though, and I definitely appreciated their no-tipping policy. My room had a view of a parking lot, so I was definitely disappointed. Also, the hotel is not close to ANYTHING, but we took a short cab ride to the North End for some great Italian restaurants.

<Content>Nice hotel, location not ideal for a vacation First off I must state that I do not travel often, and thus do not stay in hotels very often. I chose the Seaport because after reading various reviews for other Boston hotels, some of which weren't great, I chose Seaport for the good reviews I had read about it, and because the price wasn't too over the top. I'll start with what I liked about the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and they answered every question I had to my satisfaction. Check in and out were quick, baggage was delivered to the room promptly, and picked up within 5 minutes of my call to the front desk upon departure. They even gave my 1 year old daughter a little teddy bear while we were checking in. They supplied us with brochures and driving directions for things my family wanted to do outside of the city. As far as staff goes, I would rate the Seaport top notch. The computers in the lobby with high speed net access were nice when I wanted to check my email. The free USA Today paper weekday mornings was a nice surprise that I did not know about. About the room. It was very clean, but other than that was nothing special. There were enough draws and closet space for 2 adults and 1 child for our 5 day stay. Upon arrival, the crib, refrigerator, and microwave we requested were already there in the room. The view from the room was nothing amazing. Very deceiving is the main picture that most travel sites use for the Seaport. It looks as if the building is free standing on the water with nothing around it. Well either that picture is old or has been edited, because there are buildings as tall or taller on either side of it, which cuts down on the view dramatically. The bed in the room was also rather uncomfortable. The bathroom was nice with the marble tile and counters, but the water pressure for taking a shower was awful. The toilet was also very noisy when flushing, which wasn't fun with a baby sleeping in the room if you know what I mean! We did not use the gym or the pool at all, so I cannot really review them. I had wanted to use the pool, but again the pictures you see online are a bit deceiving, as the pool is much smaller that it appears, so with all the kids in there I decided against it. The restaurant sure smelled great every time we walked past it. I heard good things about it, so we decided to have breakfast there one morning. The food was nothing special, all the basics, pancakes, eggs, bacon, cereal, etc. For $42 for that, for 2 people, needless to say it was the first and last time we ate there. Parking for the hotel is in a public lot below the building. It is $25 a day for self park, or $35 for valet. I opted for self park, which was fine, but depending on the time you go to park, you may have a decent walk to an elevator since it fills up at times. There are outdoor lots right down the block that signs said were $7 or $8, so they might be worth looking into to save some money. There is a lot of construction going on in Boston right now, and a LOT of it is in the area around the Seaport. While they claim the hotel is in walking distance of things like the aquarium and Quincy Market, unless you feel like walking past noisy and dusty areas, you wont be walking too many places around the hotel. All is not lost though, since free shuttles run all day from just outside the hotel into a few spots more centrally located in the city, up until midnight. They don't run on weekends though which kinda stinks. Overall I guess I would recommend the hotel. It was a pleasant stay other than the few minor gripes I listed. The surroundings are basically out of the hotel's control, but it would be nice if they informed of such things.

<Content>GREAT HOTEL My husband, son, and I went to Boston the first week of August, 2004. We were very impressed with this hotel. The staff was courtious and very helpful. The location was close enough to the Boston Aquarium and Quincy Market that we were able to walk from there to the hotel. The rooms were very nice and quiet. The lap pool was a pleasant way to relax and cool off. My son, age 10, thought the pool was the best part. There was a variety of restaurants within walking distance, many of them right on the water. If we return to Boston, we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>What a great hotel and location! Our family just returned from a wonderful 3 night stay at the Seaport Hotel. We arrived very late at night (9:30) so we experienced no problem checking in. The staff is extrememly polite, friendly and helpful which to mean means the most! We went there with our two children ages 6 and 8 and they were so nice to them when we were checking in. The pool was overcrowded due to the children's package going on but we managed to get in for a nice swim. The hotel is very clean and the rooms a decent size. We checked out using the express service without issue.I must point out that we got a room viewing the harbor and the airport...what a duo! We got to watch all the planes coming and going as well as the beautiful reflection of lights on the harbor water.This hotel is out of the whole Boston atmosphere which lets you escape to solitude for awhile. As planned we got lost at least twice a day due to Boston's horrible street signs or lack of...the concierge was excellent with directions so ask him before you venture out on your own or with maps.Parking is ridiculous in Boston...had to pay the 25 flat rate at the hotel and if we moved our car we got nailed another 25 minimum...next time we take the bus and use taxi's...otherwise we had an awesome time and this hotel is GREAT!

<Content>Seaport Hotel is a solid four star We have stayed in Seaport Hotel over Memorial weekend and had really wonderful time.This place is a solid four star Hotel. The property is still like brand new and the room charge was very reasonable. Guests rooms are nicely appointed and don't look cheap. You can relax and enjoy a comfort. Lobby, bar and restoraunt were beautifully presented. To me as a woman the most gorgeous thing about interior was real snow-white orchids all over the public places.Even though we put an excellent mark to this review there are few problems we'd like to note:1) the noiseproof is not great. You can hear toilets flushing.2) there is no public transportation to the hotel door. The walk is about 10 min to the nearest subway station and it can be quite unpleasant if weather is not great3) the hotel parking is a bit pricey ( 25$/day ), but there is an attended lot 5 min away with a rate of 16$/dayWe would definetely stay again.

<Content>Wonderful hotel and location My wife joined me for a 3 day weekend in Boston in late June. I am often on the road for my business, staying at your typical business category hotels. On the rare occassions that my wife is able to join me, I like to go up a category or two in hotel quality and ammenities. The Seaport Hotel was the perfect choice for our time away together. The rooms were a nice size, the beds were very comfortable, and linens were high quality. The rooms were quiet, and the high speed internet was complimentary (almost a necessity these days for the business traveller). We were give a room with a view of the Boston harbor on the 11th floor. The hotel is sandwiched between the two World Trade Center buildings, so the view was sort of sideways, but nice none the less.The hotel staff was efficient and courteous. There was a nice restaurant in the hotel but the prices were pretty steep, so we went out to the local restaurants for some great seafood. The location was great. It is jut far enough away from the central downtown area to be devoid of heavy traffic and noise, but close enough to easily walk to downtown or the touristy wharf area. And walking there was very pleasant, along the wharfs and waterfront of Boston harbor. A very nice clean safe part of town. They are just finishing up a subway station a couple of blocks away, so if you need inexpensive transportation and don't want to walk this is the way to go. Otherwise taxis are always waiting at the front of the hotel to take you to your destination. The No Name restaurant was a pleasant surprise. Great fish and chowders at great prices. Located on the working wharf almost across the street, it has a friendly homestyle atmosphere with views of the working harbor. Nothing fancy but just right for a good lunch.If you have a car, parking was a bit steep at $25 per day. Since you can get almost anywhere in the area on public transportation or walking, a car was not necessary. The hotel does not have a shuttle to Logan airport, even though it is a short ride through the new tunnel (just on the other side of the Bay). A taxi ride is about $20 to $25 from the airport. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. Very nice experience.

<Content>First Class Hotel! The Seaport Hotel is a first class place. When my wife and I arrived, we were greeted by a friendly and helpful staff. The rooms was adequately sized, with all the expected amenities. As mentioned in other reviews, there is about a 10-15 minute walk to the South Street T station, which didn't really bother us, but people should know about that before deciding to stay at the Seaport. Having said that, there is a T Station being built just outside of the Seaport, and it looked like it was just about finished. That was in the middle of May 2004, so it could be open by now.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I had a a wonderful stay at this hotel and experienced none of the problems reported in other reviews. Check-in was instantaneous and desk staff and concierge very helpful and the hotel was very quiet. I was very surprised that one review described wear and tear in the room - my room looked brand new. Decor is tasteful. The hotel is a little isolated from the city but good restaurants and cafes are within easy walking distance if you don't want to take the shuttle or a taxi. There will be a T (subway) stop at the hotel when they finish building it (this is Boston so don't hold your breath.)I like the no tipping policy. The beautiful view of the harbor made up for the inconvenience of the distance from the city.

<Content>Best in Boston The seaport is a wonderful hotel with all the necessary amenities: restaurant, pool, gym and free high-speed internet access in the lobby.Upon my arrival at 11pm, the staff were friendly and efficient. A porter helped us with our luggage which was particularly appreciated because of the 'no tipping' policy! The room was spacious and attractively furnished with two double beds. I also ordered room service at midnight and not only was the lobster club sandwich delicious, but the chef himself brought it to my room and was very courteous.The restaurant was exceptional; I had the buffet breakfast there every morning and the quality of both food and service was excellent.The view from the room overlooked the harbour and was particularly pretty at night despite the persistent rain!As a first-time visitor to Boston, I used the Trolley Car Tours to navigate my way around for the first two days, which was convenient as it stopped right outside the hotel. To get to the more central area of Boston a taxi is required, but the hotel location was very peaceful.The concierge was very helpful in booking tickets to the Boston Pops (a must!), and the doorman will assist you into one of the many taxis waiting outside.A stay at the Seaport is memorable, friendly and great value for money!

<Content>Has Potential, but Overrated The Seaport truly is a beautiful hotel with great decor, spacious rooms, and nice amenities. However, I've stayed several times (not by choice) and am blown away by others' glowing reviews, as I am constantly disappointed. Given that, the reason I've stayed is because it is the only hotel in the immediate area, and I've stayed as a guest attending a wedding in the hotel, as well as a couple other parties at the World Trade Center across the street. The location is prime for WTC visitors, and will be great for convention-goers. However, the check-in process is HORRIBLE. Each time (three, so far) I've had to wait over 1.5 hours to check in - with the line extending way past the lobby, restaurant, and gift shop. In addition, twice the express check-out feature in the room was unavailable due to technical difficulties. In addition, the staff is okay - not particularly knowledgeable, pleasant, or accommodating, but not necessarily rude, either. There is a lot of potential here, but they need better management to get the staff and logistics up to par. Also - parking in the garage was very unclear the last time I was there, so our spot was underground quite far from the lobby. I've been told that clearer signage has been put up since, however. I will be there again for another holiday party this weekend, and hope it will have improved. The worst part is definitely the 1.5+ hour wait for check-in during any event that may attract more than a handful of guests checking in at once (wedding, holiday party, corporate function, etc). At this time, it is EXTREMELY inconvenient in terms of location if you are on vacation - it is separated from Boston by a channel, and there is no convenient public transportation at this time, though the city is working on it (Silver Line bus transportation).

<Content>My Experience at the Seaport Hotel Recently, I attended an art gallery opening across the way from your hotel. I found your wait staff to be friendly and accommodating, especially Denise and Mike.When we received our bill for cocktails, I was astounded at the price for cocktails, namely, a Manhatten-$15.00/Martini $15.00. Setting that aside, when it came time to pay our bill, we were not cognizant of the fact that a 15% gratuity was already factored in. If it wasn't for the honesty of your wait staff, we would have been overly charged regarding our 20% tip. I probably could say Shame on us for not being more aware of our bill. In conclusion, the only possibility of our returning to your hotel for dinner or cocktails would be for the honesty of your staff. I am a South Bostonian, your neighbor, and I will pass this info buyer beware to my friends from South Boston and surrounding areas.Sincerely,Bev Cormier Ritz

<Content>Great Stay At Lovely Hotel Stayed here in July 03 on trip to celebrate my dad's 60th Birthday. I had searched and searched the Internet for somewhere within a budget, but still suitably impressive for a family celebratory trip. All 6 in our party were not disappointed. The hotel was a little business like, not that this is a problem, and rooms were excellent and very big. The staff were very helpful (recommendations for food, reservations, transport etc.), and the no tipping policy is good. We were also left a complimentary cheese board and soft drinks platter on arrival as an apology for no one getting back to me to answer some questions I had E-mailed a few days before we left the UK. The bar seemed a little expensive in comparison to others in Boston, so we didnt use it after the first night. The location is OK, as it is right by the waterside, but it is a 10/15-minute walk into the main attractions. There is a courtesy bus however (weekdays only) into a more central part of Boston, near the T station which is free of charge, and makes things much easier. Once youre there Boston is great and really easy to get around on the T or by foot. The water taxi from the airport is a great way to arrive (drops directly opposite the hotel) and to see Boston skyline. Finally, Duck Tours to see around Boston, my Dad loved it and even got to drive the Duck, but book early!

<Content>Very Average Booked a stay at the Seaport Memorial Day weekend after seeing many favorable recomendations. Purpose of trip was get away weekend with no kids.We were some what disappointed although the hotel did have some good features. I will list the pros and cons:Room- average but sound proofing was poor. Hotel was very noisy and we were awoken several times during the night from teens in the hall and other rooms (slamming doors/in and out etc). Room was starting to show wear and tear.Amenities in bathroom such as robe and tolietries were nice quality.Front desk nice- Clerk gave us a corner room with a nice view of the harbor. The public areas are nice and modern.Pool/gym- nice but small. Looks they are upgrading the area.Location- poor. hard to get around city from this location. Think public transportation will be serving the area soon but it was tough when we were there. would not have been bad in nice weather- but not nice walk to nearest T (10-15 minutes) in cool damp weather. After paying $25 for parking you do not want to to pay to park all over the city- would have been nice to be closer to the T or have some sort of bus service (which in May did not run on the weekends)The one advantage I see for location is if you are going in the warm weather with kids. The walk to the Childrens museum and aquarium would not be bad and the hotel seems to cater to these type trips.Overall like I said the hotel is not bad but just very average. I travel a lot for business and stay at many hotels up and down the east coast each year. I was expecting more. Next time we go into Boston for a get away weekend I would try another hotel before going back.

<Content>Great hotel in an excellent location We booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this web site and were not disappointed. We had a lovely room overlooking the harbour. It is a pleasant walk into town with all its wonderful sights. A beautiful city which we will visit again and would definitely stay at the Seaport Hotel if we can get the same price.

<Content>Loved the Seaport We recently spent three nights in Boston at the Seaport Hotel. They have access to a bus shuttle that picks you up and drops off at three locations in Boston......really handy. The hotel is gorgeous and first class (even fresh live flowers in the rest rooms). The staff was helpful and courteous. The room was very nice, especially the bathroom. The plaza level has a very nice fitness facility and a rather small lap pool. The adjoining locker rooms are top of the line with every amenity imagineable. The lobby restaurant is extremely expensive, but the bakery/cafe is not.....with excellent pastries and asssorted breakfast foods. The prices are steep through the hotel itself, but through one of the travel websites, not bad at all. We LOVED this hotel!

<Content>Seaport Hotel.... Stayed here over the 4th of July weekend. Liked the hotel. If you have the money, stay there. Expensive to park in their parking garage, so be prepared. If you check in late, bring your own snacks, room service is very pricey.....Staff was very cordial. It's nice to be a short distance from Logan and the South Station too. You can walk to the children's museum or to the aquarium if you are up for the exercise. It is a cheap cab fare to it though. Make sure you see Faneuil Hall and all that is around it. If you are up for a duck tour, get your tickets in advance. We didn't and missed a great opportunity to see Boston that way. We did use the Cityview Trolley and they were great though. We saw stuff we would have missed had we not used them.
