<Content>Continued Excellence Back in Tokyo on business and following my last stay, I'm back at the Westin. So far, again, the hotel is living up to my expectations. Despite being slightly far from the office, this is a great hotel in a peaceful area to which to unwind and relax. Seeing we're in Tokyo for 10 days, we wanted that home-away-from-home experience and myself and my colleagues are certainly experiencing this at the moment. If anything changes, I'll certainly post the experience, but I'm sure it will get better!Highly recommended.

<Content>Nickels and dimes I have stayed at the westin on a number of occasions in the past.The price continues to climb , but I have nonetheless remained faithful to the place , and have recommended it to a number of friends. The service has always been by and large exceptional , and thoughtful smiling staff go along way to help you .E ven though I lived in tokyo for many years they can certainly smooth things out for the tired traveller. My big complaint which will cause me to rethink staying again , is the nickel and dime approach to services a 500 yen fee for the access to the computer ( bberry not working ) and a 300 yen charge for making a connection to a long distance provider , and a an almost 500 yen charge for making a local phone call? When you are staying on the executive floor paying premium rates you really dont expect this

<Content>Good if it's on your business account If you're visiting Tokyo for personal pleasure, another hotel would probably be a better choice. The Westin is pretty pricey, and the location is midway between two subway stops (Ebisu is the better stop.) Bathroom is large and spacious, but I hate how on top of a $350 room, they charge near $20 for Internet , when other Japanese business hotels will give you internet for free.Pros: 2 American TV channels, large bathroom, Westin heavenly bed, good business conciergeCons: Inconvenient location, price, no view

<Content>Great Hotel, Average Location Stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 3 nights in September. My husband and I were touring Japan and chose the Westin for our stay in Tokyo.The positives: -BEAUTIFUL hotel, fantastic staff. Our room was HUGE and perfect. It was very clean. -The Ebisu area is fantastic. It's so new and modern. There are tons of restaurants and bars to explore.-Quiet and out of the Tokyo hustle and bustle. It was a really peaceful part of the city.-Ebisu is a great location on the subway line to see the city.. however... (see below)The negative:-The hotel was pretty far from the metro stop. Yes, they have moving walkways, and it is probably less than 15 minutes to the subway. BUT, mid-day, while we were touring around, we would have loved to come back to the hotel to freshen up before dinner. This seemed like a HUGE out-of-the-way task because of the hotel's distance from the metro.Overall, I would recommend the hotel to people that were going to Tokyo for business, not really for touring. Unless you plan to leave in the morning and come back to go to bed, it's too much of a pain to hike back and forth from the hotel to the metro more than once.

<Content>How a hotel should be! A short walk on the Skyway from JR Ebisu station East Exit or a 3 minute taxi ride and you are transported to another world away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Thoughtful service that makes you smile and well furnished rooms ensure that you are relaxed. The award winning Executive Lounge is worth the extra as is the view.

<Content>Great service, nice hotel area, service and food... The room was 4 stars, the service was 5 stars. I went for a run in the morning and when I arrived back at the hotel, a bus person handed me cold bottled water upon my return. What can top that! The food was great for a buffet. Fresh grapefruit and orange juice hand squeezed for breakfast. Lunch included a good shrimp and scallops dish, grilled fish, and great green salads. All in all, a great business stay. It is a distance from NRT (what isn't) , but once you are there you can get to the main downtown areas in a short amount of time.

<Content>Service to Remember The hotel service was outstanding, the food was a bit pricey but excellent and there are plenty of nearby restaurants within just a short 3 minute walk.Room was very clean with comfortable bed and bathroom.About a 10 minute walk to Ebisu station makes it fairly convenient - but I agree with the other reviews - this probably isn't easy with a lot of luggage (I never take more than a small knapsack and briefcase) so for me it wasn't an issue.The best part of the hotel is the service. It doesn't get much better than this....Example: Caught in the rain one day - before I even reached the front door someone was handing me a clean dry towel...nice touch.Would not hesitate to stay here again if I have business in this area of Tokyo.

<Content>Typical Westin; out of the way for business trips This is a typical Westin. Nothing much to remember, either positive or negative. the staff was professional staff and rooms were clean and well-appointed. The carpets seem jaded but were more than made up by the bath rooms which seem to have been refurbished recently. The restaurants were OK but pricey. For business travellers, this hotel is a little bit away from the Tokyo central area where most offices are. It takes about 40 minutes in peak hour by taxi. (Since taxi drivers don't understand English, don't forget to take those little chits with the hotel address in Japanese that they have at the concierge desk !!)

<Content>Great Hotel, but a bit off the map... I agree with the previous review, the Westin Tokyo is a great hotel once you get there. Ebisu is easily accessible by train, but the hotel is located on a hill ABOVE the train station. It is not that easy to reach the Westin when travelling with heavy bags or young children. Eebisu is a quiet neighborhood compared to Shinjuku or Ginza, yet you will find many dining options in the area.The hotel is very nice. It has a really fancy deco - marble in many areas, columns (!) in the room, and gold accents. rooms are clean and well appointed. The hotel being located above the city, we had a view on the Mount Fuji from our room! Service is well above average, as expected in a Westin.I recommend the hotel to travelers not afraid of walking! any party travelling with children, or elderly, should maybe pick a more central location.

<Content>Great hotel once you get there I travel to Tokyo a lot on business and as an elite SPG traveller wanted to try the Westin purely to earn points. It is a very classy hotel located in the Yebisu Garden district.The hotel is done up in that Japanese styled European elegance that must have been popular during the bubble. Service is impeccable and the hotel has recently added a Westin workout facility that's top notch. Rooms are nice, typical of what you'd expect for a Westin, and decent size. Bathrooms are marble/granite in construction and nice seperate stall shower and tub. And of course the room features an exciting high tech Japanese toilet. The hotel features an executive lounge with cocktails in the evening and breakfast in the morning for frequent guests. Cocktails are generous with full bar and nice selection of appetizers. The breakfast is also generous and filled with amusing options such as green salad (for breakfast?). The Westin staff has learned a bit about western tastes since I was last at the property and are now serving crispy bacon alongside the limp traditional offering.The Yebisu Garden complex provides a lot of dining options (so you're not limited to the $150 sushi sampler on the room service menu) as well as shopping and international ATM at a post office branch. I ate at a traditional tonkatsu location (Japanese fried pork that tastes a bit like weiner schnitzel) and at a yakiniku (Japanese style Korean BBQ) restaurant, but the options were varied and offered options in a variety of price ranges.So...what's not to like? Unfortunately the one major drawback to the Westin is its location. The Ebisu subway station is a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel through the Yebisu Garden complex, and Ebisu is not necessarily close to traditional Tokyo business districts. Check into this consideration when booking your stay as at the end of a long business day or sightseeing venture this could be a drawback.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel in Tokyo My husband and I stayed at the Westin Tokyo for four nights in early June. This was our first time to Japan and we were not disappointed with the accomodations. From the minute we walked into the hotel, we were greeted enthusiastically. We were assisted with every request we had whether it be needing directions to a certain location in town or getting a restaurant recommendation. The concierege was pleasant and helpful. I was a little worried about the location in Tokyo but with how efficient the subways are we found it was just a few minute ride to any location we wanted to see. It was 2 stops to Roppongi Hills and about 5 stops to the fish market (about as far as you need to go in Tokyo). The hotel was classy, elegant and the room had fabulous features. The shower was wonderful, the bathroom was very modern and our bedroom had an area with a couch and chair. There were two options for breakfast-a buffet on the 1st floor which was excellent and a continental breakfast if you were an SPG preferred guest. Both were very nice for us. It will be a while until I get back to Japan as it's a far trip and there are a lot of places my husband and I want to see, but when I do go back, I will head directly to this hotel

<Content>It lives up to its Name I think this is one of the very best locations to be in. It is near the ebisu line and a mall that has many eateries. Thus although the hotel it self serves expensive food u are not limited to it although late into the night. The mall even has a macs and a supermarket. The rooms are great with the infamous westin bed!! gosh u can really enjoy a good sleep after all the shopping is done. there were simply no complains at all being there. everything was taken care off and the toilet was hahah like heaven. Toiletries are provided for. U can brew your own coffee as well!! Great Stay and Yes I will return again.

<Content>Blissfull stay Our stay at the Westin was uneventful and completely stress free. My spouse  I were arriving in Tokyo on separate flights landing in separate airpots and we were anxious about getting to the hotel in the middle of the night. But there was no need for us to worry, upon arrival at the hotel doors, our luggage was whisked away, check-in was fast and friendly and we are in our room in no time. Our room was on the top floor (21st) and we had panoramic view of Tokyo.The room itself was western-styled and bigger than a standard Japanese hotel room. The bathroom was elegant without being ostentatious. And as expected, everything in the room was clean and in-order.Service was top-class. Our calls to the service express office were promptly answered and the required service we wanted met. The business centre staff went out of their way and lent us their office computer to check emails when all the terminals were being used by other guests. The consierge was also very helpful in providing maps, timetables and other information.The location of the hotel is less hectic than say Shinjuku or Shibuya, but the with the train  subway station less than a 10 minute walk away one can easily travel to other parts of the city. The area around the hotel also has a lot of interesting places to see, the Ebisu Garden Place is across the street, restaurants abound and there are a number of hip places/shops like the Tokyo store of Maison Martin Margiela.

<Content>Wonderful stay at a beautiful hotel! I went to China and Japan with my boyfriend on business and he made all the travel arrangements - which is unusal for me because I'm somewhat of a research freak. BUT, this time I left it up to him (and his company) to choose where we stayed and I just went with it.On the last leg (and night) of a 10-day trip, we landed at the Westin Tokyo and we were pleasantly surprised!Check-in was very fast and my boyfriend upgraded us to a Club/Executive room which included free breakfast and happy hour for an extra $700 yen/night - totally worth it! I think we paid $350 total for our night stay.Back to the Club floor later, but let's start with the lobby! Really, really beautiful!! Lots of highly polished black marble, soaring ceilings and just very pleasing to the eye. There is a cafe/bakery, a formal restaurant and a restaurant/bar right off the loby - and that's all the farther we got past the room and the Club floor - so I can't speak of the other amenities in the hotel.Our room was 1608 and we had an amazing view of the city and the Tokyo Tower! It was cool during the day, but stunning at night! We got some great photos!! I only read a few reviews, but the one mentioning no view must have stayed on a very low floor or on another side of the building I never saw. BEAUTIFUL!The room was very large and had the super comfortable Heavenly Bed (king), a sofa and table, desk and another table and chair....very roomy. The bedding is white, crisp and soft - the pillows comfy. And the bathroom was gorgeous! Big bath tub, separate shower and a large vanity. Very, very nice!The bath products smelled great, there were lots of towels and they provided us with a travelers kit with a brush, toothbrush, q-tips, etc which you could take with you if you chose. Nice touch.We took advantage of the Club/Executive floor and headed up there after we checked in. There was a nice assortment of hard alcohol, beer, 2 red and 2 white wines, as well as juices and sodas. They also served really nice appetizers including salmon, chicken, duck and various other snacks. We sat and enjoyed several glasses of wine and the food, along with the beautiful view!!In the morning the breakfast consisted of the usual - eggs, sausage, fruits, pastries, cereals, juices, etc and they were quick to replenish plates.We did eat at the restaurant in the bar area - Brian got a chicken sandwich and I got the risotto (we had maxed out on Chinese and sushi!) and we thought it was fine. Not fabulous, but good. The prices were moderately high, but it's Tokyo and you're in a hotel!!! We expected to pay $15 for a chicken sandwich! There are several places nearby that we passed in the cab that looked very cute if you don't want to pay hotel prices.We felt the hotel was lovely and we were very happy with our stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this Westin to all of my friends.The only thing I'd say is that if you are looking for action, this really isn't the location for you. My boyfriend though he booked a hotel in Ginza, but this was miles away and would take 20+ minutes by cab to get there. We did take a cab to the Roppongi District and that main street was BUSY!!! Lots of clubs and restaurants to choose from. I think if we were to go again on our own (sans business,) we'd choose to stay in a more convenient area. If you are looking for a beautiful hotel in a quiet and upscale part of Tokyo, this is the place for you!Lisampls

<Content>A Good Westin Experience Having stayed at the Westin in Yebisu this past May during my first time in Tokyo, I was expecting the typeical goomy hotel room, limited on space and comfort. How wrong I was. Although in the traditional style rather than modern, the d茅cor was more than sufficient and the room enormous. With great views towards the gardens and a relatively commanding view of the city, it was all topped off with the great Heavenly bed and very large bathroom.One nice thought here was the toiletry bags with every possible thing in that you could need (apart from hair products and deodorant), so no need to worry about restrictions on carrying liquids on your flight if you are coming to the Westin here. You can also take these home.Arrival was superb and I was upgraded to an executive deal including free internet and free breakfast. Gym facilities were good and the bar in the reception area had a lot of charm compared with most other hotel lobby bars. Room service was great 鈥?order a beer and they will wheel in an actual bar with beer pump and serve you right there and then. Marvellous!The location of the Westin will not be ideal for everyone but is around 7 minute walk to Yebisu station and is right next to a shopping complex with all the stores you would need for last minute shopping, drugstore items or snacks and food.Not outstanding, but 4 stars for overall high quality and non-fussy delivery of the core Westin product.

<Content>Poor Service in Restaurant  Although it is extremely difficult to travel to theEbisu Westin, my family has historically visitedWestin about 1-2 times per month for 7-years with myJapanese wife. I am American, but we live in Yokohama.I also bring my customers to Westin for dinnermeetings. However, during my family's latest visit toWestin's Terrace Restaurant on 30 June 2007, wereceived completely unsatisfactory service. This isindicative of slipping quality: 1. Following the completion of hotelrenovations, the price of the buffet ('viking') hasescalated dramatically to 6800 JPY (a poor value forthe quality of food). It is more costly than most ofthe other Hotel buffet dinners in Tokyo or Yokohama(we have eaten at all of the Hotel buffets, so weknow). 2. On this evening, the Maitre-D/Hostess at TerraceRestaurant freely imposed an unwritten and unannounced90-minute ('Time Service') upon us because we werewalk-in guests. On this evening, the restaurant wasnearly empty when we arrived at 6:00pm, however, wewere rudely told that if we did not like thisTime-Service policy, then we should not sit down atall. We were not even done eating yet at 7:20, whenthe Hostess told us they needed our table for someoneelse with a reservation. Although we paid 6800 JPYeach for what was supposed to be a fine dinningexperience, their rude demand forced us to cram ourfood down quickly and leave. 3. We ordered an expensive glass of wine each withdinner, but the Waiter only poured about 2cm of winein the bottom of our medium-sized glasses. Wecomplained that we had paid for a 'glass of wine' andonly given a tiny portion. When we asked for a littlemore to make it worth the high price, the Waiter onlypoured a couple more drops of wine into one of ourglasses and then arrogantly and briskly walked awaywithout further comment. We do not understand whyHotel Waiters are so ketchi/stingy with wine pouringafter we paid expensive wine prices. In future, ifthey do that I will refuse to pay for the wine. 4. We had a closing drink (night-cap) in the LobbyBar. However, because of your Hotel's renovations, nowall the kitchen/cleaning staff parade back-and-forth(noisily talking and laughing) through the Bar gettingbetween the lounge cafe and the backkitchen...carrying huge trays and carts of dirtydishes above our heads, and destroying the romanticambiance. 5. Westin recently changed their Westin Way policies.Previously you provided 10% discounts on Dinner andRooms for WW-Members. It only marginally offset theirextremely expensive Costs (compared to comparablelocations elsewhere). The new Westin Way-Tokyo policydeletes all Discounts completely, and offers onlyVisitor Points every 100 JPY. It appears though thatthey have also raised the point totals needed toreceive any products/services from those accumulatedWW Points. Thusit seems they have tried to find aclever way to make more profit for themselves but toprice-gouge the customers on higher cost of goods likeRestaurants. We are going to stop using the Westin Waypoints program completely, and just try to accumulateSPG Points instead.They have one of the most elegant Lobbies andarchitectures of any hotel in Tokyo. However, whenconsidering Overall Poor Service from the TerraceRestaurant with its rude and unfriendly staff...the$80-$90 we each had to pay for dinner and a glass ofwine for what was supposed to be elegant dinning isunreasonably expensive. We felt cheated and abused byby the Hotel on this occasion because of this experience. If they do not fix these problems, we are going to stop coming totheir hotel in future.

<Content>Very comfortable hotel with great service I stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 1 week in March 2007. I was there for business and this hotel was chosen for me due to the proximity to the office.I had a very good experience at this hotel. Upon check-in, I was told that I had been given a very special room on the ladies floor. Apparently this is a new idea at the Westin and obviously just for women. All services including porter, room service, maid service, etc. are performed by women and no men are allowed on the floor. I was somewhat skeptical, but when I got to my room, I was very pleasantly surprised. Towards the end of the week, I moved to a regular room on a different floor so I can make an accurate comparison. My room on the ladies floor had the same furnishings and layout as a regular room but the extras included Bulgari bath products (wonderful smell!), a yoga mat and instructional DVD in the room, ionic hairdryer, female-specific toiletries like bath oil beads and salts, hair bands and clips, loofah, etc.Overall, both my rooms were very large by Tokyo standards, the Westin Heavenly bed can't be beat and the service is wonderful, very consistent with Tokyo in general.On a previous trip to Tokyo, I stayed at the New Otani in Akasaka and the only thing I liked more about that hotel was the location. The Westin Tokyo is in Ebisu which I personally didn't find too lively although there is some shopping and good restaurants and the Metro and JR lines are close by to take you to more happening parts of the city.My only complaint with the hotel is that the on-site restaurants are ridiculously priced. I chose to purchase the Executive package with my room which included 50% off internet charge, happy hour and appetizers and breakfast included on the Executive floor. On my last day I woke up too late to take advantage of my free breakfast and paid the regular price in the cafe downstairs. I think it was more than US$30 for 2 eggs, 2 sausage and 2 small pastries. Tea and juice were of couse extra as well. Its really too pricey for what you get.

<Content>American Style Opulent Luxury Hotel Stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 5 nights on business, because most other hotels were booked that period. If mahogany wood, black marble,golden handles and opulent ornaments are your style, the Westin may be a good choice. If you prefer modern simplicity, and expect value for money, you should look elsewhere.The good:- Big hotel with accordingly wide offer of facilities- Ebisu is a great place, and the Westin is the only major hotel- The rooms are very spacious for Tokyo standards- Big LCD TV, DVD-player, Fax and printer in the rooms - Very comfortable bed and pillows- Safe has an electrical outlet inside (great for iPods etc.)- Most of the distance to the station is covered - Mitsukoshi Department Store across the streetThe bad:- Maximizes turnover per customer (many services have quite a hefty fee - also see below)- No nice views over the city- Hotel is quite far away from the Station- Small bathtubThe ugly:- At a rack rate of 60.000 Yen, customers should not be charged separately for things you can take for granted, like In-room internet (1800 yen) and gym usage (1000 yen). The Westin is a nice hotel, especially for lovers of traditional American style luxury, but at this price point, I do expect more perfection. You can have similar luxury at half the price (e.g. Strings Hotel) or get more perfection at the same price (e.g. Grand Hyatt)

I had the pleasure of being within the Executive Club, which included a wonderful high-floor room (huge!); access to the executive club for breakfast and cocktails; and other amenities. Ebisu is a great area of Tokyo, as well. A big high-end, great restaurants, amazing access to transportation, within a few minutes of all central Tokyo sights.

<Content>Great hotel with great service I visited the Westin Tokyo on a business trip between 17 Feb and 20 Feb and had a fabulous stay. As an SPG Platinum member, I was upgraded to a large room on the Executive Club floor. This room was large and elegant even by American standards, with a marble bathroom, HD TV, chaise lounge, couch and desk. Unlike the previous reviewer, I found the service to be among the most polite and detailed of anyplace I've ever stayed. The turndown service provides freshly pressed pajamas and a kimono and the housecleaning folks are as close to perfect as I've seen. For example, the bathroom had an amenities kit with toothpaste, razor, etc. and every day the staff replaced every single item in the kit--and didn't just put it on the counter, they put it in the proper spot in the kit, zipped it closed and placed it in its spot on the counter. That's pretty amazing in my book. My only ding on this place was for room service. I ordered a green curry chicken that was almost inedible--three very fatty slices of chicken, totaling maybe 1.5 ounces, all for a mere $30. That aside, I would return in a heartbeat.

<Content>One of the Best Hotels in Tokyo This hotel is fantastic. Wonderful rooms. Nicely appointed and the largest I have ever had in Tokyo. You'll think you are in the US or Europe.The service here is top notch. Not only does everyone speak English, but you will receive that legendary Japanese style attention every time you meet a hotel employee.And the location is a probably the only nice western style locale in the urban jungle of Tokyo. Here you will find tree-lined streets... yes... trees in Tokyo... it was a breath of fresh air... literally! You will find a nice open space mall with shops and restaurants right across the street.The restaurants here are top notch. I highly recommend the Japanese steak house on the 22nd floor. The supreme beef is probably the best steak I have ever had... served up by a chef righ in front of you. Expect to pay $350 for a dinner for two with a bottle of wine. Well worth every yen.

<Content>Ebisu Is elegant and the Westin Tokyo is perfect John and Artemis Goldacre visited the Westin as part of our annual holiday, away from the perfect Island of Fuerteventura where we live, we wanted a hotel that had comfort and luxary with easy access to shops and as much entertainment we could muster, The Westin Tokyo provided all this with no disappointments.Plenty of high quality shops on hand within a five minute walk, alittle further takes you to the main JR Line station of Ebisu where access to the whole of tokyo is a short comfortable train ride away ,once you have worked out the subway it is cheap and efficient as taxis can be very expensive.A day at Disneyland Tokyo is a must as well as a visit to the Imperial Palace.Our room had a perfect view of mount FUJI on a clear day which it is said if you see Fuji in the morning you are destined for a lucky day and every day we felt lucky.The staff were great and accomodating a perfect place for your home from home in a big city.

It included great breakfast upstair at the club floor lounge or at the main restaurant. The evening cocktails were worth the cost of the upgrade to the club floor.

Hotel is a bit too expensive for my taste (around 300$ US/night),but when company is paying it's welcomed.Hotel is really good, rooms big with all you need and don't need inside, bathrooms are large with separated shower and tub, with all sorts of little goods for making the things better in the bathroom.I was on 12 and 13th floor, view was nice, panoramic, as the window is big. Hotel and hotel area is quiet, ideal for business travelers. Situated in Ebisu area, with shopping mall (nothing special for me) just across the street. JR train is around 500 meters from hotel (6-7 minutes walking).Everything is very nice, but if I had to give my money, I would choose another 5-star hotel, cheaper and similar in service...

<Content>Ebisu rocks! Westin Tokyo in Ebisu is great for US families. Rooms are large, plenty of amenities, and location is great -- Ebisu Center has most everything you might need right there, and it's quick to the Yamanote (sp?) circle line which takes you anywhere pretty quickly.Rooms are very good sized for Tokyo, with nice views to the Tokyo Tower. Great soundproofing, good bathrooms -- a nice place to relax after sightseeing in Tokyo.

<Content>Great Location I recently stayed at The Westin Tokyo while on vacation with my 12 year old son. The hotel staff was friendly, helpful, and for the most part spoke English. The concierge who each day helped us arrange for a tour or indicated which train we needed to take was especially helpful. It was raining during our stay; fortunately the hotel provided us with two umbrellas each morning on our way out of the door - which I though was a nice touch of hospitality.The Ebisu subway station is a short 10 minute walk from the hotel (you can ride the moving walkways for at least half of the distance). The hotel is conveniently located on the west side of Tokyo and you are no more than 15 minutes away (by subway) from Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, Roppongi, Ginza, or Tokyo station. Lucky for us Yebisu Gardens (adjacent to the hotel) shows English language films on a giant outdoor screen during July and August (last night we watched Chicago) and best of all it is free of charge. The room was clean, well maintained, and comfortable. The only not-so positive comment I have is that the restaurants in the hotel are a bit on the expensive side (relatively speaking of course, since we are in Tokyo). I don鈥檛 usually stay at the Westin when in Tokyo on business but given the opportunity to stay here again while on vacation 鈥?I would do so without hesitation.

<Content>Very Good Stay at Westin Tokyo We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Westin Tokyo  we were very pleased with the service, location  our room. This was a vacation trip  we used Starwood points for the entire stay so expected less then luxe accomodations. We were pleasantly surprised with our room (826) which appeared to be oversized  had a seating area. The hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to the Ebisu Metro/Train station - leaving the hotel from the B1 level you can reach the station without going outside. There are many restaurants in the Garden complex as well as the surrounding neighborhood. The Concierge in the Business Center was quite helpful  printed maps when we asked how to get to specific locations.Our personal experience at the Westin Tokyo was a good one.

<Content>A Good Business Hotel Stayed for a total of a week and a half in March.This was the second time staying at the Westin Tokyo. I've stayed at a couple of other hotels in Tokyo and still prefer this one over some of the others. Nothing beats the Heavenly Beds at the Westin chains and this one is just like all the others. They had a choice of 2 different types of pillows so you can sleep in comfort. In addition, the staff was very helpful. The concierge will be happy to supply you with maps and directions to wherever you need to go. They were also helpful in writing questions like Can you recommend a good sake? in Japanese so that I can just take it to the department store of my choosing.I only had one negative experience during this trip but it was rectified so in the end I was happy. While the rate is really good (I think it's about US$10 for a 7-day access card), access is only available in the lobby and unfortunately for my laptop was unrealiable. So unrealiable that I had to complain. The first time I complained, they did not offer me any other option but the second time I complained, the concierge offered to give me access to the wireless access on the club room floor for no additional charge. On the club room floor I had no problems accessing the internet. Upon check-out, they had even removed the initial 7-day access card fee. In terms of location, it is close to the Ebisu station on the JR line and Hibiya line. It was very convenient for me both for my business meetings and personal shopping (in Shibuya, Harajuku, and Shinjuku).For those traveling with a JR railway pass that you buy before you go to Japan (a good deal if you're going to other cities in Japan), you should also note that the JR railway pass is good for the JR 'subway' line in Tokyo. You just have to show your pass to the attendant. In comparison, I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt and the Cerulean Tower. I probably prefer the Grand Hyatt over the Westin but it does generally cost more. Plus, I'm not a fan of the Roppongi area. As for the Cerulean Tower, it was a good hotel as well but the service level (while still exceptional over North American hotels) was below both of the other hotels. The Westin is a great deal and is in a great area of Tokyo.

<Content>Poor Service / Poor Location My friends and I stayed here for 4 nights and we had nothing but trouble. Not 5-star service at all. The rooms were too expensive for the poor service we had. Other friends stayed in a better hotel and they got what they paid for. The Westin is far from the hot spots and tourist sights. The walk to the train station was far. The taxi fares add up. You can find a better hotel in the same price range closer to everything. The breakfast and lunch buffets were like cafeteria food. It's not a dump by any means but it is not hip and modern like you would imagine in Tokyo. There are better places so keep searching!

<Content>Great rooms and excellent service Based on negative reviews from several travellers I was a bit apprehensive about staying at this hotel. However, I had a wonderful stay and was quite impressed by the excellent service. I saw no difference in the treatment of Japanese vs non-Japanese guests by the hotel staff. Indeed, staff were always attentive and had a good command of English. Concierge services were excellent. Breakfast buffet was OK and reasonably priced. Hotel restaurants were great (particularly the Teppanyaki restaurant on the 22nd floor), although a bit overpriced, but that is the norm in hotel restaurants in Japan. Room was huge by Japanese standards with great beds (heavenly beds) and very good views. Bathroom was also huge, with separate shower/bathtub facilities; good water pressure in the shower. I am not a fan of the hotel's French faux-European decoration, but I tended to overlook it, since the hotel is excellently maintained. Location is not as central as other hotels in Marounouchi, but it is very convenient to such areas as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Omotesando, Roppongi and Shinagawa (via the subway or the JR Yamanote line). Hotel is connected by underground passages via the Yebisu Garden Place to the Ebisu station (about 10 minutes away), so you can avoid bad weather conditions. Also, the Yebisu Garden Place is a very nice area with a good department store (Mitsukoshi) and a large choice of restaurants. Overall, a great hotel with excellent service.

<Content>poor customer service If you want great customer service and to be treated the same as any other guest than DO NOT STAY AT THE WESTIN! We were treated poorly compared to the JAPANESE customers. It was a terrible experience. Other reviews stated this and we assumed that the others were just being ugly americans but they were not. It was true. The Grand Hyatt was better as we changed hotels after 3 nights in the Westin. It is also out of the way from anything interesting to see. I would never stay in such a place again. Westin USA should look into this poor treatment of foreign customers by the Japanese. It was awful.

<Content>Decent if uninspired five-star hotel Good things: large room, comfortably furnished and modern. General ambience is impressive - very much a five-star establishment. Service is professional. Executive lounge is excellent (including free breakfast and evening drinks / hors-d`oeuvres). Good choice of restaurants (but pretty expensive).Debatable: Location. Very handy for the pleasant Ebisu Garden Palace area, with shops and restaurants; only an easy ten minute walk, mainly along moving walkways, to Ebisu station. Yet not actually in one of the main areas that most visitors to Tokyo would want to see.Very frustrating: no swimming pool.

<Content>Homeless In Tokyo My husband and I were treated poorly by the staff of this hotel. We were locked out of our room in the middle of the night and were not allowed to enter our room for more than 2 hours until the staff figured out that they had made a grave error. We have never been treated like that by any staff in any hotel in Europe and North America. Beware of what you are getting yourself into if you choose this hotel. If anything goes wrong then it will be assumed that it has somehow happened because of you. We will not return to this hotel when we come back to TOKYO next spring. It was more expensive than other 5-star hotels and hardly worth it. We are STARWOOD PREFERRED CUSTOMERS and were shocked by this treatment. It was truly a poor, poor experience in a very foreign land. As far as hotel ammentities are concerned they were adequate but far from 5-star hotels we have stayed in before. The restaurant food was very low quality. It was also quite far from most sights in Tokyo. Do not stay here....

<Content>3-star service!! My two friends and I stayed here for 6 nights in NOV. '05 and we had some pretty bad experiences. We arrived to the hotel at 3am after a night out and all of our key cards were cancelled and when we went to the desk we were treated as if we were criminals. Ultimately they figured out that when we checked in that the desk staff had entered the wrong check-out date and it was their mistake. We had to wait until after 5:30 am for them to figure this out. The general manager said that we should have been allowed to enter our room and that it should have been taken care of during the day. The NAZI desk staff would not budge as we were foreigners. I live in JAPAN and speak Japanese so I was following the conversations. It would have been handled differently had the guests been Japanese. This is the down side of being a foreigner in Japan sometimes but I would have expected more from the WESTIN HOTEL. We lost a day of our trip to TOKYO because of this. We splept through a tour we had planned and we were unable to re-book it. We were given many sorry's and many deep bows and were given one night for free but it soured our hotel experience. Tokyo was AWESOME so I suggest you look for another hotel to fully appreciate this GREAT city!! The desk supervisor arranged reservations for my two friends in the TEPPAN YAKI STEAK HOUSE on the 22nd floor for their last night in TOKYO and when they arrived they had to wait 20 minutes to be told that it would have to take 1 MORE HOUR for them to get a table because they lost the reservation!! What kind of service is that? They offered to send them out of the hotel to another place but they waited and when they got the check they were charged a table charge and my friend refused to pay it. The next morning I had to call the hotel's general manager and the general manager in the KYOTO WESTIN who will be the new GM in TOKYO soon to get that dinner taken off of their total bill. That meal should have been complimentary to begin with. This would most likely not happen in other credible 5-star hotels. There are better hotels closer to the action than the WESTIN. KEEP SEARCHING! By the way, we were allowed to eat the lunch buffet as a result of us sleeping through breakfast the day we were locked out and the food was terrible. The breakfast was never great either. The executive room on the 17th floor was fairly crowded and tables were often full of dirty dishes and guests had to stand around to wait for tables to be cleared. After the one free night and free dinner it was not worth 370,000 yen for 6 nights! LOOK FOR BETTER!!

<Content>Why bother? I AGREE!! Well, I do not know how this hotel could possibly be the best in Tokyo as another reviewer put it. His last line about getting the most for your money says it right there. If you want something cheap that is posing as something else then stay here. The Park Hyatt or Grand Hyatt are both much better as well as better located. The 4 Season's is also better. The staff was rude to us on a few occasions. They were definitely not all 5-star trained. The location was not convenient at all. The breakfast and lunch buffets were awful. Well, more like airplane food in business class as it looked good and was semi-edible. I do not understand the buffet mentality at a 5-star hotel. The food is hardly fresh. This is just a dressed up holiday inn and nothing more. Do not even consider it.

<Content>arguably the best hotel in Tokyo People that don't know anything about Tokyo can't appreciate that the Westin Tokyo is in probably the best location anywhere in the city. Along the Yamanote line, sandwiched between Daikanyama, Shibuya Hiroo, Aoyama and the rest. A short trip on Hibiya Line to Ginza, a short cab to Omotesando and all the great places to shop, lazz around or just plop down at a Ebisu cafe and watch the people, the location is unrivaled period.As far as the hotel goes, you're right, it's not super Japanesey, but if that's what you want go to Kyoto. It's sophisticated, comfortable, and exudes class. Service is typical Japanese so the highest standards anywhere in the world.Bottom line the best Hotel in Tokyo for the money.Ryan Hart

<Content>why bother. baffled at the comments by other users of this hotel. there is nothing even slightly japanese about this hotel. actaually it is far more faux european. the bathromms are nor marble as stated in another review, they are dusty rose color ceramic tile accented with black granite counter tops. the furniture is not beidermeier but rather of similar design made of veneer. all inlay and wood surfaces are made or a similar product that is a photographic polymer sheeting. it all adds to the feel of elegance with a fraction of the cost. all paintings and portraiture vague european reproduction. cheap and out of place productions at best.comfortable beds and large bathrooms suitable for families. very short internet cords present a number of poblems. true heavenly beds.very good sleep. ice down the hall. fast service and very thourough housekeeping. shops, bank postal office,restaurants all contained in this complex as well as the super pretionious joel roubichon restaurant. long haul to the metro station with an even longer haul to anyplace else on the tourist side of things. this hotel is geared to the business man working in the local area, event planners(weddings galore)or the north american tourist.though there is nthing wrongwith this hotel, language presented a problem as did wrong directons. though many users have enjoyed it, i would never stay here again. older places such as the imperial, the new otani(old builing, not tower) or the okura are far better bets. or spend the money and just stay at the park hyatt or brand new grand hyatt in roppongi hills. the westin is a suckers bet for those that want no reminder that they are actually in japan. if that's the case, why go?

<Content>We had a lovely stay!! My husband, daughter and I recently stayed here for three nights. We paid just a tiny bit extra to stay on the executive club level. Let me tell you, the service we received was wonderful! We had tons of questions (how do we get here, what do you recommend) and they even looked up a special store to which we wanted to take our daughter. The staff were attentive, attentive, attentive!! My husband and daughter enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the club each morning and we all loved going in the evenings where they treated my daugther as specially as the rest of the guests. You could have pretty much whatever cocktail you wished (fairly simple though--martinis, etc.) or lovely glasses of wine to have with a nice light appetizer/snack buffet.The rooms were really great--a nice oasis after a hot and busy day of sighseeing. Rooms included slippers, heavy terry robes or lightweight cotton robes--take your pick, and complimentary bottles of water. The bathroom is as great as everyone describes. You have to close your eyes and forget about the prices when ordering room service (we did, after arriving very late on our first evening--this is Tokyo after all) but the food was great and hot. We had a wonderful meal in the Chinese restaurant one night. The hotel is close to two very nice shopping centers (though they are so close together that they are really just one). We enjoyed browsing and the centers included many, many food choices! (The little french bakery right near the hotel in the underground is TO DIE FOR!) I've read some complaints about the walk to the subway but we never minded it as the area is lovely. The subway is easy to use and a great way to get around town. A beautiful hotel in a wonderful location that just added to our excellent trip!

<Content>Amazing Hotel The Westin Tokyo was an amazing place to stay. I can't comment on value because I traded my Starwood points for a 3 night stay here in April. The room was large and elegantly appointed. The bathroom was the largest we had seen in a Japanese room. Larger than most hotels in the US as well. There was a tub and also a full walk in shower with full pressure showerheads. The lobby is just stunning in all black marble, brass and wood trim. The hotel staff was perfect in every way. It was almost like we were not in Japan at all. We always were greeted by an assistant who spoke perfect English. All of the door staff greeted us with a Hello or Good Morning. They then shifted to greet the group behind us in Japanese customary style. The highest compliment I can give is when a hotel staff person remembers you days later. We were met by several Japanese friends who spoke little english. The hotel concierge acted as interperter for us to plan our day. Now this was 15 minutes of conversation at 10AM, not a slow time of day at a hotel. She never looked as she wanted to get to something else to do and made sure we both knew the plan. When we were checking out, she came up to us and asked how our day went and was it to our liking. The walk back and forth to the JR line (approx 15 minutes) became a bit tedious after 3 days and the food locations tend to close a bit early for us. However, those were the only things I could fault the hotel about.
