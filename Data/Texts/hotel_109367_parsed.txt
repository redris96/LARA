<Content>Excellent Hotel I recently returned from a business trip to Dallas. My stay at this hotel could not have been better. Spacious, clean rooms (complete with chocolates on your pillow every night), an extremely friendly staff, and a location convenient to downtown. Plus, a free shuttle brings you anywhere you want to go AND picks you up (within a few mile radius). If I go back to Dallas, I will most definitely stay at this hotel again!! Thanks :)

<Content>Excellent stay The Marriott Suites is an excellent choice if visiting the Dallas area for three main reasons. 1) Free shuttle service: parking can be expensive and they will drive you and pick you up from anywhere in a 5 mile radius. 2) Great rooms: the extra living room space and color palate really increased the enjoyability factor of our stay. 3) Free breakfast: make sure you book your room with a free breakfast. Not only was it delicious but the service was extravagant. Please note that internet does not come for free at the Marriott but that there is a business center with a printer attached as well.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, great experience My wife, 2 year old son and I arrived after a 10 hour drive from St Louis. First word of advice, get off the freeway one exit sooner then your NAV system says :). Check in was a breeze. We had a King suite room which was fantastic with private TV, dressing areas, warm comfy bed and amazing bedding. Our 2 year old loved the view of the city from the room. Due to our late arrival, we did not have any dinner, but the resturant stayed open for us which was a pleasent surprise since we did not want to get in the car again to drive for a meal. We utilitzed the swimming pool and hot tub onsite and that was refreshing. This is a 4 star hotel, but the size and comfort of the room are 5 star quality. If in Dallas again, this would be our 1st choice for where to stay.

<Content>Wonderful Marriott! With the Marriott name, you know you are going to get your money's worth and more. This Marriott did not disappoint. Even with a room facing the interstate, I had a very peaceful sleep. Since the room was a suite, this made for any easier working session with my fellow travelers. We piled into one room and knocked out all the details of several projects. The rooms are spacious, the beds are heavenly, and the bathroom is very clean. The bar manager was very helpful in providing us dinner suggestions and even made our reservations. A hotel shuttle will take you where you need to go within a 15 minute radius of the hotel, and come back and pick you up...free of charge. The lobby and bar area have a trendy feel but not over the top. The food...always a good menu and the servers are always friendly. You can't go wrong with this Marriott.

<Content>Go for the Bed, Stay for the Service We selected this Marriott's for our first trip to Dallas based upon your Tripadvisor .com feedback. A main reason that we stay at any hotel is to sleep (more or less), so the mattress and pillows etc are our top priority. Lousy sleep, lousy start to the next day. The new (we assume) Revive bedding that Marriott features in some/all of these rooms is absolutely outstanding!! Soft but supportive, really comfortable. Select the extra feather pillows option too. Pillow talk aside, the room floorplan (Executive Suite) was very well designed; spacious and efficient. We used the AAA discount, which allowed us a suite deal. We requested a high floor in our reservation and got it. Only suggestion would be to specify the southwest side of the building to minimize or eliminate freeway noise. On the 10th floor it wasn't an issue, but down low could get noisy due to the concrete freeways in Dallas. Zero noise from adjoining rooms. HVAC kept the room pleasant, quietly. Service was outstanding, with everyone greeting us pleasantly, excellent restaurant/bar service, and efficient housekeeping. They served a full menu in the bar after the restaurant closed, which was perfect for us due to our long days away from the hotel. The food was consistently good (great cheeseburgers). The elektronica music playing in the lobby/restaurant was irritating, so we left a comment about that in one of the survey cards. Plenty of parking, small sundries store. They charge for broadband, which seems wrong these days, but we needed a secure connection, which rules out the local Starbucks. Overall, this hotel worked hard to make our stay pleasant and to assure our consideration should we be back in that part of Texas.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel! I stayed here on business in early March, 2008. Great room at a great rate! I love the location and access. The room was just the right size.I found the staff to be very friendly and on the ball. I had several packages shipped to me before arrival, which always concerns me, but they showed up in great shape and the staff informed me right at check-in that the packages had arrived.I highly recommend Marriott Suites!

<Content>Nice Marriott I do have to say that I stayed at the Marriott Suites mainly because that is what our agency booked for us, and most likely because a couple of our other favorites were completely booked.Pros:This hotel was immaculate. There were four elevators that got me up to the 8th floor in a matter of seconds. Also, the staff was very helpful: I called the front desk at around 3:30 AM for a packet of regular coffee and got it in about 3 minutes.Cons:The pillows, probably in an effort to be fashionable, were squares, and smaller than a standard pillow. They were quite comfortable, but only when my head was completely on it, which was a challenge. Also, the towels are similar to those you'd find at a Quality Inn or some other lower level hotel -- definitely not what I'd expect to see when paying over $200 a night.

<Content>outstanding! We booked a training event at the property. What a GREAT property. Staff were attentive and responsive, rooms were HEAVENLY a!nd the food was great. Drinks in the bar are pricey. And they will take you down to the West End where there is a great bunch of restaurants.Overall, wonderful! Would be unbelievable if the internet was not soo pricey

<Content>Great Service We stayed 5 nights when attending the NSDC conference. The conference was held at the Hilton Anatole but after reading reviews and positive past Marriott experiences we decided on the Market Suites. The rooms were nice and clean. I did not care for the bathroom layout, but that was minor. Please note there is nothing in walking distance but there is a complimentary shuttle.The service was superb. The front desk was very helpful and friendly. The restaurant servers were great. The shuttle driver Johnny was the best. He was informative, friendly and went above and beyond. He had great suggestions for restaurants and when he drove us to a restaurant he walked us in, talked to a manager and made sure we had the next available table!

<Content>Wow, Wow, Comfie, Comfie !!!!! I was apprehensive about the hotel but it turned out to be a WONDERFUL hotel. The decor was very inviting, the staff was super and tended to every request and need...and I am a very, very picky person. Additionally, the rooms gave space and breathing room because of the size, privacy and furniture placement.Food in the hotel was great too...from room service (try the maple peppered bacon...yum, yum!!!).The only two drawbacks...no views of the city and parking...

<Content>Marriott safe bet for comfortable stay We stayed 4 nights at Marriott Suites and had booked the Romance package. Good value for money and room was fine plenty of room for just the two of us. We should have been given vouchers for breakfast but did not find out until after first day but quickly sorted by hotel. Staff were efficient and friendly. Would benefit by upgrading TV/Hi Fi but minor point. Also used the Hotel shuttle in the evenings to go out to eat which was great as we could enjoy a drink. Johnny Ray was our driver every night and just trust his recommendations, he took us to some great places at different costs and ensured we either jumped the queues or got complimentary appetisers/desserts!! Downtown was only 5 - 10 minutes drive and we found parking during the day easy to find and cheap. We also stayed for a night later in the week at Embassy Suites Love Field and Rennaissance which just confirmed what good value the Marriott Suites was, best of the lot.

<Content>Fine stay at the Marriott Suites The Marriott Suites is a perfectly fine hotel in a convenient location. The set-up of the suite, which includes a seating area and desk seperate from the bedroom, is excellent for business stays. The hotel is well-decorated and the staff is very professional. The only downside, as other reviewers have noted, is that there is nothing (restaurants, stores, etc.) within walking or short driving distance of the hotel (you generally have to get on the freeway to get anywhere). As Dallas traffic is terrible, this is a bit of a downside. I might consider staying here if returning but would likely check out the many hotels nearby.

<Content>Marriott Dallas is a Solid Choice This hotel is a solid, high-end place. The room is a very spacious suite of two rooms with a lot of comfortable space and furniture to relax. Room service was fast and good -- only drawback is that it ends at 11:00 PM. My highest marks go to hotels with some type of 24 hour food service.The location is a bit odd -- there is no place accessible via walking. This is a car accessible place only -- it is in a highway corridor with a number of other very large hotels. However, the drive to the heart of downtown was less than 10 minutes -- very convenient.The room was VERY clean and orderly. The lobby and restaurant were simple and nice.The room would be excellent for two friends traveling together or for a couple, as one person could go to bed, with the other watching TV or reading in the other room. Nice set-up.

<Content>TripAdvisor does not steer you wrong! Great Hotel! This Marriott hotel is rated at a class 4 hotel, but it is really a 5 or 6 class rating. The hotel does not give itself enough credit. As a silver elite Marriott member this hotel was very impressive. I chose this hotel because of the reviews I read on Trip Advisor and it did not disappoint. Only a few minutes from the West End (cobble stone, historic, restaurant area) by car. This hotel also offers a free shuttle service to the airport, West End  Uptown. Also check out the Uptown area, a more trendy area with more bars,  restaurants. Great location.Rooms are suites with a set of French doors separating the bedroom from sitting room. Great room  service for the price. Mini kitchen area, sink, refrigerator,  coffee maker.My only compliant was the business center did not provide computer Internet service for free. Although hotel is wired for wireless which is free in public areas, I just did not have my lap top with me.

<Content>Very nice, impressed I stayed here for pleasure one weekend in March, and selected the hotel for its location. I've stayed at plenty of Marriotts and wasn't expecing much from this one since it is not a 4 star property. I was really surprized however that this hotel was as nice as other Marriotts and the rooms were bigger! The suite style with a sitting area seperate from the bedroom was very nice. I liked this place and would stay there again for pleasure in a heartbeat. Excellent location close to down town and good food. The staff was also very friendly.

<Content>Wow...I am a Marriott follower now. My wife and I visited Dallas for a friend's grand opening of a restaurant in uptown... The Fish. We travel somewhat frequently and usually go to non-chain hotels to get a unique experience from the city we are visiting. Since this trip was last minute trip, I hesitantly picked Marriott Market Center for its location and price. Well...I will now look for a Marriott hotel anywhere I go because of our experience at this hotel. The location was a short drive to most anywhere we went The hotel's decor was modern yet warm and cozy. The facilities were first rate from the restaurant to the pool to the room. Our suite with the king size bed was really amazing for the money. The best thing, however, was the service from EVERYONE - front desk  restaurant personnel, shuttle driver Johnny, and anyone else I forgot. Everything was above expectations... anytime we visit Dallas, it will be the Marriott Market Center.

<Content>Just what we needed We stayed one night in Dallas and found that the Marriott Suites was a great choice! It is located right off the freeway and is convenient to downtown Dallas. We went to the Faith Hill and Tim McGraw concert in the American Airlines Arena and the hotel was only a 5 minute drive...very convenient!! The hotel lobby was decorated very modern and colorful! There is a restaurant and bar located in the hotel...we didn't eat there because we were in a hurry to get to the concert, but it smelled really good! The front desk employees were very friendly, easy check-in and check-out. The hotel room was very spacious! The bedroom was separated by french doors from the living room. The room had a mini fridge, coffee maker, and bar sink (but no mini bar supplies...just bottles of water). We did not spend much time at the hotel, but we slept very well and woke up to a paper outside our door! The bed was very comfortable and it was a quite room (we faced the backside of the building and had a night view of Dallas lights, the front faces the freeway)! It was clean as well!! There is no fee to park your vehicle, but there are signs posted everywhere to lock your car and hide your valuables. It did not seem like it was located in a shady area, but I guess it was just a reminder to take precaution. We would stay at this hotel in the future!

<Content>Stolen Identity My family and I recently stayed at a Marriott hotel. Although nice, I strongly urge that they furthur their budget in the security department. We stayed at Marriott Suites 2493 N. Stemmons Freeway Dallas,Tx 75207.Friday June 1  2, 2007. We had been at the hospital since Thursday evening with my brother in ICU. Exausted, with no sleep, and being constantly harrased by the homeless, and no where to go, and our home over an hour away, I reserved a room Friday night for 2 nights. Thinking this was a quality hotel, I was willing to pay for a more expensive hotel for the guality and safety that I thought they offered. But while we slept that Friday night, someone came into our room and stole mine and my mothers purses. Everything I practically owned was in that purse, drivers license, social security numbers and cards, bank cards, credit cards, medical cards...$200.00 worth of mp3 players. My mothers debit/credit card. My husband cancelled our bank card and credit cards that day. My dad cancelled theirs, but has continued to get reports of continued use of their card. They are now officailly, flat broke. We called the police,they made a report, but there are no leads. We filed a complaint to the claims department, in which we were told that the hotel had not filed a claim yet. The claims department sayed they would call us back , and they haven't. This should not have ever happened. We are extremly upset and highly disappointed in this hotel, and how this has been handled so far. We still have not been offered any compensation in any way. God forbid that this could have been someones child stolen out of the room, and they have to file it with the claims department. I pray this NEVER happens to anyone!!

<Content>Highly Recommended I stay in Dallas a few nights every month on business. I have stayed at most of the name-brand hotels in the city (Marriott, Hilton/Doubletree, Hyatt, etc.) and the Marriott Suites at Market Center is my favorite. It is reasonably priced and the rooms are clean, updated and comfortable. You get a suite for the price of a regular room at most comparable places. I especially liked the comfortable bed and the fact that the shades block almost all outside light. Room service overall is very good - food was good if not spectacular, but breakfast came on time and service was very friendly. In fact, service was very friendly from the front desk, housekeeping staff and everyone else I encountered. Plenty of free parking in the outside lot, and the location is very good. I highly recommend this hotel to business travelers looking for a very spacious, clean, comfortable, convenient hotel in the $225 range. The rates on the weekend (I haver seen $129 advertised) are a real bargain.
