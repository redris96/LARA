<Content>Highly recommended I stayed at the Hotel Mayflower from Dec 11-14 and would recommend it to other travelers. The reception is very friendly and helpful. I forgot to call on the day of arrival to let them know that I would be arriving very late. When I reached around midnight, they have kept the room for me. The room is comfortable and clean. When they realized that there was no phone in my room, it was resolved immediately. The breakfast is simple but more than sufficient. However, for light sleepers, I would suggest requesting for a room further along the corridor. My room was on the first floor just next to the stairs. It can be quite noisy in the morning when other guests walked down to breakfast.

<Content>Classic rooms with a friendly staff, great breakfast I had a stay for several weeks at the Mayflower. Cost and location were my deciding factors. My first room was overlooking Bush street. LOTS of sun, light, people watching - I loved it. I was not dissapointed and was pleasantly surprised with the easy feel of the place.Regarding the bathrooms (and kitchens) - they are old but the owners seem to be retaining a lot of the original feel of the original features. There are original porcelain floor and wall tiles and design details in many instances from many many years ago. When they have had to cut into a wall to modernize, I noticed someone paid a lot of attention to carefully matching modern tiles and grout such that the average person may not notice. In my opinion, this kind of bathroom is more interesting than what you would find in any modern hotel. I like to see the patina of wear and appreciate the fine craftsmanship that set all those little porcelain tiles so many years ago. Cleanliness was not an issue.I found the rooms very clean and of good size. The street side room became quite an issue by the third day as at night the street noise started to bug me. (they have to retain the old originial windows on the facade) On the third night I requested a quieter room which they showed me to in the back of the hotel. It was great - until they started remodeling the room next door. No matter - they offered to change my room again but I declined as I was out in the city during most the day. Otherwise this room near the back was very quiet at night. Someone made homemade goodies for breakfast too. In addition the the regular cereal, bread and such, cookies appeared some days and breakfast cakes on others. Gotta try the cinnimon bread toast with butter - yum. The clientele in the morning was a nice mix of Americans, some foreign travellers, and some retired folks. There was a small kitchen with mirowave  refrigerator in my room. It had minimal items to make lunch and a simple supper. There is a great market right downstairs and to the left with groceries and some prepared items. A medditerranean flair to the food and they stocked Champagne too!

<Content>Great Weekend My spouse and I stayed at The Mayflower last weekend on the recommendation of a friend. Check in was a breeze. When we got to our 6th floor room, which was on the sunny side of the building, it was quite warm. We called the desk to see what could be done. No problem...the manager (who is also the owner's daughter) met us on the 6th floor, and escorted us to a much more comfortable room on the opposite side of the building. Personal service like this is quite rare these days. The rest of the weekend was comparable, with consistently above expectations service. Our room was spotless, comfortable and quiet. We would recommend The Mayflower to all travelers.

<Content>Better than expected stay We arrived before noon and they were able to check us in early as the rooms were ready. (I need to add that the check-out time is 1pm,not the usual 11am) The location, supermarket and spacious room (with microwave and fridge) was a good bargain. We had no trouble with the area's security and felt safe in the neighbourhood at night.Breakfast was good. We were not expecting much from free continental breakfast - maybe some juice, toasted bread/bagels and coffee, but the spread was a nice surprise, with cakes, cereals, etc.The hotel comes with a caged lift and it gives us a quaint, homely feel to this hotel. This is a family-run hotel and they have certainly made my stay homely!

<Content>Great location and great hotel The Hotel Mayflower is perfectly situated in an area of San Francisco that is close to many of the best tourist attractions--Union Square, Moscone Center, Nob Hill, Fishermans Wharf, Chinatown, and Japantown. We actually walked to all these places, and the walks were both invigorating and surprisingly short. Take the Hyde Street cable car back from Fishermans Wharf to the hotel. It drops you off only two blocks away at Powell  Bush.Service at the hotel was excellent. The owners are very friendly and accommodating. The room was certainly big enough and had THREE large closets. Yes, the rooms smell a bit musty, but there's no mold. And the inner rooms shelter you quite a bit from the street noise. As for the garage...the entrance is tight and getting into it should be done from a traffic lane, NOT from the parking area right in front of the hotel. Your car should be no bigger than a Toyota Matrix or Pontiac Vibe--otherwise it will scrape against the walls of the entrance. Once inside the garage, however, you have plenty of maneuvering room. And there are In  Out privileges!

<Content>nice room  I've been there for 4 nights; I was on my own.The experience has been definetively positive. Nice and very large room  bath;Clean;wi-fi + 4 PCs connected to the internet, to be used for free;breakfast is ok;the position is very convenient, as you have union square, chinatown and the cable car, all at a walking distance.-The neighborhoods are ok, even during night.The staff is friendly.Cons-The building shows its age in some things (old lift, windows). Avoid however the area of Tenderloin, at about 10 mins walking from the hotel (the area is between Market St and Larkin St to the south, Geary St and Larkin St to the northwest), as you will find there many beggers and many not-so-nice faces :-)

<Content>Great atmosphere Hotel Mayflower was a great choice for budget accom. right in downtown San Francisco. We stayed for 4 nights, the reception was really friendly and welcoming, the decor very original, a very good first impression.Our room was large and spacious, with kitchenette, and very clean. Breakfast in dining room was average, the owner went to some trouble to source some ingredients to deal with allergy.The hotel has been in the same family since it was built, and there is a real sense of pride. It is an old hotel, and hasn't had much renovation, but that only added to its charm.Would definately recommend this place.

<Content>UNBELIEVABLE towels After reading some reviews of the Mayflower we decided to book ourselves in and save some money (we had originally contacted the Hol Inn Fishermans Wharf about staying there) - we ended up paying just over half the amount of the Hol Inn and glad in our hotel choice!The Mayflower is located just a few blocks from Union Square (5 minute walk) so is ideally situated to all the action. Rooms are superb, with a good sized main area, a small kitchen, and a nicely proportioned bathroom. We didnt really use the kitchen apart from the fridge to keep drinks cool, but if you were staying here and wanted to cook yourself, you would have no problems there!The free internet access is great and the free continental breakfast was a nice touch - sets you up for the dayThe thing that will live in my mind forever about this hotel though will be the towels! I have never smelt better towels! I (along with the other 3 members of our party) actually looked forward to having showers so we could get to use the fresh towels that had been laid out - we should have swiped some of the fabric conditioner and brought it home with us!I would have no hesitation in staying here again, as the location is good, the staff extremely friendly and helpful, and most importantly, the price is very very good value!

<Content>A San Francisco Treasure Hotel Mayflower is a San Francisco treasure. It is comfortable, affordable, clean, very conveniently located, and with outstanding customer service. I extended my stay from a couple of nights to a couple of months for business purposes, and loved the spacious room (brand-new mattresses), fully equipped kitchenette, spotless bathroom and professional and friendly staff. This historic hotel is perfect for both business (free internet access and separate study on first floor mezzanine) and pleasure, with Union Square shopping, theaters, restaurants and public transport within short walking distance. The complimentary breakfast is served in a beautiful airy dining room, where I felt equally welcome to read the newspaper alone or chat with the other guests. I would especially recommend the Mayflower to travellers from abroad (like myself) who wish to have convenient access to everything this city has to offer and to stay in a hotel that reflects the history of the city while providing the comforts of today. This is a family owned hotel, evident from the careful maintenance of the building (new wiring, plumbing, windows and fresh paint when I was there). It is also evident from the consideration they show their guests. They accommodated any request and did everything they could to make my stay there successful and pleasurable. I have visited the city repeatedly over the past twenty years, and this is by far my favourite place to stay.

<Content>Quaint but familiar... I spent one night at this hotel in Oct 2006 and when I was returning to SF last month called to make reservations.No single or standard rooms were available so I was only able to get a room with a queen size bed for about 125.00 plus taxes a night.I arrived at the hotel around 1:45pm although check-in was at 3:00pm. The check-in process was quick and easy and I was able to leave my bag in the luggage room while I went to get something to eat.When I returned a few hours later, the room was ready and I was pleased. The room was clean and bright, had a kitchenette with a fridge ( which I made use of ), a microwave, glasses, mugs , cereal bowls and cutlery. The bathroom, although old, was clean, with sweet -smelling towels and fresh toiletries.During my stay I partook of the continental breakfast which consisted of orange juice, tea and coffee,butter, peanut butter, apple sauce, apples, cake, and a choice of multi-grain bread or white bread. It was self-service so you could eat as much or as little as you wanted. The breakfast was filling and a great money saver.The location is within walking distance to shopping, restaurants,and the cable cars.There is also a coin laundry nearby and a food mart next door. There was internet access in the room I stayed in as well as 3 computers for guests use, in the upstairs lobby area.The staff is friendly and helpful without being intrusive. Overall I enjoyed staying in the Mayflower Hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Price! Great Staff too! At first I was afraid this would be close to the tenderloin district. It's Nowhere close to tenderloin... it's far far away. It's on a safe street. Has a grocery store and a couple of laundromats very close-by. Also close to many tourist attractions. Close to Union Square, Grace Cathedral, both cable car routes, the list goes on. Hotel is very well situated.I had a great 5 night stay. My room was spacious, with a walk-in closet, very clean, with a kitchenette. Free breakfast (I'm not going to complain about free food), free computers with internet and a printer.The only thing that wasn't great was that the phone in my room didn't work. But the staff were friendly and I got their help in what I needed to do. Plus with the internet, I didn't miss the phone.This is a clean, proper hotel but at a fraction of the cost. This is the ONLY place I will go to when I go back to San Francisco.

<Content>Very happy at the Mayflower My husband and I stayed at the Mayflower for 5 nights, including New Years. We had a wonderful and wouldn't have picked another hotel. A little background: my husband and have lived in big cities including Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco. My husband lived in the Russian Hill area of San Francisco for over 2 years just a few years ago.Now for the review: the hotel was very clean, including our room. When we checked in we were given a tour by the owner's (Nancy) husband. He showed all us all the different rooms, and gave us a choice of what room we wanted. It is a good idea to do this as all the rooms are bit different and you may find one you like more than another. For example, some rooms have newer refrigerators than others, different cabinetry, etc. They are in the (slow) process of remodeling the wet bar in each room and when they are all done they will look great! Currently, most of them are quite old, but still in good condition. We really enjoyed having a mini fridge and microwave in our room and was one of the many reasons we chose the Mayflower.We also picked a room on a higher floor, as the first and second floors are more open to street noise and are also colder. Since we went in the winter, we wanted to be warmer without using the heat (to avoid stuffiness). We kept the window open most of our stay and the noise was negligible. My husband sleeps with earplugs and is an extremely light sleeper and we both slept well. The bathroom fixtures are new, with old and neat bones still in place. The entire hotel is like this really, with the lovely features that old buildings have still in place, but modernized. We found the staff very helpful and friendly for the most part. Some of the night staff were kind of disinterested, but at that point we were heading to bed and really didn't care. The breakfast that some people raved about was just so-so in our opinion. It's great that they offer it, but we weren't impressed. It's a nice continental breakfast, don't expect more than that. We didn't, and weren't disappointed because of it. Previous reviewers were not kidding about the size of the garage. It is so narrow you have to see it to believe it. Our rental ford focus barely fit, and I mean by mere centimeters. We switched cars mid way through our stay and our Toyota Corolla was a better fit, but not by much. The garage has to be opened manually, and if you come and go frequently, it can be a bit annoying to stop and get out of the car, have someone open the garage and drive it down, but it's not that bad. Especially when you consider the price, the narrowness and slight inconvenience are all worth it.Our room's walk in closet had a funky odor, but I didn't find it obnoxious or offensive. I think it's just from being closed and not often used. Just sort of stale smelling. I hung my clothes in it and they didn't absorb any of the odor. The water pressure in our room was fine, we didn't find it weak at all. The linens were clean and very homey. The neighborhood is just fine. We came and went at all hours of the day and night and encountered no issues whatsoever. The hotel is near the area aslo known as the noberloin or tendernob, a blend of one of the sketchiest areas in SF and one of the ritziest. You turn one corner and you're in sketchville, you turn another and you're surrounded by high end restaurants and hotels. But the Mayflower is closer to the Nob than the Loin. The hotel is locked at night to make sure only guests enter. We walked to Union Square, and Nob Hill and I am in not such great shape, and it was not that bad. The previous poster who complained about the distance and hills - puhlease! If you like driving everywhere, go visit a suburb. We walked up two giant hills to get to Nob Hill and survived. It was fun. The area is good. And for the price, I would say the area is great. I think you would be hard pressed to find such a good deal any where else in the city.

<Content>Great budget hotel I spent five days at the Mayflower. It's really a great option for less than a hundred dollars. The location is great, near Union Square and the room mas very big. Tou have free internet and , if you need you can also have a parking (for US$20). The breakfast is ok. A very good choice, much better ( and cheaper) than the motels at Lombard street.

<Content>Good If on a budget, average for everything else. Here is some background information before I jump on to the review. This past October, I traveled with a friend to San Francisco during the Canadian thanksgiving week-end and what coincided in San Francisco as Fleet week. The Blue Angels flew over the city a few times which was quite neat, although the public transit system downtown was overwhelmed, especially the cable car. Fact was, we learned that after booking our plane tickets and we were left hanging to find a decent hotel at a decent price. We're both university students in our early 20s and I'm pretty well traveled. Usually, I tend to select slightly plusher accomodation (thanks to a good job despite the student status), in the likes of Marriott, Hyatt, etc. Due to rates at 300$+ with limited availability, we booked the Mayflower for a night at 125$ for a Superior room, 45$ more than their standard room, but that would apparently afford us a room higher up and with a view. Given how many people mentionned noise problems, we decided to upgrade. Bottom line, I have a good connection and we were lucky to move to the W for the last two nights. I'll break down the review in two sections, positives and negatives.POSITIVE:-True to the reviews here, Nancy, the owner, is a very nice and helpful lady. A younger Spanish speaking woman working that night was also very nice. That can't be said for the rest of the staff we encountered. -Hallway carpets looked brand new and so did he hallways in general. I agree, everything must have been painted quite recently. Room carpets looked maybe a little older but were still very clean.-Old style elevators but remodeled.-Very nice lobby, front desk and charming breakfast room with a very good continental breakfast included in the room rate, comprising breads, cereals, fruits and coffee/tea/juice/milk and finally yoghurt. -Plumbing related bathroom fixtures obviosuly brand new and no hot water problems.-Free WiFi a big plus. -Kitchenette with fridge and microwave helpful for longer stays.-Plenty of toiletries, including soap, shampoo, lotion and mouthwash.NEGATIVE:-The man who checked us in was a little sketchy and caught off guard smoking outside as we were walking in to register. They do not take credit card information at the time of reservation but will require payment at check-in rather than check-out, even when paying by credit card which I found odd. I asked to see the room first. I recommend you do the same. -Some staff members were rude, including the first gentleman who made the reservation for us over the phone. Completely disinterested.-The kitchenette's glassware was quite visibly unclean, the wine glasses in our room all had either lip gloss or fingerprints on them. -We did not think not having Air conditioning was going to be a problem early Oct. in SFO but given our room faced the sun all afternoon, it was stuffy in there. We therefore kept the window open and it was VERY noisy as a result, despite facing the back. The room did not cool down much before around 3 am when a bunch of drunks yelling woke us up.and we decided to close the window. Ceiling fan helped a bit but I get congested when sleeping with that running so shut it off in the middle of the night. -My bedspread and pillowcases had old blood stains on them. -Room cleanliness was so-so with dust clearly visible in corners and our walk-in had a stench which prevented from storing any luggage in there. -Bathroom, other than fixtures, is clean but old and the shower head as a result came right around the level of my forehead. I'm only 5'9. You can imagine my 6'3 friend had a lot of fun washing his hair in the morning. Took forever given the weak pressure. -The alleged view was pretty much non-existent, our room, despite being on the 5th floor, overlooked neighboring buildings that obstructed most of the view. -Mattresses are brand new (according to their tags) but both me and my friend found them uncomfortable due to firmness. This is more subjective though.-I would disagree the location being good or great. The neighborhood was not re-assuring at night. I would not walk there alone and I'm a guy. Not much around and pretty much everything requires a steep walk downhill or uphill, making transit use mandatory. Union Square is a good 10-15 minute walk. Bottom line, the location is O.K. Nothing more.Would I return to the Mayflower? Possibly If nothing else was available. Based on what I experienced, I can understand why people on a budget like it. It's a roof over your head with a breakfast included. I also thought the 45 additional dollars for a higher floor room was a waste of money, given the rooms lower were described on the phone as being virtually identical. The said view was non-existent and the room, just as noisy as that 80$ room probably was. I probably would have felt I got a better bang for my buck with that room type. If looking for a place to sleep that's relatively clean and safely guarded, accessible by public transit to most of SFO's attractions and cheap, the Mayflower will do it. If you're like us and like your comfort and convenience location-wise, they are wiser options.

<Content>Very good deal and very friendly! Going back there!! The first week, we stayed at The Fairmont but, because of a major convention, we had to leave there and went to The Mayflower. Our room at The Mayflower was half the price of The Fairmont with many extras, including a garage for the car. We had free wireless ($14.95 a day at The Fairmont) and free continental breakfast ($33 for breakfast at The Fairmont). Quaint atmosphere and felt more like old San Francisco, but very clean and neat. We will go back for another night before returning to China.

<Content>Great find for budget conscious travellers. The Mayflower is an excellent find for those on a budget. I paid approx 拢40.00 a night for my room and it was more than adequate. The room was very big and plenty of storage of space. Shower was powerful and water always hot. Mattress was comfotable and room was very clean. Staff always pleasant and very helpful at check-in. If you are going to pick fault with it then I guess you could say it is in need of renovation. The buffets in the rooms are very old and do look a little tatty. The danger of renovating though is the price increase it would bring. Also the windows are originals, hence the noise from the street, which can become a disturbance. Free internet access is also a big PLUS. Always helpful to have this facility, especially when trying to make travel arrangements with other people you are trying to meet up with. Nice touch. One thing I will say is that the Lillies in reception are far too overpowering and would be nice if they were replaced with something else.

<Content>It had it's ups and downs We enjoyed our stay overall but when we checked in we had some serious problems with the managers. Because of some miscommunication with the number of people traveling with us, we had too many people in the room. While the woman who was helping us was very helpful, the man who was also was there was unnecessarily rude and almost yelling at us. It is absolutely ridiculous how he was treating us and completely disrespectful. He was the only problem we had with the hotel, the rooms were big and the bathrooms were nice. I would recommend it as a budget hotel that you are using just for sleep. Great location.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Good Price, Great Staff Stayed at the Mayflower with another couple. Two rooms between 3 of us. The hotel is situated in a very good location, near to Union Square, with a garage in the next block.The staff, Nancy and Nick, are friendly and extremely helpful. Rooms are clean, with two huge wardrobes, a very comfy bed and overall this theme hotel has a very cosy charm. It's not posh, but heck, it's not meant to be.At the prices offered, this is a really, really good deal - with breakfast (albeit simple) thrown in too.HIghly recommended, no complaints whatsoever. Just read the other reviews. This hotel is ranked in the top 50 out of 240 hotels in SFO, including the high end pricier posher ones. I guess that affirms my view.

<Content>Perfect! Myself and my 2 friends stayed at The Mayflower for 3 nights in July and we were most impressed! The staff were all very friendly and when we arrived they gave us a map and told us where we should head to in the city and where the nearest bus/cable stops were - they even gave us a bottle of wine from the nearby Napa Valley to take to our room! The rooms were a good size, the beds were very comfortable and although there wasn't air con there was a large ceiling fan which was more than adequate... our room had a small kitchenette with a fridge and microwave and 2 very large walk in cupboards. Breakfast was basic but more than fine for the rate we paid. Location-wise this hotel is perfect, it is in a safe area and within walking distance to all the attractions in San Francisco. This is an old building but that adds to the charm! The lift in the reception area is particularly dinky! Oh and an added bonus was the computer area with free internet access.

<Content>Exactly what I wanted I was visiting San Francisco for 3 days, primarily to see my son and go to a game at ATT Park (the Diamondbacks won! yay!). His studio apartment wouldn't quite work for the two of us but I wanted to stay close. I couldn't get any closer as the Mayflower is literally the building next to his apartment building. This was a cool old building with a very nice lobby and loft/mezzanine. The staff made me feel right at home. This is an historic building that while serviceable was not what I would describe as renovated. It was clean and comfortable, though, and it would be a tragedy if this place was brought to its full potential and turned into a trendy boutique hotel that cost $300 a night. Some might find the street-facing rooms a little noisy. I would/will certainly stay here again.

<Content>Great value  Chosen on Tripadviser recommendations. Excellent place and very friendly and helpful staff, especially Nancy. Even returned things we had left behind. Difficult to believe that the combination of location and price can be beaten. Great sandwiches next door.

<Content>Better than expected for the price I didn't get off to a good start here, as my rental Chevy Impala wouldn't fit through their garage doors. But it all picked up after that. The staff was very friendly, my room looked like it had been recently painted -- as did the corridors -- which is good in a building as old as this one. (The elevators are the kind that require you to open the door to get out.) My room had a small kitchenette with a tiny fridge, microwave, a sink, counter space, a couple of plates, a couple of bowls, and a fork. (Not sure what you would put in a bowl that you can eat with a fork.) No A.C., but there was a ceiling fan. That was fine. I got a room on the quiet side -- and it was, even though the Mayflower is in the heart of the city, between Union Square and Nob Hill. For those not real familiar with Nob Hill, if you're going to Grace Cathedral, be warned that the 2 blocks between the Mayflower and the Cathedral are about the steepest blocks you'll ever see. The Powell-Hyde cable car, which is good for getting around, is a quick 3 blocks away. The Mayflower offers a complimentary breakfast of sorts, which seems increasingly common in hotels/motels. Muffins, packaged cheese, coffee, bananas, orange juice, milk, cereal....Price for 2 nights was $175 total. Absolutely no complaints, and would stay there again. But I'll rent a smaller car next time.

<Content>A great, friendly hotel The staff here were really friendly and were very helpful. They told us were to go and where not to go. The rooms are clean and a good size. Our room contained two large cupboards, a microwave and a 'fridge. The property is old and is not your modern day fancy hotel - but this adds to the charm. check out the old fashioned elevators!It is centrally located and within walking distance of most things. The breakfast is a simple buffet and quite basic - but fine.If I were to stay in San Francisco I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Simply the best This is one of the hidden gems of San Francisco.I stayed at the Mayflower on recommendations of others for the last two days of a three week business/holiday trip. Everything about this hotel is A1 - the rooms, location, service and especially the owners and their staff.If you don't visit another city before you die, visit San Francisco. But please, stay at the Mayflower.And don't kick the door in [in joke].

<Content>Wonderful staff We stayed at this hotel this month and were so impressed with the wonderful staff. The Hotel was very nice with decent sized rooms, a huge walk in wardrobe, kitchenette with microwave, fridge and sink, spacious bathroom with beautiful toiletries. The Bed was a double, very comfortable with equally comfortable pillows. The breakfast was very nice and we (4 People) were all very happy with our selection. The rooms was very clean and housekeeping was fast and efficient. We found all of the staff to be excellent and the owners were such lovely people we almost felt that we were friends staying in their home. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. It isn't 5 star if that is what you are looking for but if like us you like something clean, comfortable and affordable then you should give this one a try.

<Content>The worst hotel experience of my life! My husband and I booked a room at the Hotel Mayflower for the last two nights of our California vacation. We chose the Mayflower because the picture of the lobby looked nice, it was cheap, and we had been splurging on pricier rooms for most of our trip. We checked in and went to check out our room - we we're very disappointed with everything beyond the lobby. It's like an old senior apartment building. It smelled like a nursing home and the bed looked 25 years old - with a dip in the middle of the mattress. Oh well, we'd make due I thought. We went back to the car to get our luggage and when we returned, the front door was locked. I rattled the doorknob, my husband pushed on the other side, I was going to ring the buzzer, but looked in and saw someone coming to the door. He peeked out and said Did you kick the door? You kicked the door. Find another motel, I don't want you here. And then he slammed the door. I thought it was a joke at first, or he was a crazy resident, or even that it was a scam to get our money. Turns out he was legitimately kicking us out for allegedly kicking the door. It was insane! Here we had paid for our room, and we're struggling to the door with all our luggage and ITS LOCKED. Do you think we could perhaps be offered some HELP from the staff for goodness sake. NO, we're locked out and then KICKED OUT !We were dumbfounded and quite angry for being treated so rudely , but agreed we'd never dream of staying there after being treated this way anyways and so we waited for them to refund our credit card and left quietly. We SO wanted to kick the door for real on the way out!This story has a happy ending. We found a MUCH NICER hotel a few blocks away - Hotel Carlton- The staff was kind, the decor was new, everything was clean, even valet parking for only $20 more a night!

<Content>Great Location Great location to everything in the city, only a few blocks away from the cable car. Free bottle of wine at check-in, cheap parking but a tight fit in the garage. Staff was great at giving directions. Definitely will stay there again if I get back to the city.

<Content>A great hotel. We found the Hotel Mayflower to be a well run establishment with friendly and helpfull staff. The room rates are very reasonable and well equipped with fridge, air con and en suite bathroom with shower and bath. On arrival all guests get a bottle of wine. There is undergroung parking available for approx 10 cars which was provided to us free of charge. It is a very tight space and SUV's may struggle but no problem for the average saloon car. There is free internet access with three computers available for use by guests. Literatue and advice is freely available in the Hotel. Bush Street is only 10 mins walking from the heart of the city and Trams, Buses and taxi's are even closer. This is a great Hotel on a budget.

<Content>Hotel is a personal choice I stayed at the Hotel Mayflower in March 2007, after reading all the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor about the hotel. Yes, I totally agree with all the good comments. Staff were friendly and attentive, even with her limited English the housekeeping staff took very good care of me. The location is fantastic, except Bush Street could be a problem if you are a light sleeper. Breakfast was complete (considering the room rate) The hotel is not of five-star class, but with basic necessities and great location. However, I believe hotel is a personal choice for everyone. I like the hotel, but it's not my cup of tea. I'm a regular to San Francisco and the reason for travelling is to socialise and get to know people, but this hotel didn't offer me the chance to do so, as much as the other hotels I've stayed during my previous visits.

<Content>Not Bad, But Not Great Either My wife, son and I stayed at the Mayflower June 11-14. We arrived a few hours early, the clerk let us keep our bags there while we went out exploring. That was a nice gesture. When we arrived at our room, however, we were put in a one bed room, when we clearly booked a 2 bed room months ago. That caused some tepidation. But the manager was called and made it right, giving us the first night free. I can understand why guests do not like being on the Bush Street side of the hotel. That street is very loud and alot of traffic. The room we stayed in had no air conditioning and in the 80 degree weather we experienced, we were very warm all night. Thank God for the ceiling fan Many reviewers mentioned the friendly staff. We did not experience this. The clerks went about their business, but were never friendly, and a couple clerks kind of glowered at us when we would first enter the lobby. Two asked us what our business was in the lobby, and we had to tell them we were guests in their hotel. I didn't care for their tone. The breakfast was meager. It looked like they went next door and bought bread and peanut butter and instant oatmeal. It was very plain and no imagination at all. One day after returning back to our room after a day in the 90 degree weather, the housekeeper had turned our ceiling fan off. The room never did cool down. Also, the cable was very basic, and a few channels were always very fuzzy. But you get what you pay for. We never felt unsafe, and we did get to keep our bags at the hotel when we first arrived. Plus, we were reembursed for the first day miscommunication, which was a plus. Would I come back again? Only if I couldn't get a hotel closer to the Wharf.

<Content>Great value for the price! This hotel is so cute and has an old world charm. It's been renovated to its original architecture. You cannot beat the price and the hospitality. I only paid $80 for a one bedroom w/ two double beds and a kitchenette. It's not far to walk from Bart and the neighborhood is totally safe. It was very clean as well. I highly recommend it and would definitely come back!

<Content>What a Fantastic Find! My husband wanted to take a low-budget weekend trip to San Francisco for our first anniversary  being the Deal-finder I am, I tracked down the Mayflower. For only $80 I was a little scared of where we'd end up. What a fantastic surprise! Some of the highlights:- Wonderful staff, very friendly  helpful- Great location... walking distance to Union Square- Safe, clean neighborhood- Free high-speed Internet access in room- Continental breakfast (toast, muffins, oatmeal, juice, coffee, etc.)- Free basic cable- On-site parking (if you have a small car) usually cheaper than public garages- Spacious, clean rooms (with a kitchenette)- Refrigerator, microwave and nice bath ammenities- We got a complimentary bottle of a great red wine when we checked in- Extremely safe... the doors were locked at night and we had to be buzzed in (with ID)The hotel is very charming and historic, but still very clean. My very anti-city husband felt safe  comfortable both in the hotel and the surrounding area. The rooms are not luxurious or fancy, but If you are looking for a great deal on a fantastic, authentic SF hotel- this place can't be beat. We'll definitely go back!

<Content>Worth more than you pay for! i stayed here a couple of weeks ago. nice clean hotel with great helpful staff! before you book your room though, make sure your heater/aircon is working in the room. the room i booked had a really weak heater and it was very cold in the morning. thank god the beddings were warm. also, ask for a room away from the main street. at 430am, you can hear the street cleaners trucks which really woke me up. otherwise, if you're on a budget but don't want to stay in a hostel, i highly recommend this place. i would stay here again.

<Content>Great price, great location Chose this hotel based on reviews and the price. $80 for a quiet room with a double bed, TV with basic channels, small kitchenette w/ fridge, microwave, and dishes, and a huge closet. It also included a basic continental breakfast with coffee, tea, oj, oatmeal, bread, fruits, baked goods. Front desk was helpful, we were able to check-in at an earlier time, and when we checked out, we were able to store our luggage for a few extra hours. There was wi-fi access, as well computers which helped us plan our trip around SF.Location was great!!! Quite close to the cable cars and MUNI stops. Be careful if you don't know your way around, did manage to wander into Tenderloin area while exploring on our first day. Did feel safe, doors are locked after a certain time, and we just buzz in to get back into the hotel after a long night out :)

<Content>a great deal for the price I stayed at the Mayflower after reading the good reviews on Trip Advisor and getting a great rate for the week. The room was only $80 per night, which is very low for San Francisco. For that price, we had a relatively nice and clean room on the 5th floor of the hotel. Our room faced onto Bush Street which can be noisy in the morning, so request a room on the other side of the building if that that may be an issue you. The location of the hotel is fantastic. If you don't mind climbing a steep hill, the California Street cable car line is only two blocks away, providing easy access to the financial district and the Ferry Building. It is also only two or three blocks from the Powell street line, which goes to Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf. Union Square is within easy walking distance as are many restaurants and cafes. The Mayflower is next door to a small market and deli, which was extra convenient since my room had a small kitchenette with a refrigerator. If you don't wake up in time for the continental breakfast (coffee, juice and toast) it is nice to have access to your own refrigerator. Another bonus is that the hotel has its own parking garage. Many hotels in the city charge guests up to $35 per day, but the Mayflower only charged me $10 even though they quoted $20. This included in/out privileges, but you must ask the front desk attendant to open the garage for you as the door is not automatic. The only warning is that the garage is very small. Not only are the spaces small, but the entrance to it is very small as well. Definitely don't plan on parking here if you have an SUV, or even anything larger than our Civic. Overall, the Mayflower is a great hotel. If you don't expect a 5-star room, you will be pleased with the free wireless access and cute details of a quirky old building. Definitely, the price is good for such a great location.

<Content>Old yet familiar This was a wonderful choice it was very resonable and the access to the area is just great. Being on top of one of the hills in San Francisco gives you a great view from Bush St down to the Financial District. Plus it is a short walk to Grant which is where China Town is. The proximity to Tenderloin was a concern until I realized that it was far enough up that the undesirable elements wouldn't go so far as to get this location. The Staff is wonderful they let me in every night since I stayed out and they were very helpful. I was able to even check in at 12 Pm. There is art in all the hallways in this beautifully decorated hotel. The street noise can be a bit much. I did speak the manager about this and she said that the city would not let her change them to double pained windows because it was historic. After all that walking getting to sleep isn't much of a problem.
