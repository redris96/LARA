<Content>You get what you pay for!!! BEWARE OF DRUGGIES There's really no where to park but on the street (parking meters) if you're lucky enough to find a spot! The first night we arrived we parked around the corner of the hotel and there were people dealing/smoking crack right on the sidewalk. I know they saw us but obviously didn't care. The alley on the side of hotel is a place for homeless to also do drugs or pass out. Hotel room was clean and cozy but they painted the inside of the bathtub and the whole bottom was peeling. I wore sandals in the shower. Breakfast was just toast with jelly and coffee, tea, and juice. Front desk was nice. Hotel is close to shopping mall/farmer's market. Wouldn't recommend to anyone with children! Overall the hotel was ok for $50 a night, but would rather pay extra $$ for a nice hotel, just to not deal with crackheads!

<Content>Great place to stay if you're young. My friend and I stayed here for a total of four nights and had a great time. All the other tenants in the hotel were very nice and so were to hotel staff. The hotel itself had a very quaint, old romantic feeling that both of us liked and the elevator was really old and awesome. I am disappointed to read that people paid less than I did to stay in the hotel considering that I thought I got a pretty good rate at $69 per night. Within walking distance to BART station, bus stops, restaurants and a neat farmers market that I saw Sunday and Monday morning. I will certainly be staying here again if I should return to San Francisco.

<Content>Got we paid for- but very cheap Stayed with my wife for 9 nights. $30 US a night was great! Was in what some may think is a dodgy neighbourhood, but we had no problems. Geat access to public transport. Main issue was bad plumbing- toilet often blocked and had to move rooms once. Service was also very minimal. But for the price we couldnt complain too much.

<Content>Horror Hotel I stayed at this hotel with a friend due to its close proximity to a concert we were attending down the street at the Warfield. What a mistake!!! Yeah it had old decor and I couldn't fit on the bed ( I'm 6'3). but all off that pales in comparison to what I found in the bathroom. I noticed that the cute country style mirror was set in a window frame. So my first thought is  I wonder if his opens like a window? so I grab the window frame and what do ya know it opened right up. So there I am standing in the bathroom staring through a hole in the wall into a dark hallway about four feet wide that ran the length of our room. So now I'm wondering if my mirror might be one-way and I'm afraid to shower or use the toilet. I also can't sleep the entire night from the fear of someone entering our room through this mirror. At different points through the night my friend and I could hear people in this vacant area outside our room. It felt like a bad horror movie. At least we could watch the Dealers selling crack outside our window all night for entertainment while we weren't sleeping. To sum up: I will not be staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Totally misleading! This was the worst hotel ever!!! When I looked it up on line it looked ok, but when I got there I was really surprised. It looked NOTHING like the on-line photo's, looking really run down. My room was crappy as well, and the bathroom looked like a total dump! I didn't even feel safe in the hotel, nor did I feel safe walking around outside since the hotel's in gangster-land. No wonder it's so cheap! DO NOT STAY HERE (seriously).

<Content>This Place Is Hell!!!!! My hubby and I came here for our anniversary and WOW was it ever ruined. when we first checked in, our room was not ready and so they went to put us on the 5th floor and the door looked like it had been kicked in and the people 3 rooms down was really loud having relations went to complain that we could not get into room and they said that they were going to put our things into another room until original room was cleaned and we went into room and I was pissed because there was drug paraphenalia all over the room and I took a first aid glove and picked up the crack pipe and took it to the front desk and the guy had the galls to insinuate that it was mine and I got mad and left for awhile and when we came back they moved us to another room and the mirror was on the floor by the wall and there was twin beds and we were right next to the antique elevator and ever time sone one came on or off of it the door slammed and woke us up. we left early and complained to the Howard Johnson Corporation and all the did was send us a coupon for $25.0 off saying that we can use it on our next visit. YEAH RIGHT!!!

<Content>Do Not Stay Here We knew upon booking that The Abigail was not a 5-star hotel and we did not expect it to be. However, we expected something better than a hostel in Europe. We were sadly mistaken. Upon arrival (11 am), we were told that check-in was not until 3 pm and there were no rooms available at all. After checking or bags at the desk and walking around until 3 pm we returned to check in. We then found out that we had 2 double beds instead of a queen that we requested. We were told no other rooms were available at all and we would have to take that room. We then discovered there was no ice machine in the hotel (yet they had ice buckets and glasses in the room; go figure). There were no electrical outlets in the room, only extension cords that magically came up from the base boards (that can't be up to fire code) and if that was not weird enough, only 2 outlets out of 4 on the extension cord actually worked. The walls throughout the hotel were dented and mudded, but never painted again. We found mold growing in our room (um health liability) and the front desk clerks would have been better suited to work fast food than to be at the front desk of a hotel. Even if you are on a budget, STAY AWAY from the Abigail, sometimes saving money is not worth the annoyances and problems you get into.

<Content>OK little hotel, good location Got this hotel for $50/nt and stayed for two nights. It was OK for the price and location. The front desk was good and friendly, but not informative at all about the city. It's just opposite the Asian Art Museum and next to Civic Center, City Hall, Market Street, and Civic Center BART/Muni Station. Chinatown and Union Square are also in a short-walk distance. It's in a good location to get around this city.We initially booked for a double-bed room, but got a king bed instead. However, the room is quite small with a TV, a working desk, and a small love seat . You have a very little area to walk around the bed. Bathroom is rather old, but clean. The hallway is clean and nothing looks like some images posted in the past even though they're still renovating a few guest rooms. The worst thing during our stay is that the room was quite cold at night as the heater in our room in the 6th floor didn't work well. We asked them to fix that, but it didn't help. As other reviews mentioned about the homeless, I didn't see a lot of them. Maybe it's too cold and wet during this time of year for them to wander around.Overall, it's good value for budget-mined travellers.

<Content>Flop-House In Skid Row I have never had such a horrifying experience at a hotel in my life! (and hopefully never will again) Upon entering the inner sanctum, better known as the lobby, we were greeted by a not-so-friendly desk clerk, whom, I guess doubled as night watchman,( since he later sacked out on the lobby sofa, snoring as we passed by upon returning in the evening.) The elevator was so rickety and small, you could barely get on with a small suitcase. The floor had a mushy bounce to it, and it felt like it was lined with cardboard. As it lurched into its ascent, I remember reciting the Lord's Prayer. When we finally reached our floor, I was still praying as we opened the door to the little shop of horrors. The exposed wires of a single light bulb dangled from the ceiling fan, which more resembled an interrogation device rather than an actual fixture. The other code violations and many infractions we took note of are too numerous to mention here. That night, when we returned to our hotel room, exhausted from walking around the area in search of alternate options for lodging, which my son found on line, we were about to climb into bed, when I noticed the stained and dingy-looking bed linen. We went down to our vehicle and brought up a blanket and laid it on top of the bed, where we slept fully clothed, ready to depart at day-break. Unfortunately, not much sleep actually occurred because we were awakened to the sounds of very loud arguing and screaming emanating from the run-down building next door to the hotel. This went on until day-break, when my husband turned to me and said , Are you ready? , to which I wasted no time jumping off that flea-bag bed, grabbing our belongings, and racing to the rickety elevator. As we flew by the front desk, bags in hand, I heard the clerk inquire Are you coming back?, to which I hollered over my shoulder, NO! I will never come back here again! As we pulled away from the curb, I bade goodbye to the Abigail Hotel (and the reprobate urinating on the lamp post outside the building) NEVER AGAIN!!

<Content>Nice clean hotel great for the price! We stayed at this hotel recently and I had booked it after reading the latest Oct 2007 reveiws and yes I have to agree with them that although its not the best hotel in town, I dont think you could get a better deal for the price and loctaion in downtown San Francisco. The hotel is neat and clean, yes it is old but if you are looking to just sleep during the night its a good place. We were in SFO for a short time and were mostly out exploring the city during the day, so it worked out great for us. Its definitely not the place for you if you have in mind a relaxing hotel stay! The staff is curteous and quite helpful

<Content>We found this hotel to be quite quaint and charming. The owner took a personal interest in us. We were always greeted upon entering the hotel. The room was very clean, with the housekeeping staff coming in daily to change the linen and towels. On our first day there, they called the cab company for us to get to the hospital on time. We live in the country and really dislike city living, but the staff at the Abigail made us feel at home.For the price, you can't beat it.4 STARSEndorsed by Dalevis (An Elvis Tribute Artist)

<Content>Good location and a cute hotel! I found the Abigail Hotel to be very agreeable, especially for the price. The room was spacious and clean, with new locks and lighting fixtures. The staff was always friendly and seemed hard-working. This hotel is in a great location - a short walk away from the Opera House and Market Street, and not too far by foot from Chinatown or Union Square, if one doesn't mind a short hike. The only downsides I could find were that the hotel is rather old and in need of cosmetic renovation (though that in no way reflects the quality of service and room comfort), and that the area in which it is located - the Civic Center - is a little seedy. However, we had a great experience there and really enjoyed our stay!

<Content>OK for the Price; Excellent customer service Well, I read the previous comments and all I can say is that I had a different experience. Staff was very proactive and educated, willing to help all the time. The room was good for the price. Location in downtown, you cannot beat that. I know, it is not the GREATEST place on earth, but they are trying to provide a clean and good service. I definetely come back to the Abigail Hotel and I hope that you do so too. RELAX.AGAIN, it is not the best for the picky individuals.

<Content>The Worst Hotel in the US We stayed in this hotel the past weekend, Oct 6, 2006, on our weekend getaway to SF. I'm not a picky one or could care less about fancy hotels but boy, this was something. When you just enter the hotel, it looks old and has this smell to it but they were remodeling the lobby, so, we didn't care. We had a room on the 5th floor and when we entered, I was shocked. Check out the pictures posted in one of the other reviews. That's exactly how the room looked like - broken cabinet doors, chipped ceiling/walls, no curtains, dirty windows, a dirty bathroom. The worst thing was the bed itself. The sheets were dirty, had stains on them and there was cigarette smoke smell everywhere. We went downstairs and asked for a new blanket. The guy brought a new one but didn't take the old one and told us to throw it on the floor. He still didn't offer to change the bed sheets and the pillow covers. It was too late for us to go anywhere else and were forced to spend the night there. I honestly think that it's hazardous to stay here. They must be in violation of some sort of laws. My nose was swollen the next morning. It was so terrible that come next morning, we checked out. I beg everybody to please DO NOT check into this hotel. There are other very affortable hotels around that are CLEAN. For example, just blocks away is Red Coach Lodge - that's where we stayed our second night.

<Content>Abigail, you're a major disappointment! This hotel was nothing like the image created by its website. I was expecting a homely bijoux hotel, but was greeted by a cold and dark hallway and an even colder room.The ratings on a series of sites ranged from 3*to 5*, so I was hoping for a modicum of cleanliness. Again, I was disappointed.Staff, though friendly, were of not much use. On my first day, upon enquring which direction I should go in (I'd read warnings about the area several blocks away, so wanted to avoid it) the receptionist apologised that she wasn't from the area and didn't know which direction the hotel faced!I understood from the one other guest I met whilst there that in 2003 it was indeed a lovely hotel, but those owners had left. This is a shame, as it's location is excellent.

<Content>The rat hole We took one look at the room and walked out, there was no way we would stay there and I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. Windows were broken, holes from cigarettes in the beds. Sheets were ripped-off. Carpet was covered with dirt. Personal told us that it was the best room they had. My daughter almost cried...

<Content>What a dump! If you read any descriptions of the Abigail Hotel, forget them. The hotel must have changed hands since they were written.There is no Millennium Vegetarian Restaurant, bar, lounge, room service, parking or coffee making facilities.The hotel is now mainly residential.The room and furnishings were grubby, there were holes in the curtains and bedding, the TV was unwatchable.Staff were unhelpful, the maid didn't turn up, we were not given clean towels (we were told there weren't any).We had booked a quad room, for 3 adults. We were given a double room with one double bed and one folding camp bed.If you want a good, budget hotel in San Francisco, try the Air Travel.

<Content>You need to be street wise! We stayed 2 weeks for $35 per night for a dbl rm. Fantastically cheap (via an agent in London) bt you get what you pay for. Clean room bt desperately old decor. Cigarette burns on the carpet and (clean) bedding. Rm cleaned/bed changed every 3 days. Web page totally inaccurate. No restaurant (famous veggie restaurant closed years ago), no tea/coffee making facilities, staff pleasant bt uninterested and no additional information or tourist advice given but for leaflets in the slightly grubby foyer. Area is incredible - our view was the beautiful City Hall but it is also a rough neighborhood so hence the title of this review! While we were there we heard arguments with the Hotel Manager and long term residents, the glass of the foyer front door was kicked in and the police visited once to evict a tenant.I would suggest young, travel wise backpackers stay here for a few nights only.Traditional tourists; you won't like it. Families with children; absolutely not.

<Content>Not bad for the price. I found this hotel at the last minute for a three night stay in September 2004. It is an odd place. It is a Howard Johnson hotel, but is really part hotel and low-income residence. The front part of the building is a hotel, the rest are tenant-occupied. For this reason it is a little unnerving. The rooms are clean, just a little worn. They look like old studios quickly converted to hotel rooms with TV armoires in front of an old closet door. The rates were cheap and the staff nice but they weren't very fluent in English. No parking available. Close to Civic Center and easy to walk to Market Street.
