<Content>Nice Room,Good Location Great loaction 2 blocks from Plaza Catalunya so perfect for sight seeing if you want to be near everything but dont want to stay around the noisy Las Ramblas.Airport bus 鈧? one way and stops at the end of the road (get off at the stop after Plaza Catalunya) The rate we got included breakfast which was served till 11am. The hotel was fine for a weekend break, would consider this hotel a good 3* then a 4*.

<Content>decent room, good breakfast, good location I will focus more on details, as major things are ok - such as location etc.I made reservation for a queen bed double room. Once i got to the hotel there was only 1 room available in the conditions required. The room was no larger than 12 sq meters, bathroom another 10 sq m. The window was facing a close building - 2 m away - so no possibility for natural light in the room. So I went to the reception and asked for another room, even with 2 separate beds (altough we were a couple). They offered us a room in the building right close to the hotel - an apartment building owned partially by the hotel. The room was actually a junior suite at 1st floor, nice large windows facing the street and pretty spacious - at least 40sq m. Pretty clean too - but i was interested only in the sleeping details of the room as staying in Barcelona in a hotel room was not my objective..:) The city is great - you feel you could stay out there day and night.The bathroom was pretty poor - the sink being clogged in my case. The bed sheets and towels need to be changed - as they are pretty old and probably over used - you could smell the extra chlor used for washing.The personnel was ok, they gave us directions and info requested - but nothing out of regular stuff.The breakfast was the best service of the hotel i think (except location). Very reach buffet with cold and warm dishes. Strongly recommend this buffet.The price for the room in this conditions is pretty high, but once again - location is the one that really matters.

<Content>good location, good rooms, nice personnel we had booked a double, which was changed to a triple the day before our arrival (located next door to the hotel main entrance).very friendly staff, excellent room (soundproof, good size, perfect bathroom).the location, close to the Gaudi houses and to the metro access, is perfect.

<Content>Location, Location, Location! 2nd visit to this hotel and once again an enjoyable stay. No its not a palace but its not a dive either. It is.....a busy, clean, extremely well located city centre hotel (which means the views are of other city buildings ! duh!) with friendly and helpful staff. This is an excellent base for anyone contemplating sightseeing in Barcelona...just off the Passeig de Gracia, about two blocks up from Plaza Catalunya. You can take the bus from the airport and walk up from the square or take the train and walk down a couple of blocks to the hotel. The train station on Passaig de Gracia links you to the main train station at Sants and is so convenient for visits to Girona, Madrid or even Parc Adventura (1hr 20mins). Be warned though if you want to go anywhere via the AVE fast train you must book in advance as they are extremely busy. Plenty of restaurants and tapas bars around the hotel and the shopping of passaig de Gracia 2 minutes away! Our air conditioning worked perfectly well...often too well and we had to turn it down! Room was cleaned dailly with a change of towels and bedlinen. Staff at reception were helpful as were those we had contact with at the bar. Can't comment on the food as we did not eat in the hotel...to many choices outwith! 5 mins walk to Ramblas, Gothic quarter and Bus Turistica Tour main stop in Plaza Catalunya. Basically this is a very well run tourist class hotel which could not be better situated if it tried. Why do people want 5 stars facilities etc for a 3 star price???

<Content>Good location, hotel very average My wife and I just returned two days ago from a 4 night stay. We chose Barcelona for a short break because of very cheap Ryanair flights from Bournemouth, near where we live, and not having been to Barcelona before, we thought we should give it a try. Hotel first: Functional, clean, comfortable. Our room 204 on 2nd floor, overlooking street, bit noisy but what do you expect from a city hotel. Staff were always there and seemed to be doing their job well enough, I don't always expect bright, smiley faces, simple courtesy is good enough. Did not use the bar, never seemed that busy. Did not eat at the hotel either so, as you can gather, our requirements were for a hotel in a good location with a clean  comfortable room in which everything worked. We got that, although we do have a couple of gripes about the hotel. The walls are very thin. The couple next door were clearly (and in the lady's case very audibly) enjoying a romantic getaway (good for them) I just wish I hadn't heard it all. Also, on Thursday afternoon we heard a street protest and looked out of the window to find there were about 40 or 50 protesters with banners and leaflets, loudspeakers etc, protesting against the hotel! No idea why, so we went out and when we came back it was all over, my wife asked at reception if it was likely to happen the next day, and reception said in matter of fact fashion Oh no, it only happens on Thursdays - what's that all about? The real advantage of the hotel is the location - just north of the gothic quarter in the upmarket shopping and commercial district. A brisk 20 minute walk to the port, 5 minutes to the Placa Cataluyna, 10 minutes into the gothic area, and 15 minutes in pretty well any direction, safe streets, nice shops and some decent eateries, with close walkable access to some of Gaudi's finest to the north and north east.If you're still with me, our views of Barcelona: Big, noisy, with too much traffic (even La Ramblas has two way traffic with a pedestrianised main thoroughfare right down the middle, frankly a little tacky, don't really get what all the fuss is about), generally more expensive than we expected, overall not hugely impressed with Barcelona. Simple tapas lunch for two near the Picasso museum in guide recommended eatery, with two tiny glasses of house wine each, with coffee, 40 euros, not great either. Good steak dinner for two with bottle wine  coffee, 90 euros (try Viento del Plato, imported Argentinian aged steaks). Gothic quarter is quaint enough with its alleys and squares, but no more so than many southern European historic centres. North of the gothic quarter is laid out in a block pattern, USA style, with wide avenues and streets, designer shops, a few bars, restauarnts, business etc, where the hotel is. Sagreda La Familia is basically just a construction site inside, don't pay to go in, see it for free from the outside.Tip for tour bus users, don't go for the big orange route (as we did), instead go for the red  blue bus routes which are more flexible and you are more likely therefore to use. Both are about 25 Euros for two days, hop on and hop off. We won't rush back to Barcelona, anywhere in Italy is better, but if we do find oursleves there again, Cristal Palace would be a reasonable base.

<Content>excellent location Just returned from 6 nights/5 day stay. Excellent location, close to everything, but on a quiet street in an uspcale district.The rooms are very small and extremely hot-had to sleep with open windows in March and heard many complaints about heat from other guests in the hotel as well. The beds are very firm, however the size of room and the hard beds are not unusual for hotels in Europe. The hotel was very clean, bathroom in our room 605 was modern and spotless, the towels were changed daily. The front door staff was not too friendly, but professional and helpful with tour and show reservations. Complementary use of computers is a benefit, make sure to request to print the boarding passes if you wish to do so, since there is no printer generally, but exceptions are made for boarding passes.We did not eat at the hotel, but the bar was pleasant enough after day of sightseeing.Overall, hotel is functional and clean, but at best 3 star. Would recommend for travelers who plan on sightseeing and spending littel time inside if you can get a good deal. Once again, location is amazing.

<Content>The Cristal was not my kind of Palace September 26-30, 2007This was my second organized tour since my college days some twenty years ago. I was on a tour organized by AHI International and we were to stay at the Cristal Palace for five nights. While our brochure listed the hotel as four star, first-class, I'd say that was a generous description. The hotel was ideally located a mere five minute walk from Las Ramblas and one of Gaudi's buildings was right around the corner. Breakfast and dinner were included in our package and served in the hotel's dining room. The food was fairly good, but by day four it would have been better to explore the local restaurants for dinner on our own. Our hotel room, a double, as I was traveling with my senior citizen mother, was adequate, and looked out to the court yard. My gripe with the room was in the bathroom. The first night I thought I heard water dripping and went to check the bathroom faucet. The dripping water was coming from the ceiling from the room above us!We immediately notified the front desk and they said they would fix the problem. The next day a maintenance person had come into the room and dabbed some fresh paint on the leak. (Ya, that's how I fix leaks at my house. NOT!)No suprise that the water continued to leak through the ceiling every night of our five day stay. Trying to sleep at night was like participating in a water tourture test, a mild test, I'll admit. We could hear the constant drips and eventual streaming of the water breaking through the paint repair.A friend of mine is heading to Barcelona in April and asked about my hotel stay at the Cristal Palace. I told her to look elsewhere.

<Content>Excellent Location!! Originally we'd plan to stay at a different hotel in the Gothic Quarter however after doing a bit of looking around we got a good deal at the Cristal Palace.The location was fantastic right in the L'Eixample area of the city  a two minute walk from the Passeig de Gracia where both the aeroport bus stops along with both the tourist bus companies. It was literally around the corner from the famous Casa Batilo  close to Placa de Catalunya.The only downfall to the location was that the L'Eixample area seemed to be one of the expensive areas for food  it was sometimes difficult to find breakfast (unless you ate at the hotel)The hotel itself was of a very high standard with an impressive lobby  the rooms were very clean  nice. We arrived at midnight  the reception staff were very helpful we were given a twin room  when we explained that we had booked a double they were happy to move us however it would be the following day  the staff were happy to move our luggage when we did move. The odd thing was that there was no kettle in the room but coffee  cups so if you wanted a morning cup of coffee you had to go out into the hallway  use the fancy coffee machine.Overall the hotel was great  you couldn't fault it so If you want a great location with a clean  friendly hotel then i would recommend the Eurostars Cristal Palace.

<Content>Good location for exploring the city We made a last-minute booking for this hotel and we weren't disappointed. We were given an apartment in the building next door to the main hotel, and it was very clean and spacious, with a nice lounge. It was reasonably priced, compared with others in the city.The hotel is a few minutes walk from the hurly burly of Las Ramblas, and in a slightly quieter location than many others. It's also very near to the bus station at Placa Catalunya. There was no city view - only a panorama of the workmen refurbishing the building opposite - not that we minded. They seemed to read newspapers a lot...As we weren't in the main hotel we chose not to use any of its facilities, and so can't comment on them. The staff seemed very competent and pleasant. Unfortunately, the hotel has the skinflint policy of charging for a safety deposit key (admittedly very small, though). That's just a trivial pet hate.The location was fine for walking to all the usual attractions - such as the Sagrada Familia and the Gothic District. In the L'Eixample district behind the hotel are a few coffee shops and bars which are ideal for breakfasts and snacks.We had a late departure and thought about extending check-out for a few hours. The price was 80 Euros, so we declined.In summary: we had a comfortable stay in a good quality room. We don't know what the main hotel rooms are like, but the apartments were fine. We'd definitely recommend them.

<Content>This Hotel Sparkles Just returned from a four night stay at the Cristal Palace in Barcelona. We were slightly put out on arrival when we were told that our friends were not booked in although this was soon sorted out. We were given adjacent rooms in the Apartment Block next to the Hotel.Believe me, this is not a minus. The apartment was a two floor enormous room with large lounge area ,sofas TV, Fridge etc.Upstairs on the Gallery landing were two beds plenty of wardrobe space and a very tasteful bathroom.We were absolutely delighted.Hotel restaurant served an excellant breakfast and the hotel is very clean (Bedding changed three times during our four day stay) Staff very helpful and obliging.The location is very good with the Passe De Gracia on minutes away and the Placa Catalnunia a short walk.Very handy for good quality shops and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.

Really good location and you won't need to use public transport or taxis at all unless you are heading out of the city eg airport or Nou Camp. The rooms are nothing special but are clean and comfortable. The reatuarant and bar in the hotel aren't really up to much but there's lot's about. I've returned here about three times already and have no compliants. The staff are really friendly and make an effort to be nice!

<Content>great location - to overpriced Boyfriend  I have just returned from a weekend stay at Cristal Palace. We booked this hotel after reading reviews on tripadvisor. The main thing we wanted was location. This was exactly what had been reported on here and was correct. It was excellent for walking about. The hotel we felt was very basic for the price we paid, far too expensive. I had requested a room on a low floor which was taken note of. The room was small, with twin beds pushed together instead of a double. Apart from the bin having the previous guests rubbish in it was very clean. I told the maid about the bin not being emptied and she cleaned it immediately. The staff spoke a little english but were helpful when I asked for directions and about the airport bus. The only main problem was the saturday I could not sleep because of the noise from the road and the traffic outside. Sunday night was quieter. We would reccommend this hotel for location but not for value for money. Thank you for the people who advised on here about the bus touristic which was excellent the best way to get around. My boyfriend was very disappointed because we went to the barcelona football stadium and it was closed for the tour. We went at 4pm on sunday but it closed at 2.30 that day. The cable cars were very good with a wonderful view. Apart from not seeing the stadium we had a lovely time. Also thank you to the person who suggested fresh  ready bakery they sell the best ham and cheese croissants i have ever had. Other advise I give is watch your bags and pockets at all time. We went prepared for pickpockets and avoided a scam because we had read about it. A lovely romantic weekend with lovely memories we will cherish.

<Content>Enjoyable stay at the Cristal Palace 6 of us booked 2 rooms before and after a cruise that left from Barcelona. I made the reservations through the hotel website and experienced no problems. The hotel staff was polite. and courteous. Check-in was efficient and we were quickly escorted to our rooms. The rooms are average in size but comfortably fit 3 of us in each room with the help of a rollaway bed. The rooms were clean and quiet. The breakfast buffet had several selections from dry cereal to eggs. The front desk staff was helpful at directing us to several good area restaurants.The Hotel is centrally located in the city with an easy walk to Las Rambles, Placa de Catalunya, and the Bus Turistic stops. There are plenty of nice restaurants and bars in the area. On the day of our departure we had an early Sunday morning flight. We requested 2 taxis for the six of us at 5:30 in the morning. They were waiting for us when we checked out.

<Content>Excellent Hotel in a great location We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights celebrating our 10 yr anniversay. The hotel was in an excellent location and was close to many of the main attractions. The bus stop and metro station are minutes away and its very easy to find.The hotel staff were very friendly and we was given a warm welcome, our room was very large with a lovely bathroom and jacuzi bath and was very quiet. Breakfast was a buffet and was very nice with a large variety of food that would suite any taste- again the staff were very friendly and the service brilliant as they were constantly refilling things when they were getting empty, it was very good that it was until 10.30am.It was very handy to have computers that were free to use to guests staying in the hotel.I would highly recommed this hotel to anyone who is going to Barcelona and it made our stay a very memorable one.

<Content>Four Star???? I really would not recommend this hotel. It has a good location only a short stroll from main attractions.However, the rooms are tiny with very poor amenities. We had several problems with the room. The staff were unhelpful and none of our problems were addressed. Compared to other 4 stars this hotel is seriously below par and i think other hotels in the area would offer better value for money.

<Content>Great 50th weekend! We stayed in Barcelona for 4 nights in January 2007 and would highly recommend the Crystal Palace. The staff were very helpful, the hotel was clean and well cared for, recently refurbished, and the rooms were ample in size and a great location for the underground system, tourist bus and La Ramblas.Some minor niggles about the hotel were that the room was so warm that you needed the window open all night, which was OK as there wasn't any significant street noise. If you like hot food for breakfast then there wasn't a great choice - frankfurter sausage, fatty bacon, sloppy scrambled eggs and half tomatoes with a bit of cheese on, however there were ample cereals; cakes; fruit; croissants; yoghurts etc. which more then made up for the poor hot food choices. Don't expect a great view if you have a room at the back of the hotel as 1st-8th floors look onto the back of a building. Poor amount of hanging space if you are going for longer than a few nights - just one small single wardrobe providing coat hangers that unclip from the rail, and x3 small drawers. Take a kettle if you like a cuppa first thing in the morning too as this hotel doesn't provide one.None of the above spoilt our holiday, as I said these were just minor niggles, overall this is a great hotel in a superb location - between the Pg de Gracia and Rbla de Catalunya, only about 5 mins walk to the Placa Catalunya where the tourist bus, ticket office is and where you can pick up both the blue and red line buses, also the top of La Rambla. There are 2 metro stations close to the hotel's street on Pg de Gracia + a tourist bus stop for the red line (which you need to visit the Segrada Familia)We had a wonderful time in Barcelona and found their transport system so refreshingly organised and easy to use. Looking forward to our next visit!

<Content>Not so special, where were the crystals? In winter, our rather small hotel room (apparently 4 stars?!) was VERY hot all the time. No airconditioning added to the frustration. Staff were alright, but advised us the market was shut on Sunday when in fact one or two local ones were open (we discovered ourselves). I don't understand how they rated this 4 stars. Overall I cannot complain though - maybe I am just comparing it to 4 star hotels I have been to that are much more glamorous.

<Content>Fantastic Location! We went for a short break to Barca and had a lovely time at the Cristal Palace Hotel. I can't really fault much about the hotel. The rooms were spacious, beds comfy, lovely clean bathroom. Our maid was amazing and left the room absolutely spotless and pristine. The receptionists were very helpful too. My only slight complaints were that the lobby bar was quite expensive (for two poor students anyway) and the coffee machine on our floor was broken. But these are trivial complaints and it would be expected for a hotel of this standard to charge higher than average prices for drinks. The location is perfect, 5 mins walk to Las Ramblas, lots of lovely restaurants, bars and shops!

I've payed a special price of 84 Euros/night for a double room without breakfast for a 2 nights stay in November 2006. The relation price/quality is good. The room is nicely decorated in light blue, with enough space to walk arround. The bathroom is big and very clean, such as the rest of the room, which has no carpet, good for who is alergic to dust. The staff is very kind. Also, you have at your disposal a computer in the lobby with free internet access, that became very handy for me to book may last night of stay in Bcn, because this hotel was already fully booked for this last night.

<Content>Fantastic value and great location Stayed at this hotel on 2nd November and have to say it was great value and a in an ideal location being only one block away from the Las Ramblas so just a few minites walk away.We only stayed one night but would like to have stayed longer in in this fantastic city.I upgraded to the Romantic room and it was a mere 125 Euros including a bottle of Cava in the price.Next time i may stay in one of the suites which are accross the road but have seperate bedrooms and loads of space and just 150 euros a night.We walked quite a way down to the marina and ate in a fantastic restaurant part of the Monchos group! check out this link apparently the one with the buffet is the best which was recommended to me by somebody who lived there for 4 years :----.Also we had a lucky night in the Casino which is located in the ARTS Hotel on the marina and people can get in with jeans etc which is strange but handy to know.Enjoy Barca but be carefull of the pick pockets and also the ladies with babies who approach you as they are all in on a scam that may leave you with less items that you went out with.

<Content>superb hotel This was our 4th visit to the city but first time at this hotel as we have stayed before at the Avenida Palace just around the corner. We are glad the (more expensive) Avenida was full as we chose this alternative purely on location and reviews and we were not disappointed. We will certainly stay here on any future visits to this wonderful city as we found our courtyard facing room quiet, spotless and with plenty enough space for a city hotel room. The bathroom was very spacious and well appointed. Staff were helpful and the breakfast (included in deal) was super with everything you could wish for. We have since recommended this hotel to several friends and clients.

<Content>More than we expected Having never traveled in Europe, we worried about finding a good hotel. How lucky we were to have found this one!We spent three nights pre-cruise here. Eleven of us traveled together, splitting between two hotels. The four that stayed in a more expensive (higher rated) hotel, were very disappointed. The seven who stayed in this hotel loved it. The rooms and bathrooms were clean and comfortable. The beds are very firm, but we slept great. The hotel is located in a GREAT area - a quiet street in the middle of everything. The staff was friendly and helpful.A few things to note about this hotel:1. As with most hotels in Europe, you must put your key in a slot inside your room to run all the electrical. 2. Also as with most European hotels, there are no washcloths.3. The shower over tub configuration in the bathrooms is fine, but there is nothing to keep the water contained, causing the floor to get wet and slippery. 4. Air conditioning in much of Europe isn't as robust as one might experience in the US. We had very hot weather during our stay, but the A/C in this hotel was pretty good.No complaints at all - we will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Can't go wrong with this hotel. The Cristal Palace is a clean, spacious hotel with individual controlled air-con in the rooms and a super location. Handy for everything. If you don't get breakfast included go out of the door of the hotel and turn right and right again at the corner. There are a few places on the next block up (towards Diagonal) which do lovely breakfast cakes (St Jaume) is a specialist cake bakery and has some cracking things on offer. For the Brits (like me) who like a cuppa in your room... take a travel kettle and t-bags! This is common in many european hotels... they just don't get the idea of tea when i fancy it. A very minor issue in an otherwise really nice hotel. You'll enjoy it. I found the staff all helpful... (some of the American comments suggest that they may be grumpy... not so but they won't kiss your bum either, you are in Barcelona, sort stuff out for yourself!)Pete and Family. Wirral. UK

<Content>Great location, value, especially for family Stayed here for 3 nights in July with my wife, 13 yo son, and 10 yo daughter. We booked a family room, which was outstanding. Very spacious. Second floor had two twin beds pushed together in a large bedroom, TV, a large bathroom with full bath/shower, and sink. The first floor had a bathroom with a shower and sink (no full size bath), a small alcove with a twin bed, and a large living room with a TV, small desk, two couches, and windows opening to the interior of the city block. We had no noise problems whatsoever, although I suspect that's because we were on the interior of the block. The kids really enjoyed having some privacy and their own beds. The location is great, it's 1/2 block from Passeig de Gracia, two blocks north of the north-end of Las Ramblas, two blocks north of Plaza de Catalunya, and one block from a Bus Turistic stop (hop-on/hop-off).We ate breakfast at the cafe across the street. The owner spoke a little bit of English, but my rusty Spanish definitely was useful when ordering. There is a computer downstairs in the lobby with internet access, but since it is popular, expect a short wait and don't expect to be able to spend long on it given others waiting.Several minor complaints about the room...1) Other than the bathrooms, everything is very open, so everyone can hear everything despite the large size2) The TV controllers for the 2 TV's would sometimes affect both TV's. So someone watching TV downstairs, for example, could end up changing the channel or such on the one upstairs. One night, one of our neighbors ending up turning on our TV during the middle of the night while we were asleep.3) The kitchen is locked and they will not allow you access to it.The family room location is literally next door to the main location. It's probably about 30 feet from the lobby entrace to the adjacent entrance. You need a key to get into the adjacent property, and they only have enough keys for one per family, although the front desk is happy to come let you in if the group gets split up.I definitely recommend the hotel for its location and value, especially for families. We would stay here again.

<Content>Great for families with teenagers This was a perfect hotel for a family with two teenagers - we can't stay anywhere with just one room and two double beds anymore. We stayed in a junior suite, which had two rooms - one room with two good sized beds, and a living room with two smaller beds. We picked the hotel on a recommendation from another family with teenagers.The suite was lovely - clean, comfortable, nicely furnished. Couldn't fault it in any way. We didn't have any problem with noise, either. The bathroom was really nice, with a powerful shower!The location is excellent - close enough to La Ramblas (which we found a bit tacky to be honest), and round the corner from a red and blue 'bus touristic' stop - handy if you plan to tour the city this way. The location meant we were able to have a siesta back in the hotel every afternoon, when the heat got too much for us. Also round the corner from an airport bus stop.

<Content>Great stay, would go back again. We stayed in the Cristal Palace for 4 nights. I must admit that there was some noise problem as I could clearly hear people from the next door showering, coughing and spitting. But it only lasted for a while in one night. The rest of the nights were ok so we were fine.The hotel room was huge in European standard, as well as the bathroom. It was clean and modern. It had turn down service at night, which was nice. The staff spoke English well and was generally helpful and friendly. We did have some problem with the TV but they sent someone up to fix it the same day. Location was perfect, just off Las Ramblas.Overall experience was great, with this price for a 3-4 star hotel in Barcelona we would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Less than expected We had reserved a 4 bedded room. Actually they put us in an apartment house adjacent to the hotel where renovations were taking place from early morning throughout the day. The accomodations were adequate but less than advertised.

<Content>Noisy but great location The location is ideal, just a few blocks from Las Ramblas, the Gothic Quarter, and lots of shopping. The neighborhood felt safe and there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance. The accomodations were fine and the room was clean. However, we heard lots of noise in our room every night until about 2 or 3am. The sounds appeared to come from the neighboring building and not from within the hotel. All the noise really put a damper on our stay. Other than that it was a satisfactory stay. On a side note, the hotel offers parking for 16 euros a day.

<Content>Great Location As all mention, you cannot find a better location for exploring the city and I would definately recommend the hotel. However...... the walls of the rooms are PAPER thin and you can hear everything in the room next door. It really is very disturbing! So, if are are a light sleeper OR plan on making a lot of noise... Look elsewhere!

<Content>Solid hotel with central location The best thing about this hotel is its location, as mentioned by numerous previous posts. It is just outside the main tourist areas of Las Ramblas and the Barri Gotic. It is only 2 blocks from the nearest subway station (Passeig de Gracia) and is next door to the Rambla de Catalunya, which has numerous restaurants, cafes, etc. The room we booked, a double, was pretty basic. I would place it as an average size in relation to a New York City hotel, though the bathroom was pretty large. The bathtub also doubled as a jacuzzi. No baclonies are available at this hotel. The staff were all very friendly, and while some has excellent language skills (Spanish, French and English) others were a little more spotty.

<Content>Easter Break Have just stayed at the Cristal Palace Hotel over the Easter Holidays. The Hotel is situated near to Plata de Catalunya Sqaure at the top of the Ramblas. The bus from the airport stops in the square and it is only a five minute walk from there to the hotel. There are plenty of bars, resturants around the square so no need to travel far to eat and drink, and there are 3-4 metro stations around the Hotel. The Hotel itself is in a quite street away from the hussle and bussle. It has large spacious bedrooms and bathroom - and we had three beds in the room but it still didn't feel cramped. The shower was wonderful - very hot and powerful good to wake you up to get back out around the city. Barcelona itself is a fabulous city with so much to do and look at - already looking forward to travelling there again. The tourist bus is great, you can hop on and off all day at all the major sightseeing points - good way to find your bearings.

<Content>Super Hotel We stayed at the Cristal Palace from Dec 25-28 and were very pleased.The room was very high grade. We found it quite clean and with good quality furnishings. The roll-way for our teenage daughter was in place and set-up on our arrival. Front desk is very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast in the restaurant is good and a fair price. Location is excellent: one block off of the Gran Via and Passeig de Gracia. We walked over to Placa de Catalunya with ease (5 minutes) and strolled the Gran Via in the evening. Casa Battlo is an easy walk as well.

<Content>Great Location We stayed 4 days in advance of our cruise, and one day at the end. After reading the reviews before we left I decided to book this hotel. The rates seemed reasonable, although varied during the time of our stay, (btwn E147 - E179, and the location can't be beat. It is on Deputacion, one block from Passaige de Gracia, and one block from Placa Catalunya. Anna at the front desk took very good care of us, but I can't say the rest of the staff was over eager to make one feel welcome. Only one night of our reservtions came with breakfast, but I wouldn't pay for it if I had to. There are plenty of cafes around the area.Our room overlooked the back and was very clean and quiet, although not overbearingly large. The room came with robes (nice touch) and a whirlpool bath. Ask for a room in the back. Our vacation did not start well at the airport upon arrival. We landed in terminal A and our luggage was at terminal B, but no one told us..along with other Americans on the flight.When we asked staff at the airport to point us in the direction of the baggage claim, they did not speak English, nor were they interested in helping. The cab drivers on the all in all do not speak English, and a cab should only cost you around E20-25 to the heart of the city. It cost us E24. Please be aware, that there is a different rate on the weekends (higher), and that they charge you $2 for every bag placed in the trunk. In fact we think the cab driver taking us to the airport on Sunday really took us for a ride even though the traffic was nearly nil, the meter read E3.75 before we drove away from the curb, and the ride back cost us E31.75 with one less bag in the trunk. I think the hotel location was great, but if it is any indication of a European hotel, it was probably pretty good.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Room, Location, Food We stayed at this Hotel in Sepember 2005 for 4 nights, the hotel is in and excellent location just 5 minutes from the square and Rambles away from all the noise yet within striking distance all many superb rrestaurants and bars. The Hotel was very good, rooms air conditioned and well equiped. breakfast was very comprehensive with everything you could ask for. Do try the side streets as they are more spanish and less commercial than Ramblas. Take care in the Port Olympic restaurants as some are a rip off, especially EL Cangrejo Loco, poor food and service. Take the Turistic open buses, 2 day pass and 3 buses will ensure you see all the main area's of Barcelona. A must visit is Gaudi's house.

<Content>Barcelona in August It's been said before, but allow me to reiterate . . . the Hotel Cristal Palace's location is absolutely perfect. We got everywhere really quickly; rarely had to take a taxi. (Only twice, returning from Port Vell/Barceoloneta). We walked right out of the hotel, down two blocks to Placa Catalunya, onto the Ramblas and right down to the Port. The hotel is one block above Gran Via (a primary east-west route, connecting Placa Espanya and Placa Catalunya, and along which the aerobus from the airport runs), and thus, two blocks north of Placa Catalunya. You can catch a bus on Gran Via that runs all the way up Montjuic to the Fundacio Juan Miro. The hotel is Located between Rambla Catalunya (the CALM Rambla) and Passieg de Gracia (main N/S boulevard with Gucci, Chanel, Zara, and spectacular modernisme buildings, including Casa Battlo.) We were no more than two minutes walk to either Placa Catalunya station or Passeig de Gracia station, so that we could connect directly to the four major metro trains in BCN. Also, Passeig de Gracia has a commuter rail station, at which you can the line that goes south to Sitges, for a day trip to a gorgeous beach town. You are also a stone's throw from the BCN tourist center.When we'd go to the old city, and had become pleasantly overwhelmed by the cacaphony, stepping out into L'Eixample was like breathing clean air. And arriving at the Cristal Palace (whose name I could not say without a giggle) and stepping through the strange semi-circular automatic doors, was yet another level of peace. The hotel itself is quite comfortable -- if you, like me, have read all the other reviews, you'll read that there is a tad bit of noise that commingles from room to room, and that the rooms are small, but it's nothing a city dweller isn't used to. The room we stayed in was well planned, with a low and small scale decor and huge, double glazed windows that made it seem much larger. As for street noise, the new windows completely eliminate it. Expect cool polished marble floors throughout, huge bath with double sink, big tub, gentle A/C, freshly ironed linens daily, careful and considerate room service and housekeeping. (If you sleep past noon, your room will still be cleaned.) Most of the guests we met were mature folks (of all ages) and the hotel is set up to handle people keeping all hours. The desk staff speak many languages, and are helpful. I was concerned about privacy in such a small space, and yet I never felt intruded upon. Ice machines would be a nice touch, but you can ask at the desk for a bowl. The hotel has some free newspapers (including the Herald Tribune in English, with an El Pais English insert) located back by the breakfast area. I never did figure out the espresso machine centrally located on our floor across from the lift. Frankly, I don't think it adds to the charm of the hotel. In Barcelona, if you drink coffee, cafe con leche is one of the most sublime pleasures. Why would we give that up for a powdered creamer and coffee from a foil-wrapped tablet?By all means, try the chicken and avocado sandwich via the 24-hour room service. The mini-bar is reasonable! The Pictory resturant on premises is expensive and elegant, and we didn't try it, but one day when we wandered in in search of the chicken sandwich, the waitress was gracious and helpful as she settled us in the bar area and presented us with a room service menu. And THEN we ordered a pitcher of sangria made by the barman in the most skillful way: it was amazing, with spices, anise, fresh fruit, cold: a perfect beverage for a steamy summer BCN afternoon. We didn't do the breakfast -- there's a cafe immediately across the street and another one to the right, as you walk out, where they have fresh-squeezed oj (zumo) and if you ask nicely, they'll make you a cheese omelette. Also, on Passeig de Gracia, on the corner, the Vaca Paca has a 10 euro buffet libre dinner. As we were on a tight budget (spending $1000 each for 12 nights in BCN) we took advantage of it once or twice and it's well worth it. My sister and I spent 12 nights, cheek by jowl in BCN on a limited budget, and felt pampered and protected at the Hotel Cristal Palace. We would surely stay there again, if we have the opportunity.

<Content>loved it, a clean friendly helpfull hote We arrived by taxi from BCA airport (30 euros). I was on holiday with my husband and our two sons. We checked in and were taken to the junior suite in a building next door. The suite was amazing, spacious with two single beds downstairs, 1 shower rooms with a toilet and 1 double bed up a spiral staircase, with a large area for storage and a large bathroom. The suite was very clean with its own adjustable AC and daily maid service. The hotel staff were very helpfull with advise and could all speak english. This hotel is located in the perfect location for shops, cafe's, bars and a 5 minute walk to catalonia square. Ladies look out for deals from the handbag shop opposite the hotel she cuts her prices in the summer by 75%. The metro was just around the corner and it took you every were.

<Content>Enjoyed Cristal Palace Enjoyed recent 3 night trip to this hotel.The room was fine. We had a large private balcony area with a table and chairs which would have been great in summer. You had to be careful closing the sliding window at night otherwise there was a wind noise. We were at the back of the hotel and it was quiet.The breakfast buffet was fine although for those accustomed to a bit of leniency on the closing time or a warning of things disappearing at closing time you wont get that here! Most of the staff were excellent. Enquiries about a restaurant were met with assistance with the reservation, and it was good too. We did encounter a sarcastic, lazy barman. He tried hard not to serve us at all. On return one night he told us the bar was closed despite there being a sign showing it was open for another half hour. He then chatted to the reception staff before condescending to take our money. The other staff deserve a more enthusiastic colleagueThis was good value on my 6th trip to the city staying in a different hotel of similar standard each time. I would stay here again if I am lucky enough to return to this fantastic city.Excellent location walked a lot of places near enough to metro for further travel.

<Content>Watch your wallet  This hotel is in a good location  very quiet. The only problem we had was the maid stealing my mobile phone  money from my wallet. The attitude of the staff when we reported that my stuff has been taken was not very good they thought we were just making it up.This is not a 4 star hotel more like 2 or 3. You will find a better hotel for the same price per night in Barcelona.

<Content>Review of suites The suites were great for a family of 4 with young children (7 and 5). They are in a separate building next to the main building and have their own locked door for security. The suite was two levels with two bathrooms. Upstairs was a loft with a king size bed (two twins pushed together), TV, and bathroom with shower. Downstairs was a sitting area with one twin bed under the stairs. A second twin bed was in an alcove off the hallway from the front door, effectively making it a separate bedroom with its own small bathroom and shower. We all, therefore, had our own rooms which was brilliant.It was clean, in a very central location for all the tourist activities, and had a very good breakfast buffett. We had a rate of 150 euros per night during February.

<Content>average hotel, but not four star I booked a long weekend at this hotel for my husband's 40th birthday. When we arrived we were given a tiny room which overlooked a brick wall and had twin beds. I had booked a double and requested a view. After much argument with the surly reception staff we were given a much better room- it was bigger, had a double bed and a nice little balcony with a table and chairs. The view was not great but we decided it was a vast improvement! The position of this hotel is excellent -it's very central and we walked everywhere. Las Ramblas was within 5 minutres of the hotel. Breakfast was adequate. All in all a decent hotel, but more a 3 star than a 4.

<Content>Great location, good clean hotel Just got back from 4 nights at the Hotel Cristal Palace. Location was excellent, good area near the Placa Catalunya and a lot of the sights not to mention the upmarket shops round the corner. Stayed in Duplex apartment style rooms next to hotel ideal for a family of four. Could probably get a couple of rooms for the same price but we wanted space to relax. Apartments were clean but a bit noisy at night (neighbouring apartments rather than street noise) and upstairs bathroom was a bit smelly but clean. Felt secure. Breakfast average but Good service.

<Content>GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!!! Switched hotels 2 days before we left on our vacation. Very glad I did. We stayed 1 day(June 29) before our 12 day cruise and then again 1 day (July 13) after our cruise. Staff was extremely helpful. No language problem at all. We stayed in there suite. Which was like staying in a loft apartment (without the kitchen). Very very clean hotel. I noticed how the cleaning help dusted everything. The room was a little pricy 275, euros, but considering the size was worth it. Only problem was the first night the air-conditioner went out. Staff was willing to change our room or give us a 20% discount. Can't tell you about the food though, we did not eat at the hotel. Would stay here again .

<Content>Hotel with the world's smallest rooms - ever! I booked this hotel online, looking forward to the 4-star experience. Like the other reviewer, our room was extremely disappointing; tiny and looked out onto 3 concrete walls which meant it was permanently dark. At night, the noise from other guests was annoying. We stayed in March and while the weather outside was pleasant, the heat in the room was unbearable. This hotel is not by any means a 4-star hotel. I would not stay here again and would recommend anyone that there are better hotels in Barcelona that are cheaper and closer to the centre of things.

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, May7-9 for 144 euros/night. Our room was on the 9th floor and is small but we had a nice balcony overlooking some courtyards. The room was extremely quiet and tranquil, and we did not hear any of our neighbors. The hotel is close to many attractions and allowed us to either walk or use the subway. The weather was cool but we did noticed that the air conditioner was functioning. There is a convenient taxi stand across the street from the hotel, which we used to get to the pier. Our plane to Europe was late and we had to run to catch our connecting flight to Barcelona. We made the flight but our luggage didn't. The hotel called Air France 3 times to check on our luggage, which eventually came on the second day (Thank goodness since we were to leave for a cruise on the 9th!). We also had our ATM card stolen and the front desk called our bank so that we could cancel the card. Beware of the ATM-jamming scam where they jam the ATMs and then steal your card! The front desk staff was exceptional and we will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Not bad not fantastic We stayed at the Hotel Cristal palace for 3 nights last week after much hotel surfing. I chose Cristal because there was the option of having a junior suite /duplex (拢120 per night no breakfast) which seemed reasonable. The suite itself was a very decent size with a large living room facing a quiet inner courtyard (better than traffic at front). However there were no tea and coffee making facilities as stated although the receptionist said a waiter would bring us some if required. It was easier to get a cappucino to go from the Taormina bar opposite(good for bottle water, snacks too). The bathroom was clean and modern and had everyting you could wish for but the bedroom was quite tiny. All in all it was a value for money if a little souless hotel. (The suites were in a separate building and away from normal hotel facilities) 5 mins from Placa Catalunya and the Modernist buildings on the Eixample. My best tip for Barcelona? the Tourist Bus which has a Northern and Southern route for same price (20Euros for 2 days) you need hardly use the metro and the buses run every few minutes from P.Catalunya. Take note - everywhere is closed on Mondays except from Nou Camp!
