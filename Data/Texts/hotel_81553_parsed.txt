<Content>Wouldnt stay again We stayed here because they had a cheap park and fly package. The rooms are old and gross. The bathroom has mold in it, the carpets are filthy, the pillows are as thin as paper and the comforter had burn holes in it, even though we were in a non-smoking room. The blankets has gigantic tears in them. The springs in the bed also poke you in your back all night long. The staff needs a lesson in customer service because they are really rude. The only good thing about this motel is that you can park your car there and a shuttle takes you to the airport, and then brings you back to your car.

<Content>You ought to be able to do better This is a very basic hotel. It is right next to the freeway on one side and a busy road to the airport on the other. The hotel is a basic motel style and the rooms are very tired. The only positive I can think of is that it is close to the airport but as I say above I am sure you can do better for the same money.

<Content>improved, and surprisingly a good value for what i wanted! iam a professional travel agent with over 20 years in the industry, i was looking for decent hoteldigs with a free shuttleto and from the airport and i was not disappointed, the price was right, AARP discount given!, and the room was very clean, all i needed, in good repair, and everything worked, the shower stall was very large and ample and good water pressure and good hot water, the room did have a slightly musty smell but thats because none of the windows open, so i aired out the roomfor a few hours with the door open and all was fine, otherwise this was a good value, staff were correct and even kind and forthcoming, when i needed a later check out that was possible and when i needed t o stay a bit in their lobby pending their departure itwas most comfy with nice staff, the shuttle comes for free often and nice drivers, dont forget to give them a littletip, they need an d deserve it, the IHOP next store is not bad, but a lot of artificial food, not even butter but trans fat laden margerine illegal in other parts of the country to serve, ( illegalto serve in nYC !)., but ok for closeness, the ripbs and chicken dinner were surprisingly tasty !., , over all i would highly rcommend this if you are on a budget and want something near the airport and clean and direct, good shuttle service, if igo to sfo again i will def. stay there again ! even the gardens were cute, try to get a room closer to the lobby as otherwise a small bit of walking but even that not bad, poolwas also nice, if the weather cooperates, iwould def. recommend this property based on what i saw in nov., 2008 !, as far as i know the least price for the most in the area!

<Content>Worried for nothing !! I booked through Hotwire back in January and after reading all the recent reviews was wondering if I'd made a big mistake. Our flight was 7.30am on a Monday so we didn't want to risk getting stuck in downtown traffic in rush hour so chose to book the cheapest hotel near to the airport with a free shuttle for our last night in the USAWe were once again greeted with a friendly smile and checked in quickly, the guy gave us a room overlooking the pool ( first sigh of relief , I knew other blocks were noisy and advice on Trip was to ask for a room near reception) , pity the weather had turned cooler for our last day in San Francisco. He asked if we needed a wake up call and arranged it and also what time shuttle we required. We were surprised to see that the shuttles start running at 4.00AM .The room was 106, it was clean, had everything we needed and had a huge walk in shower, the best bathroom out of all the hotels we had stayed in on this trip.Granted there was a little rust here and there but it wasn't going to kill us !!We went to the IHOP for something to eat and had a breakfast that had fruit pancakes on special. We found nothing wrong at all with the service or the food. We slept well even though we were right by where people were passing from reception to other blocks.IF we had an early flight again from SFO and could guarantee staying in that same block we would stay here again. For the money it was perfect for our requirements .

<Content>Cheap and That is About It The property is cheap and close to the 101 freeway. The problems, however, outweigh the cost factor. The rooms smell like old motel rooms (musty). There is a homeless woman that roams the corridors all day, which is not for the weak of heart. The front desk does not answer the phone at all. When I tried to call twice to get a wake up call, no one answered at all. I had to wait in line at the front desk, watching them ignore all the other icoming calls. This is a bad Travelodge rendition and a bad place to stay unless you are strapped for cash.

<Content>Worst experiance ever! Most awful place I have ever seen! This place makes horror movies seem like Disneyland! The staff lied to us. They told us we could be refunded for the night we were not going to stay there if we talked to Priceline about it and then when Priceline called to confirm the same guy refused to refund the money. Mold, sewer smell, stained carpets, bugs and much more. I posted a descriptive detailed account on my blog if you are interested in reading more. http://todayinthelifeof.com/blog/?p=38 Do not stay or you will regret it! The Marriot Courtyard is not much more expensive and is a billion times better. Like night and day!

<Content>Comfortable, Cheap and Clean My husband and I wanted to stay in the Bay area without costing us an arm and a leg...maybe a second mortgage. It was affordable, especially on AARP rates. The room was dated and there were a few little cosmetic problems, but it was clean, quiet and perfect if all you are looking for is a shower and a bed. Let's face it, how much time do we spend in the hotel/motel room anyway? The bed was comfortable and the bedding was perfect...not too much or too little. The staff was friendly. The motel cats were very cute, too. We stayed two nights and plan on staying there again.Now the IHOP next door....forget it the food was lousy.

Only a couple of TV channels worked, and the room was a bit noisy; no breakfast either. If you want a no-frills cheap park-and-fly deal this is it.

<Content>Very Bad Customer Service - Very Very Bad I called this hotel a day in advance to authorize my friend to go into my room before I arrived. I left them a voicemail message giving my confirmation number, name, and my friends name, stating in the message that he is to be let into my room before I arrive. On the day of my reservation date, the front desk would not allow my friend into my room. I contacted Hotels.com and they advised they put the information into the computer and that it was available to the hotel in the notes section. They still would not allow my friend into my room. I contacted the hotel directly and spoke to them and they still would not allow my friend into my room without Hotels.com faxing them information. This is [--]! I will NEVER EVER use this hotel again and I will let all my friends and associates know not to use them either and why. POOR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN!!!

<Content>MUCH Better than Previous Reviews My wife booked herself for 3 nights and when I learned how inexpensive it was ($49 a night!) I was amazed -- you can't get that in San Francisco anywhere. Of course, I was concerned.When I looked at the reviews here, I was even more anxious.But, after spending over an hour looking at the other (nearby hotels), and then finding out they were booked -- we were prepared for the worst.My wife called the hotel to cancel, but she was late by 5 minutes. So she voiced her concerns, sharing what she had read here. The receptionist assured her she would be fine. Thanks to a review here, she asked for a REMODELED room, and the receptionist said she would get one for her.Arrival was fine. A shuttle picked her up promptly (one arrives at the airport every 30 minutes). Someone else checked my wife in, and she was very satisfied. The hotel is next door to an IHOP so that was convenient. The room was clean and quiet. Obviously, if you're expecting an upscale hotel, this is not something you're looking for. But for the price, and the purpose (a business meeting at a nearby hotel), you will be just fine.

<Content>More like a motel than a hotel We were on a tight budget and wanted to stay at a cheap rate on Priceline for Memorial 3 Day weekend in SF. Considering this hotel offers some of the cheapest rates, I agree with the other viewers that we got what we paid for. The buildings and room are old. It feels more like a motel than a hotel. There aren't many hotel staff around, and there appears to be renters there. It's close to the airport, and has free parking, and Samtrans line 292 out front that runs into SF. However, the neighborhood does not appear to be the safest. We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel/area, only a place to sleep.

<Content>Never Again We were looking for an inexpensive ParkandFly. The Travelodge was cheap. We got what we paid for. The room was shabby, the management indifferent. The worst was the 40 minute wait for the shuttle from the airport. Every other hotel's shuttle came by twice. We didn't get an apology or an explanation. Not worth the money we saved.

<Content>Liked the room for my last night in SFO I was staying in Travelodge my last night before flight out of here in SFO. I got lucky and got the remodeled room. The room was nice, but not a Holiday Inn or Marriott room. The traffic was annoying, maybe they need some soundproof rooms. A little bit of mold was in the bathroom. Plus, if you got a great price from Hotwire or Pricelice, you will pay for breakfast instead of getting breakfast credit at IHOP.If you need to the room before flight out and have little money, call Travelodge Airport North

<Content>Mixed experiences OK, the Ritz-Carlton it's not. On the plus side, these are probably the largest rooms for the money in the area; it's just a few minutes by shuttle or car from SFO; freeway access is immediately adjacent; and there are adequate dining options nearby. The downside is that this hotel has been around for -- no kidding -- 50 years at this point and a lot of the rooms are definitely showing their age. Maintenance and repair work in some of them has very clearly been done by untrained or minimally-trained employees. If as another reviewer said the front desk staff has been rude, I think I know exactly which person they're talking about; most of the staff I've dealt with, however (I've stayed here several times) are actually quite pleasant.

<Content>Learned what my standards were In the fall of 2006, my husband and I decided to go on a last-minute trip to San Francisco. We tried to go for best value for the money spent, so we picked this Travelodge as our hotel, thinking how bad can it be, it's a national chain hotel? I figured it wouldn't have stellar accommodations, but that it would be an acceptable place to sleep after exploring the city, which was the impression I got from many of the reviews on Expedia.After we checked in, I could tell this hotel was not meeting expectations and I began to feel uncomfortable. The buildings looked outdated and a little run-down; all the rooms opened to the outside and there were people hanging out and talking loudly in the middle of the night. The doors had heavy-duty locks and a notice telling guests to use them at night. The rooms were clean enough, but there were some stains on the carpet and walls. On top of all that, the beds were quite uncomfortable, and needless to say, I didn't get much sleep the first night we were there.The next day, I realized that staying the rest of our trip at this hotel would damper the quality of the vacation for me. My husband had similar feelings, though not quite as strong as mine, and agreed to look for a different hotel. We ended up staying the next three nights at the Best Western Grosvenor, which was right across the street, and felt like a luxury hotel compared to this one - and for only $75 a night, with a coupon we found from one of the tourist newspapers. We weren't able to recoup the cost of the Travelodge, because we booked it in a package with Expedia, but it was still well worth eating the money and paying for a better hotel to stay at. After our experience staying here, my husband and I agreed that we will never again stay at a motel - only hotels - and will thoroughly check traveler reviews before booking accommodations.

<Content>I Took the Loss I booked three nights at this crummy hotel hoping to save a buck with a $39 a night booking through Hotwire. What a mistake. After learning that it was this hotel that I'd purchase, my research at this site and others was pretty much spot on. The hotel looks run down and sits right on the busy 101 freeway. There were several folks milling around who obviously rented rooms on a long-term basis which is always a little sketchy. The room was a big disappointment in so far as the mattresses and box springs looked like they'd were purchased third-hand and then dirtied up a bit for good measure. The bathroom was slightly better but no much more. Absolutely disgusting. Now you might ask, what do you expect for $39 a night in a two star hotel? Well, safety and sanitary beds are the bare minimum that any hotel should provide. I stuck it out one night and took the loss and booked a three star room through Priceline at the Doubletree paying $70 per night (plus $15 parking). It was well worth it. I will never skimp on a clean, good night's sleep again. Just not worth it.

<Content>Trashy hotel This Travelodge was hard to be reached over the phone, and I should have took the clue. The front desk was rude and the hotel was terrible. It felt dirty and unsafe. I stayed the night in the building farthest from the lobby and many people appeared to be living in some of the rooms and were socializing on the sidewalk and curbs at midnight. I used this hotel to store my vehicle for a trip and used their shuttle contract. The parking was moderately better than the hotel and my vehicle was untouched when I returned a week later. The shuttle service was on time and friendly. I do not advise anyone to stay here.

<Content>This place is a dump If you're considering paying over $50 don't unless you have to stay near the airport and can't find anything else comparable in price. I paid $38 through Hotwire and I didn't think it was worth it.The hotel is dirty, run down, hard to navigate, and very noisy. Our room in building was 80' from the freeway and is separated by some flimsy trees. The freeway traffic, coupled with the airplanes landing/taking off makes for one very noisy stay.The hotel is poorly lit and if you're staying on the side facing the freeway then you may have difficulty driving through the narrow pathways to park your car at your room. The shower floor in my room was dirty, the blanket was dirty, the carpet was dirty and even had a cigarette butt still lying on the carpet even though the room had been cleaned.The staff was friendly but I still don't recommend this place to anyone.FYI: The attached restaurant is an IHOP.

<Content>Money is the game Of course, I usually am afraid to read hotel reviews before I go because for every 3 people that liked it, there are 5 who give it a horrid review. So I have to admit that I was leery when I stayed at this Travelodge. The location is very close to airport and convenient. The rooms are adequate. It's an older hotel but for the price, the value is good. The staff seemed pretty nice and I thought that the cleaning staff did a great job of cleaning the room. I was impressed to find that certain details that budget motels usually forget were not at this Travelodge. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. If you want luxury, this is definitely not it but if you would like to stay somewhere that is inexpensive in an expensive city, then this would be a good bet for you.

<Content>Only stay here if you get it dirt cheap... I needed a place to stay in between up here before I started a new job.I got the room from priceline for $29 a night. Dirt cheap. Free shuttle to the airport and as someone mentioned, next to an ihop if you don't have a car or anything.The first night I arrived, I checked out the room and they gave me a smoker's room. I had to go back to the front desk to tell them that I wasn't a smoker. For one night, maybe. But I was staying on for a weak and a half. Fortunately, the person at the front desk was kind enough to change it to a non-smoking room.It is a very convenient location. But the rooms are in a terrible condition. My toilet would not stop filling up in the tank, so it made a lot of noise.If you want a cheap place to stay and are not concerned with amenities, then this is the place. Personally, I now regret not staying at one of the hostels. They are just as cheap and much higher in quality than this place.Live and learn...

<Content>Ok for the money We used Hotwire  paid $38 per night ($45 with taxes and fees)  it was good value based on this price. Convenient, close to freeway  airport, clean enough, ok room. Downside is that it's somewhat noisy being right next to the freeway. This is nothing fancy, but if you just need a room for a night or two, it's just fine (particularly if you can get it for this price!)

<Content>Worst hotel ever This hotel is easily the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in. We stayed there in early October 2007, this was mainly due to the 55 per night price. Upon arrival at reception there was a gentleman tryiing to book and was informed that it was sold out. So it hought maybe this is alright. How wrong I was.Our room was located nearly 1/2 mile away from reception and foolishly to save a few bucks did not accept a bag handler to assist especially as our room was on the second level and there are no lifts, so carting 5 luggage was not pleasant. Our room stunk of cigarettes especially as I requested non smoking. My wife was laying on top of the bed next to mine and discovered ear ring remnrants on top of the bed. The facilities were aged, it was noisy from both the airplanes and the freeway next door.We could not sleep on the sheets and slept on the 2nd layer as we were afraid of the condition of the sheets and finally I got bitten by bed bugs on my neck for the first time in my life. I could not wait to get out of there. People if you are wondering about this hotel, consider strongly at spending 20 or 30 extra and stay somewhere a bit more descent than this.

Our luggage was delivered ahead of us, because we were bumped off our flight, and the hotel kept our bags in a locked room. For $40/night per room from Orbitz, we got exactly what we wanted. The IHop next door had slow service, but the food, while pricey, was well-prepared.We were able to log into free WiFi from our room, without the hassle of passwords.We could have easily spent twice as much... but why?

<Content>Get what you pay for We have stayed twice at the SFO Travelodge Airport North as we got a bargain rate on hotwire ($43)  wanted to pay as little as possible to stay near the airport to catch an early flight.The shuttle bus runs regularly  from early in the morning. It's not the Ritz, but for $43, it's great value. At least there's a coffee maker, unlike some 3 star hotels I've stayed in recently  paid much more for. I've already booked 2 more stays for Dec  Jan to get early morning flights  would recommend this to people who want somewhere cheap  near the airport. There's an IHOP on the site  a McDonalds across the road so if you don't like greasy food it might be best to eat before you arrive. I've just booked 3 nights at the Mayflower Renaissance in Washington for $409 per night plus tax (my company is paying  they insist I stay there) so I'll expect more luxury, but as I keep saying I think for $43 this place is fine.

Very run-down, terrible beds, bad lighting in bathroom and only a few channels on the TV. Room was very small and carpets stained. All in all, not really that cheap so should have paid just a few dollars more and stayed somewhere else. I booked the hotel based on the photos on their site-obviously the photos are outdated!Listen to the reviewers-don't stay here.

<Content>You get what you pay for . . . We stayed in this motel to fly in and out of San Francisco airport. We only paid $59.00/night. I would not pay one penny more to stay at this motel.The beds are the least comfortable I have ever experienced and both times we stayed there the sheets kept coming off during the night. We did not sleep well either nights.I put my credit card in the computer in the lobby to check the internet, the service never worked. Wouldn't recommend that service.I never got coupons for breakfast. We actually ate at the attached IHOP and it was very nice. No one at the hotel said we could have received coupons. Hmmmm.You need a car to stay here. It is a resort style with rooms spready out all over the complex. I'm sure if we were walking it would have taken us 5 minutes to walk to our room. I would recommend people with cars only.The location is very close to the airport, so that's a plus.In summary, you get what you pay for. We were looking for inexpensive accommodation and that's what we received. If I had it to do over again, I would pay a little more, there are plenty of other motels/hotels in the area.

The walls were paper thin and I could hear everything in the next room. Worse yet, it's right next to a freeway and there was road noise, plus it's very close to the airport and under the flight path, so there was constant plane noise. I barely slept.

<Content>Excellent motel, if you are not looking for anything fancy My boyfriend and I stayed at this motel mid-July of 2007 for 5 days. At first we picks this motel cause it was close to downtown and it wasn't expensive. We would rather spend more on other stuff than at a fancy hotel. Well, we decided to book the suite with the King size bed with micro/frig. Huge room, big bed, as a matter of fact, they even have sofa bed (just in case u have guests, I guess) . The housekeeping is great, we got clean sheets and towels every day. Bathroom was spacious, good enough bathtub and shower, lighting was ok. The staff was polite and the place is pretty peaceful. Parking was very convenience, we parked our car right outside of our room. The wireless internet was fast and reliable! Both my boyfriend and I brought our laptop, and neither of us had a problem going online. The IHOP next door open 24 hours a day, which was very convenient, since I am the kind of person that love to snack. N they have a Chevron right next door too, which was great; since we only fuel up @ Chevron!In general, my experience with this motel is quite awesome. I will definately stay there again if we decide to go up north again.

<Content>The worst place I have ever stayed... We only stayed here one night and I'm so glad it wasn't any longer. I would have forfeited my money and went elsewhere. We had 3 rooms booked and because of an error in booking we ended up with 3 smoking rooms. Now I don't now if the non-smoking rooms are better but...Out of the three rooms only one of the toilets worked. 2 were blocked and we had to go into another room if we needed to go. The rooms were dirty with a bad smell (but probably from the cigarettes) and the fly screens on the windows were ripped and the window didn't lock. I wasn't leaving anything in the room. We weren't given enough towels and when we asked at reception for more they have none left! The wi-fi was not working until I went and complained at reception and then 20 minutes later I was disconnected again. The coke machine was not working and took my money and when I went to tell the staff they said they were not their problem, that they were run by an independent company. Speaking of the staff they were very unhelpful with everything and not very friendly. I have stayed in hostels before that have been of better quality. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone or ever stay here again. I would rather sleep in the street or better yet in the airport!!

<Content>Certainly nothing fancy, but OK I read some reviews here after I booked this hotel and was scared! However, the room was clean, not smokey, large, the bed was OK. The bathroom was pretty tiny and shower pressure wasn't that great but certainly nothing terrible. Parking was convenient and cheap for the area. The shuttle was convenient and seems to run pretty frequently by SFO. I wouldn't book here for pleasure but if I had an early am flight (as I did this time), I would be OK staying here again.

<Content>The breakfast scam Facing facts we booked this place because it was cheap, but it's cheap for a reason. The room was in a serious need of renovations, there was chewing gum on the carpet and the bathroom was in an poor state. The bedroom was a good size but at the cost of a tiny bathroom. It was at least fairly quiet despite being very close to the airport and interstate. What really annoyed us was the breakfast con. I wish I had read the previous reviews on this website which points out however many guest per room it's ONE coupon per room for ONE breakfast from a rather uninspiring selection at the IHOP, drink NOT included. Poor. This was particularly bad as we paid extra to get the breakfast, and in hindsight more than the breakfast was worth. Ended up paying for an additional breakfast each and then went back to the room to make coffee. Just left feeling cheated.

<Content>Bare Necessities Other than the fact that it is old, there was nothing wrong with this motel or our stay. At the rate we got, it would be difficult to complain about anything. Basically, it allowed us a 3-night stay in SF, for the same price most other places charged per night. We decided we would rather spend our money in San Francisco, not on the hotel. Also, it was not a far drive to downtown SF at all.With that said, it was clean, quiet, and the staff was EXTREMELY helpful. Coming from LA, we were very unfamiliar with SF, and the people at the front desk were always ready to help and never impatient.The room did have everything we needed, nothing more, nothing less. The bathroom smelled of cigarettes, and the room could use some updating, but like I said-- for the price we paid, it was no problem. I would stay here again if I got the same low rate.

<Content>Don't stay here until they finish remodeling Stayed at the Travelodge SF Airport North for one night with the family and booked it because of the price. DO NOT stay here until they finish remodeling! There was mold and mildew on the bathroom door and all around the bathtub, the carpet and floor had gaps where it met the wall and overall, the place was dirty and old. Definitely in need of remodeling. There was some remodeling going on, so maybe in the future, this would be a good place to stay. There was also a draft problem, as the door had a big gap around it, letting in outside noise and air from the outside. If I had to do it all over, I would have spent more and stayed somewhere nicer. I was afraid to let my kids let anything drop on the floor. It really was disgusting!

<Content>Stayed over a month - nice We stayed for a month while our place was being remodeled. Got a large King with micro/frig. Big bed, big room. Looked remodelled. They are remodelling and yes there is furniture everywhere. The housekeeping is so good - clean sheets and towels every day for a month! I'm moving in. The lobby staff overall very nice. Jose is very knowledge, other guy is winging it. The ladies are very nice and helpful. Staff at IHOP next door got to know us and comped items. Everything was clean, quiet. I recommend you stay in single story area. The double story ones looked crowded and noisey and rooms not updated.

<Content>Yuk! We have been travelling in the USA for about 10 weeks now and stayed in some good and bad hotels, but this is definitely the WORST. When we arrived they told us there was only one room left in the (huge, deserted) property, a smoking king. We reluctantly agreed and requested a rollaway for our son. The room was disgusting (smelled bad, ripped carpet, dirty floor etc), but by then we had no choice but to stay. When the rollaway hadn't arrived by 5.30pm we asked at the front desk and they said they couldn't get us one because housekeeping had left for the day. I got irate, so they magically found us a non-smoking room with 2 queens. This was great, but the new room was still really smelly. Our son spilled some water on the floor and we mopped it up with a hand towel - the towel ended up a disgusting smelly dark brown colour. They really need to clean their carpets!! Also, there are stacks of old furniture lying around outside. On a positive note: Their coin laundry is relatively clean and in good working order, and their wireless internet connection works fine. Oh, and it's cheap of course, but we've stayed in much better and cleaner hotels for the money.

<Content>Travelodge SF North "Free Breakfast" We booked lodging via Cheaprooms.com at the Travelodge SanFrancisco Airport (North), located on 326 S. Airport Blvd. The advertisement stated Full Breakfast Provided. When we asked the night clerk about breakfast coupons, he indicated we would need to wait until the morning to receive the coupons. Travelodge does not provide breakfast at the hotel, the coupons are used at the nearby IHOP. We were told by the Travelodge representative only one breakfast coupon is provided. The total number of our party was two. When we questioned one coupon and told him our booking advertised 鈥渂reakfast included鈥?, we were told there is nothing I can do. Actually the Travelodge representative was rude and arrogantt. I have until this occurrence never been told by a hotel breakfast that only one breakfast is provided. Our booking was one night, two people to occupy the room.  We ended up using the coupon we were provided at the IHOP next door. We mentioned to the IHOP staff we didn't understand why Travelodge only provided one coupon, and they quickly responded this is a frequent complaint they hear about the Travelodge Airport North. While the amount of the breakfast was a small amount, the larger issue is that free breakfast is advertised as being provided, it does not indicate breakfast for one or any limited numbers or caveats. Any traveler to this hotel should be forewarned this hotel does not provide more than one breakfast coupon, so if your booking with two or more individuals only one coupon is provided.

<Content>Friendly, quiet, great shuttle service Room was clean  comfortable. Internet costs per day and is in small lobby, access with credit card only. IHOP on property, not much else around if no car. Bus stop across street. Great shuttle service  drivers. Used shuttle to get back  forth to BART at the airport. Pool closed already (early Nov). Very large shower, no tub. Quiet where we were. Not much selection on TV, hotel info was out-of-date on their tv channel. Pleasant stay of a week. Friendly staff. Would stay here again.

<Content>This hotel is OK This hotel is actually OK. We stayed here for 1 night on our way home from Hawaii. Its about 10mins from SFO airport and about $10 in a taxi. The rooms are fairly large, although they are basic and in need of upgrading, but they seemed clean enough. They also provide a free shuttle service to the airport which we found very helpful. It also has a nice restaurant next door which is open 24hours. Im not sure id stay here again, though I'd recommend this place to budget travellers or for a short term stay as its very cheap.

<Content>Bed Bug Attack I stayed at this hotel on 13 Oct 2006 as it offered an airport shuttle service. Our room had a disgusting smell but as we had alot of luggage and no transport, we decided to stay for the night. This was a huge mistake as I tossed and turned all night, when I got up in the morning I was covered with bites. These bites have now turned into large welts all over my body. They are extremely itchy! I cant believe that a place like this is allowed to continue to do business. I have lodged a complaint with Travelodge but I genuinely feel that this place should be closed down! It is not fit for humans.

<Content>Don't stay if you need the Internet Travelodge doesn't have highspeed Internet in rooms. Dialup service only and they charge 75 cents per connection, plus 10 cents a minute after 20 minutes. Motel setup is convenient if you like to park directly in front of your door. IHOP next door is convenient and open 24 hours. Lack of Internet and high charge for local calls means I won't be staying again.

<Content>A bit run-down We wanted an airport hotel for our final night in California and chose the Travelodge via the internet. Although close to the airport it is also close to Interstate 101 - in fact right on the highway and traffic noise was intrusive. The hotel fulfilled our needs for one night but was a bit run-down (despite claims on the web-site of a recent facelift) and could do with complete refurbishment. As the on-line charge was just $52 plus tax for the night I suppose I shouldn't complain! Close to an IHOP restaurant and with a complementary airport shuttle. OK - but I would choose an alternative hotel next time!

<Content>Good basic motel My husband and I stayed at the Travelodge as part of a last minute Site 59 weekend getaway. Since the package price was pretty cheap, I estimate that the motel cost less than $50.00 per night. The motel and grounds are in need of renovation, but our room was quite clean. We liked the large shower and didn't miss a tub. The staff swept the parking lot and the walkways daily. We found the staff pleasant and helpful. Some of the motel has two stories, we were in a section that had one story. It was very convenient to park our rental car right outside our window. The location was a real bonus - easy access to route 280 and 101. We spent two days visiting the city (@ 20 minutes away) and three other days exploring the coast and hill towns. The airport noise and traffic did not bother us as others have mentioned. This was an inexpensive, decent place to sleep after a long day of sightseeing, nothing more.
