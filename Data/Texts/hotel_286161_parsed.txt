<Content>OK, for the money This is a cheapish pension in a very central location.It has no elevator so I wouldn't recommend it to handicapped or elderly persons. You might want to ask for a room facing the yard, since rooms with a view to the street can get noisy especially during weekends - at least in summertime the streets will be full of drunken youngsters.Service was nice and I really can't think of anything to complain.Just remember, it is a budget pension. Not a classy hotel.

<Content>Cheap place to sleep but nothing more We stayed at Pension Dali for 3 nights durig our Spain trip. The good things about this place are:1. Great location2. Nice stuff3. Low priceThe less nice points are:1. The room and the bathroom were very small.2. The room and the bath were not very spruce but generally clean.3. The street is pretty noisy at night. We were Ok with it, but generally it is a disadvantage.4. There are long and very steep stairs and no elevator. Take it into concideration when you are packing you luggage.Generally I can reccomend this hostel for young and singles who are not aware of luxury and comfortableness.

<Content>Depends what you are used to. Stayed in this hotel on a driving trip From Uk to South spain. Stayed one night to spend a Saturday in Barcelona  Leave Sunday morning. Only got about an hours sleep, noise was horrendous ! People in the hotel and outside it continued all night. Room was very basic but sort of clean. Do not stay here if you can afford and are used to better. But if on a shoe string and can sleep through an earthquake then i guess it may be o.k.

<Content>OK for youngin's, not for me! We thought we were booking a cheap hotel, but got a hostel instead! The location was great, but the room was little more than utilitarian. The beadspread was dingy and could have used a washing. We also found a sock drowning in dust under the bed. We were glad we had a room with its own bathroom, although the shower drained really slowwwww. As for ambiance...I felt like I was in a shoebox at a fraternity.

<Content>Great location, great buy! We read many reviews before selecting the Pension Dali for our two nights in Barcelona before departing on a trans-Atlantic cruise. Don't expect the Ritz. It's not fancy. It's an old, perhaps very old, building. There is no breakfast. Do expect a reasonably priced, clean and wonderfully located place to sleep. The check-in was flawless. The front desk was always staffed with someone who understood English. The room was clean. The bed comfortable. The bath servicable. There was a TV, but we don't watch on vacation. Our room was on the second floor over the side street and I was concerned about noise, but needn't have been. It was quiet after 10:00 p.m. The hotel is a block from a metro station (the only way to get around). Easy walking distance to the cathedral, shops, wonderful restaurants. It's less than 100 feet off the Rambla. If you're picky, pick something else, but if you want a well located place to lay your head, this is it.

<Content>ummmmmm...... We stayed at pension dali for 2 nights as part of a hen weekend. Was certainly not expecting much from a 2* hostel but was still disappointed. Will admit that sheets and towels were clean and good location. Room was small and cramped, floor in bathroom had a hole in the bottom which filled with water and overflowed, hairs in bath and dirty sink. Could not see anything from window due to thick greenmeshing which made the room extremely dull. Friends had credit cards stolen from their room and we were informed from reception that the only other person with a key was the cleaner. Reception worn and tatty. Would not stay again.

<Content>Great hotel, much better than expected Was really surprised when we were checking into this hotel as the price was reasonable considering you were 5 seconds from the Ramblars and we actually thought it was going to be horrible but alas, thankfully we were wrong.The hotel receptionist was an English bloke and very helpful. The room was a good size as there was 3 of us and very clean and tidy. The room had a fan in the ceiling to keep the room cool and the shower pressure in the bathroom was great.We thought it would be really noisy as you are so close to the main street but the only noise was from our neighbours knocking at the wrong door during the night.All in all great location and good hotel for what you pay for. We did 6 weeks of travelling and got much worse for alot more money. Recommended.

<Content>Big No-No Stayed there for 5 hours. Hours, not days. The room (for 4, supposed to be the best one they had, because it had its own bathroom...) was quite small and dirty. The air was unbreathable, the noise was disturbing, there were no outlets on the walls. I wonder how it got its two stars. There was a promiscous atmosphere at the hotel that made me think I don't want to leave anything in the room...And on top of all that, when we left the guy at the desk tried to ask for more money...IMHO this is a place to avoid... Barcelona has a good metro network, so you don't have to bee in the center in order to have fun ;)

<Content>The staff was really helpful I and my bf have just returned from a week in Barcelona. We decided to stay at Pension Dali, mostly because of the price and the location of course. We didn't expect much from the hotel and that's why we didn't get disappointed.We arrived 2 hours too early in hope to at least be able to leave the bags, but at our surprise we were given the key to the room immediately.The room was pretty nice and the beds were comfortable. Actually the most important to me was the cleanness and although the hotel needed a renovation the room itself was clean and the sheets as well as the towels smelled good.I haven't noticed any insects or anything disgusting, whatsoever, and that made me very happy!One thing worth mentioning was the staff that was really friendly and helpful. We had a few nice conversations with them, especially with an Argentininian guy. Anyways, I think I would recommend this hotel to ppl who are not very picky and travel to enjoy the environment and not the hotels.I think I could come back here...

<Content>Good value This hotel was absolutly fine. Its an average hotel, if you go here expecting the Ritz then you will be very disapointed, but go there being realistic and you will have a great time. the rooms are a decant size, the staff were very friendly and the location couldnt of been better.Yes at night time its a little noisy, but when you look at the location its not that surprising. When i was there i spent little time in the room as i was to busy seeing the sights and sounds of Barcelona, and as somewhere to spend the night, get washed and changed, this hotel is excellant and very reasonabley priced.I would ceetainly stay here again without question!

<Content>stay away unless you are on a very tight budget and cannot bear to be more than 50 metres away from the ramblas then give this hole a miss. the place does not feel safe or clean. one night i saw some guy off the street who had some how got the money togrther booking a room for the night, this did not make us feel very safe at all. hotels that allow tramps and people who sleep rough on the streets to book in, are in my book to be avoided at all costs. look a little bit further away from the ramblas and pay the same money for a decent hotel.

<Content>Basic and different myself  my wife stayed here in nov.  we had a ball. The boys in reception were great very helpful  great fun. The room was very basic but it didn't cost alot so thats ok, it had a tv, its own bathroom  was cleaned everyday. The lift to say the least was rare, it rattled it banged  it shook but it worked  we found it an experience. We would stay there again, if you want cheep  basic this is the place, if you want to treat yourself splash out on an hotel. Aidan  Susan Ireland.

<Content>Very basic but did the job nicely Me and my boyfriend stayed here at the start of August. Our room was extremely basic and small, our bathroom was outide of the room but luckily we were the only people using that particular toilet. The man on reception was very nice and friendly and made us feel welcome. We only paid 拢17 a night so it was well worth it, and being right in the heart of everything, a basic room is what i'd expect and it did the job! We booked online thtough [---] and had no problems with it. I'd definitely stay there again with it being such a bargain.

<Content>Worst Hotel - Ever! This was by far the worst lodging experience I have ever had, anywhere. I had reserved a room for one night, received confirmation and had at a later date extend my reservation by two days. They lost the reservation for the final two days of my stay. That turned out to be a blessing, though they did nothing to try and help me find alternate reservations. Then again, I would not have trusted any suggestion they made.This was the only hotel during my stay in Spain where I felt the need to put a chair (and the table) in front of my door when I went to bed. The room was not clean, the bathroom was beyond filthy. The shower did not drain and by the time the water was hot the shower pan was almost overflowing. There was only one electrical outlet, in the bathroom.The only thing this place has going for it is location and that alone is not a selling point for me. The pictures make this place look so much better than it is.

<Content>Horrible place, avoid at all costs We were supposed to stay here for three nights, but only stayed one. My husband and I have stayed in some pretty utilitarian places over the years, but this was by far the worst. We have never cancelled a reservation after seeing the condition of the accommodations, so this was a first for us.I guess our first clue should have come when we had a really hard time making a reservation. The reason it was so difficult, is because the e-mail address on the pension's site was no longer operational. I finally had to call, and then the front desk person provided me with a functional e-mail address. It would not have taken much effort to update the web site. Last time I checked, the incorrect address is still listed on the site.The room only had one electrical outlet, and this was in the bathroom. Forget plugging in a computer, or any other device for that matter. In addition, we were told that internet service was available in the lobby but, when we got there, we were told that they used to have it but it's been broken for a while and needs to be fixed.If we hadn't brought ear plugs, we wouldn't have gotten any sleep. The noise from outside was constant until about 4 or 5:00am.The location is appealing, but there are lots of hotels and pensions near la Rambla, so the Pension Dali is not unique in this regard, and its location alone would be no reason to book here. Also, there's really nothing about Dali that is reflected in the pension, except a picture of him that hangs over the front desk.Some of the front desk people acted like we were a bother, for example, the one that was sleeping on the couch when we went downstairs.While the room smelled strongly of bleach, there was mold growing on the toilet tank and between the shower tiles. There was also a pile of dirt under the radiator, which suggested that the room hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in quite some time. The tub was so small, we kept feeling like we were going to slip and fall if we moved.The price for a double room with private bathroom was 59 Euros per night, which is approximately $74.00. The room we got was worth maybe (MAYBE!) 30 Euros per night ($38).

<Content>Do not go there! Horrible!! My husband and I stayed at this hotel...now we are young, easy-going people that have stayed at hostels before, but this one was the worst of all! Smelly, small!! Beds are hard as a rock.....the lady at the front desk, while smiling, was not helpful...there is no breakfast provided to the guests (contrary to what they claim) and the bathrooms reek! I will never return to this hostel....the only advantage is its location....that's it! Not worth the 50-something euros they charge per night.....

<Content>50 metres from The Ramblas We stayed here for 3 days in early May 2006.This hotel has the best location possible for walking the Ramblas and the back streets of Barcelona. Took a little bit of effort to find - but after we bought a map it was easy and worth it.Excellent staff are on hand 24hrs a day. English was not a problem and they gave us great advice about Barcelona.Our room was on the 2nd floor and looked out over a pedestrian alley. A little noisy on one night - but the local soccer team had just won the league - so I don't think that was a sign that it was a normally noisy room.This is a cheap hotel that provides a good room in a superb location.

<Content>Horrible This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I didn't expect a lot from reading the reviews, but it was truly awful. My main issue was that the door to our room had warped and did not fit in the frame properly, we could actually see into the corridor from our room. My husband and I even considered sleeping in shifts!The wardrobes and chest of draws in the hotel room were falling to pieces, the shared bathrooms were not especially clean either.I really would not recommend this hotel

<Content>Loved Pension Dali - will stay again Stayed here 3 nights. So handy to everything - train, tourist bus, the market, galleries, food. 24/7 free internet in the foyer. We asked for a quiet room, and got a room that overlooked the back area with trees!, a rare thing in the middle of any city. Our room was clean and adequate, we used the shared bathrooms, all clean with plenty of loo paper. Staff at the desk always great and helpful, v. good English. For the budget traveller couldn't fault it.

<Content>Certainly a bit surreal I'm not too picky, and am usually comfortable in 2-stars, but oh la la! Aside from the vague sinking feeling we got upon opening the door to our home for the next 3 days, there were a few very specific problems: 1. The door to our room would lock, but was warped in such a way that the bottom of the door would not contact the wall, so there was almost an inch-wide slit of hallway light coming in our room. 2. The mattress was squeeky-springed and uncomfortable.3. The florescent lighting couldn't be harsher, and it flashed on over several long seconds of flickering.4. The toilets in the shared bathroom were rarely flushed, a plumbing problem because one had to consciously pull the cord and hold for a good long time in order to flush properly, but it shouldn't be the guest's problem to figure this out. At the very least there should be a sign. 5. When I was packing up my stuff, I took out my towel from the drawer and screamed when a huge cockroach came out with it. Hello Gregor Samsa!On the upside it was in a good location and the staff were friendly enough. Yes, it was one of the more reasonably priced places, but someone is making a mint luring tourists to this dive.

<Content>NEVER, EVER, EVER The Pension Dali has become my measurement of whether it makes as much sense to walk around all night opposed to getting a room. I didn't expect a lot, and I got even less. Except for the fact that there was an event going on and I could not find another room, I stayed here for two days before deciding I'd rather chance a train ride to another town and commute.I arrived about 9 p.m. and after checking in, took the lift to the floor the room was on. When I opened the door, I was a bit astounded at the size of the room. The room truly was about the size of a cell with a small twin mattress, a sink, and an armoire that I stuffed my belongings into. A TV was bolted to the ceiling. Okay, fair enough, I was only going to lay my head to rest here so I sucked it up.Although the room was stuffy, it was fortunate that it was not too hot - because opening a window resulted in the stench from the garbage in the central court wafting upward. The next morning, I immediately left for breakfast and to look around the area in the hopes of finding something else which I could not. I came back to the room about 10 p.m. and figured I was just going to have to tough it out.The next morning, I got my stuff ready to take a shower and walked across the hall to the bathroom. I was glad I had the foresight to bring my flip-flops so I would not need to step on the floor or bottom of the tub. But, the final straw came when as I looked up to rinse shampoo out of my hair, I saw that the tile in the bathroom ceiling had been moved away. I tried to strategically position myself closer to the shower curtain, finish my shower, get dressed, packed my [--] and checked out immediately.I got on the train/subway - and went to Sitges. I found a hostal there that was very nice with a pleasant owner, and commuted to Barcelona (about a 20-25 minute trip).Never, ever, ever - will I stay at anything like the Pension Dali again.

<Content>great location, good price, shabby bathroom The Pension is like a dorm/hostel with private rooms. It could be a noisy place depending on who is there. The front desk staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was basic but adequate, there is no a/c but a nice ceiling fan. There was also a small balcony overlooking the street. The shared bathroom was shabby but for the price and location a good deal for barcelona. Location can't be beat, 30 second walk to las ramblas and 2 minutes to the subway.

<Content>Won't stay here again! We booked for 3 nights on the Internet (based on the quite pretty pictures)- but just stayed one! We expected no luxury, just a simple and clean room, but were really disappointed. The first room we were given was really terrible. We went out after 2 Minutes and asked for another one. We could look for two other ones and decided to stay in a triple room we got without paying surcharge. It looked shabby and I desinfected the toilet. The walls were dirty. The bed was really bad and the mattress the worst we ever slept on. We checked out in the morning (what didn't surprised the staff) and went to another hotel (Hotel Comercio), that cost only 20 鈧?more, including a small breakfast (not really good, but ok ok to avoid starvation) and was really clean and much more nice. We looked at the rooms the evening before, because we were frightened. The only positive thing to say about Pension Dali was, that we could give aour valuables (wallets) to the reception, he locked them in a storage and we got them back suprisingly with everything in! The Pension and the employees gave no trustful impression at all!Don't stay here- spend a bit more to really enjoy your vacation!

<Content>great location We stayed here in March 2004 for a long weekend. The location was excellent, very central, La Ramblas almost on the doorstep! The room was basic, and not particularly clean, but overall a good place to stay if location and good value for money are important. We had a room at the front of the building, noisy at times, but it was good to have a balcony. The staff were mostly friendly. Good if you just want an inexpensive base to explore the city from.

<Content>great location, good place for the price The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. It's located in the heart of the old town, just a few meters from la Rambla, a metro stop, and Juicy Jones that is a very good vegan restaurant. The area is full of cafes where to have the morning coffee / breakfast that is not included in the price. The staff in the hotel were ok, and so was the room. There definitely was nothing luxurious nor anything extra, but what do you except for the price? Everything was clean, and the only real complain was the other bed that made really big noise for every movement. Other than this there was not any disturbing noise, not even during the night. I was very satisfied with my stay in this hotel, and probably i will stay here again if i ever travel back to Barcelona. And i hope that i will, it's a wonderful city.
