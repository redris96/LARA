<Content>Worst Checkin EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just came back from staying at this hotel and I have to say that I was shocked that there was a line up of about 30 people in front of me and it was taking well more than 5 minutes per person to be checked in and no wonder because there was only one person doing the checkin. After 30 minutes of virtually no advancement in the line up, I decided to go to the front and request to talk to the manager, I told her that this was non acceptable and that this has been the worst checkin experience of my whole life and I travel quite a lot through Europe, Asia, and North America. She was nice enough to say that they were doing all they could to expedite the process and that the reason that the line up was so long was that an unexpected flight was arriving, however I looked back on the line and there were well above 50 people waiting. Other customers were really pissed as well and started to complain. This is simply unacceptable, I was very pissed off. Also, when you arrive the bell boys do not great you at the door to help you out with the bags, only after you check in, this was a very bad thing in my opinion, particularly because the entrance has some steps and the ramp was not easy to access. Now that I think about it, the reason for this is that you typically tip the guy that helps out with the bags to your room and not the guy that helps you to get to checkin counter, my guess is that the bell boys have learnt this and do not even bother anymore at the entrance. Again, this is a very bad thing to happen in a Camino Real. The room were ok and view as well, but for a Camino Real below its typical standard. I had another problem at check out, but this one is a long story and even remembering makes me un easy. Overall, this is an OK Hotel, but the little things that make a great hotel are simply missing in this one.

<Content>Poor Quality Hotel Since we had an early departure from Mexico City we decided to stay the night at the Camino Real. I contacted the hotel directly and they quoted $330.00 USD + for the night. Subsequently went online and booked through Expedia at $150.00 including taxes ! Check-in was fine although no staff available to help with baggage. The room was located down a dingy corridor with dirty carpeting. Everything in the room was fine. Comfortable and clean beds, nice marble bathroom and large desk and chair. Air conditioning did not work well and the room became very hot and stuffy in the middle of the night. Had some snacks and sandwiches in the lobby bar which were horrible. Paid $13.00 US for a club sandwich and $7.00 US for a beer. Really overpriced with rude and indifferent service. As we were eating the hotel maintenance were setting up a handicraft market in the lobby and jumping up and down on a wooden stage they had built. Management were just looking on until I complained at which time they stopped. The Camino Real is really a very average airport hotel. Nothing special and not worth staying at unless you get a good rate.

<Content>Disappointed I was in Mexico City and wanted something close to the airport. There are many choices but I have stayed at other Camino locations within Mexico and very much liked them so I decided to give this one a shot. Besides being able to walk there from the airport, I was not impressed. The rooms are more expensive than other airport locations (offering free transportation), they charge you for internet access, and the food was a disappointment. The staff was very slow and really didn't seem to care about the customer which was a surprise. All of the other Camino locations have bent over backwords to take care of the customer. This location acted like it was a chore. Next time I'm in Mexico City I'll book the Fiesta Inn.

<Content>Bad news on arrival The fast connection from airport does not apply to international arrivals to terminal 2. You need to take a 15 min shuttle bus or airport train.Never book the room on arrival. I had to pay at least two times the going rate and when I left the following morning I did not notice that they had charged me for breakfast. Note that the dining room opens at 5am so there is no way I could have had breakfast. Dinner in coffe shop is booring and totally non mexican

<Content>convenient If you need an airport hotel to stay in after arriving or before departing from the Mexico City airport, I can't recommend this place enough. The entrance is right in the airport terminal but the minute you're in the lobby you've left all the hussle and bustle behind. Porters can carry your bags all the way from the luggage carrousel or from your room to your check in counter. The hotel isn't charming but clean and comfortable. Bathrooms are a bit basic, but what more do you need? There's a good breakfast buffet. For other meals, the choices are a coffee shop with standard Mexican food or a more expensive steak house. I'd never consider this place as a base to visit Mexico City, but we have frequently used it because flights from Europe often arrive too late to transfer to internal Mexican destinations, and it's been a major relief to chill out in a comfortable room minutes after picking up your bags, and then the next morning to walk from your room to your check in.

<Content>Walking distance from airport Booked this hotel as somewhere to crash out after a long flight from Europe. I also stayed here the night before I left Mexico City to fly back to the UK.The hotel is perfectly adequate. It is linked to the airport by an elevated walkway adjacent to the domestic terminal. It is only a few minutes walk from the international arrivals.Good sized bedrooms and very clean bathrooms. Quite quiet despite being so close to the runway. I did ask to be moved from the first room allocated to me as it overlooked a mass of aircon fans  was rather noisy.The first night's room 'overlooked' a wall at the back of the hotel. The second night's room had a view over the airport.Good breakfast buffet. The evening meal in one of the hotel restaurants was perfectly acceptable.I was able to arrange at late check-out at 18:00 with no problems.If you want to go down-town using the underground, the station is approx. five minutes walk away. All-in-all a perfectly acceptable choice if you want to crash out somewhere close to the airport after a long flight. A bit pricey, but then you are paying for the convenient loctaion

<Content>fine for over night stop Arriving at 1am local time and an 18 hour trip encouraged us to book an over night stop in Mexico city airport. it was well worth it, the bed was very comfortable, we coulnt hear any noise from the airport and the tap water was drinkable! inspite of jet lag the comfort and tranquility of the room enabled us to get some sleep and then worry about battling through to the centre of mexico city after a nights sleep. am so glad we did as the hotel was worth the stay!

<Content>Great location, pricey but comfortable We booked this because our flight arrived very late at night, and it was the closest hotel to the airport.We had a good nights sleep, on a good bed with thick curtains that made it easy to sleep.The front desk were helpful, and the tap-water was drinkable! I was most surprised to be told, but suffered no ill-effects. The breakfast was good, the only drawback was the price.Would use again under the same circumstances, if we'd have arrived earlier we could have made it into the center for cheaper accommodation.

<Content>Convenient...but pricey The Camino Real is one of two hotels at the Mexico City airport with direct access to the terminal building (the other one is the Hilton). There is a covered/enclosed walkway linking the hotel lobby with the main terminal, thereby eliminating the need to catch a shuttle.Outside of this feature however, there isn't that much that distinguishes this hotel from others in the vicinity, especially considering the price difference. The rooms are average, albeit larger than the Hilton's, but with the same amenities. There is a well equipped, complimentary fitness center in the top floor, but the pool is a joke: 50 feet long and 3 feet deep.The internet access is via cable and it is not complimentary. It costs $21 for a 24-hour access period, $5 per hour. The room service prices are relatively higher than those of other hotels.I would reommend this hotel for those who appreciate the convenience, speed, and relative safety of walking to their flights. But I would caution the budget-conscious.

<Content>Convenient This hotel is very convenient for a night between flights, but did not strike us as extraordinary.We arrived very tired with our daughter but were not offered any help with the luggage. As a sideline, luggage trolleys have to be left in the luggage area of the airport, but there are porters to take you to the hotel. On the way back, we had to tip a hotel porter to take the luggage across the bridge to the airport, then another one to take us to check-in. Still, the location is very convenient.The hotel room was very clean and modern. I was just a bit puzzled to find an ironing board, television etc but no hair dryer. So to summarise, the hotel is very convenient and the rooms are clean and fine, but it's as impersonal as any big hotel and does not leave a lasting impression.

<Content>A Bit Dated The only benefit of this hotel was the location, just a pedestrian bridge away from the airport. A great thing when you are flying over 20 hours from India to get there. The room was ok, clean sheets, clean carpet, etc. but NO tea /coffee making facilities in the room. What's that about? There was a nice big tub in the bathroom, and some nice bath gel, but no stopper in the tub, so how do u fill it up? TV channels were ok, but the retracting doors of the TV cabinet did not retract enough, and i kept banging into them, scraping quite a bit of skin off my shoulders. Ouch! Laundry was good, but the claimed same day service is only accurate if you live 48 hour days.Room Service was efficient. I ordered a Burger at 2 am one night. It arrived in 15 minutes, fresh, hot, and juicy.Coffee Shop food was ok. Breakfast spread was adequate. The nearby Angus restaurant, however, was a must try. Excellent food, nice ambience, and some very beautiful waitresses to boot!

<Content>Fine Hotel -- just get some staff who understand hospitality This could be a fine hotel--it's modern, the rooms are nice and well maintained, the Bistro restaurant we ate at was satisfactory. However, the staff seem to have their minds fixed solely on getting tips...while providing terrible service. We were ignored, then hassled, then lied to by the doormen and pestered by the waiters. The worst thing was when we pulled up in our rental car, we wanted to unload the luggage, check in, and then return the car to Hertz. The lead bellman tried to get us to hire his friend to return the car, at first saying it was a very difficult route to the car return, then saying he was unable to give us directions when we said we preferred to return it ourselves. First he said we couldn't leave our car in front of the hotel while we checked in (a matter of 10 minutes), then suggested we could if we tipped him appropriately for his trouble in watching our car as it sat in the driveway of the hotel. We did return the car ourselves, but no thanks to help from the hotel. A different bellboy in the lobby apparently got even with us for declining his help with our luggage (which was all on wheels) by misdirecting us to the elevators.But at least it's right at the airport, so we could skip the expensive hotel breakfast and have a fairly good inexpensive meal at the terminal a very short walk away. Our room was pleasant, quiet, and comfortable. Fortunately we had arranged a wake-up call, as there was a momentary power outage during the night that reset the electric alarm clock.

<Content>great place to stay I don't see what's all the fuss about the priciness of this hotel. You're staying literally a two minute walk from the international terminal, which makes it very worthwhile when one is taking an early morning flight out of Mexico City. The price you pay extra for is for the ultimate convenience, and for us on our trip, it was well worth it rather than having to deal with early morning traffic. The room was as nice as any I've stayed at near any airport, quiet, clean, bed VERY comfortable, English speaking TV as well. The workout center/gym is well-stocked with not only treadmills but elliptical trainers.We ate at the Mexican restaurant in the hotel. Both of our meals were outstanding. We had a half-bottle of wine, great entrees, dessert, and an after dinner drink. The bill came to around 100 dollars, tip included. Let's face it - in the U.S. you're going to pay at least that for a good meal at a nice restaurant in a nice hotel near any airport. My recommendation is that you can't go wrong staying here.

<Content>One of the best hotels Camino Real Airport Hotel at Mexico City is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It is clean, modern, safe, beautiful, convenient (you can walk to the airport), and very chic. Still the prices are reasonable. There is late check in and check out. My only problem was with the breakfast. We were told that breakfast was included in the price and we could eat until noon. When we went to the hotel restaurant at 11:30 am, we were seated and brought menus. When my girlfriend asked why we needed the menus when the buffet would be included, the manager said we had to go to the restaurant at the top floor and not the one we were at (they could have said that when we entered the restaurant telling them we were there for our free breakfast--instead they tried to see if they could trick us into paying--but then again in Mexico in general everyone tries to see how much money they can get out of you). When we went to the restaurant at the top floor, they said breakfast was over at 11 am. This kind of miscommunication (having been told breakfast is available till noon when it is only available till 11 am) was unacceptable for a hotel such as Camino Real. Other than that glitch, we were happy. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>If you must, it's convenient RECOMMENDED. Hotel is directly connected to airport. I used this for 1 night as had very early morning departure. Booked via Expedia, no problems. Hotel appears to have renovations under way. My room in the 2nd wing, was very small, 2 beds, relatively dimly illuminated. Bedding was just OK. Some street noise. Bathroom small as well, but well illuminated and in good order. If you come in late, or leave early - this facility is likely to be fine. It's the only 1 directly connected via a covered walkway, so convenience rules.

<Content>All you need in a airport hotel This was the perfect place to stay if you're flying out early in the morning. The rooms are very clean and comfortable with all the mod cons, and best of all the airport is only a 30 second walk across a footbridge. The rooms are also very well insulated, so you don't really hear the airport noise. The only disappointment was the night we stayed the room service wasn't available due to a problem with the gas in the kitchen. There are plenty of fast food outlets and a couple of restaurants at the airport though, it was just unfortunate that we wanted room service that night in particular. There was a bit of a queue at check-out at 5am when we had to get our flight, so take that into account, that everyone is likely to be rushing for flights when you leave and give yourselves and extra 15 mins or so.

<Content>Good Airport Hotel The Camino Real group has done a good job remodeling this hotel. Its location can not be beat. You can walk across a bridge to the airport, and given Mexico City's unpredictable traffic, that can be a great comfort. Lobby bar and restaurants are above average for your typical airport hotel. Best value of the airport hotels in Mexico City.

<Content>Good Location We stayed at the Camino Real on the last day of our trip to Mexico City. The hotel is very convenient if you have an early morning flight. You can walk from the hotel across a bridge to the terminal. The hotel staff was very pleasant. The rooms were ok, nothing great. Do not expect luxury by any means. The hotel was very clean. We paid $214 after taxes for our room with 2 beds. It was expensive, but very convenient. We did think about staying at the Hilton located inside the international terminal but after hearing all the reviews about how bad the smell is there, we decided on the Camino. We were happy with our stay. Had our flight not been so early in the morning, we would have stayed at the Four Seasons.

<Content>Pleasant Stay I missed my flight so I had to stay in a hotel. Even though I am familiar with Mexico City I felt overwhelmed in finding a safe hotel. The desk clerk at the airline I was traveling was nice enough to suggest Camino Real and made the reservation for me. At the entrance my bags were checked in and taken over by the bellman. After that my pleasant experience started. I had room service for dinner and breakfast which was delicious. All the employees were very courteous and efficient. My checkout was done in a very timely matter. My bags were taken all the way to the exit were the bellman hailed a baggage boy to take them all the way to the airline which I was going to fly out on the other side of airport. Overall it was a pleasant stay and I would recommend to anyone. The view of the room was awesome. My window faced the domestic landing runway of the airport. Even with this it was quiet and I slept peacefully. The room was extremely clean.

<Content>Nice 3 star hotel - Can walk to the gate st the airport. While it's not a lavish hotel, my room was clean, the staff very curtious, and the restaurants above standard. Unless you want to shop at the airport there isn't much to do as they definitely are catering to the business traveller. I didn't use the Business Center myself but did walk through  it seemed to have everything necessary. This hotel is best for overnight stays when catching an early flight or as a central point if you want to explore Mexico City on your own.

<Content>Decent, but not spectacular My husband and I were fortunate enough to take a 10 day trip to Mexico at the beginning of November. We stayed with a friend in Cuernavaca for 7 nights and at the Camino Real Aeropuerto in Mexico City for the last two nights.The hotel's location was convenient and the price was good... but the room was small and the bathroom could have been cleaned better. There were a couple of bolts sticking up out of the carpet on the bedroom floor that we both stubbed our toe or jammed our heel on in the middle of the night. It is located right next to the airport, but they did a fine job of sound insulation because we didn't hear a single plane the entire time. We did however hear the water squeeling throught the pipes at 6 a.m. when our neighbor took their shower both mornings.The waitstaff in the lounge area near the bar downstairs were just shy of rude. I have no doubt that part of this is because their 15% gratuity is automatically added to all tickets... but that's still no excuse. We arrived exhausted and hungry from Cuernavaca and this was the only place still open where we could grab a quick bite of food... it took forever and we practically had to chase down our waitress to get anything.Fortunately the rest of the staff was extremely helpful and tried their best to overcome the language gap (my husband and I piecing together the Spanish we've learned and them piecing together the English they know). All in all our stay was decent, but not spectacular. I expected more from a 4 star hotel, but at $102 a night I guess it was a good deal.

<Content>Check-in is Abominable Arrived at 7pm. Waited on line for 15 minutes while about 10 people in front of me for check-in. Decided to have dinner in the hotel restaurant with colleagues. When I came back after dinner the line was over 60 long. Took over 1 hour to get through the line for a simple process. (When I got to the front of the line, I counted 65 people behind me.)Hotel needs to install several more check-in CRTs, say 5-10, and man them for when the 4 or more European 747s that arrive all at the same time!! This is a simple disregard of customers based on their captive market.The restaurants were adequate, but nothing special. I've eaten more inspired Mexican food at locat taco stands than the fancy plates served at dinner. Again, captive customer can't find a cheaper better meal. You are captured.I did get a wake-up call, perfectly on schedule - from a friendly human being. There are machines that do that today. So, please take that girl and put her on the front desk for 7pm check in!! Automate the wake-up call.My room was an adequate airport hotel room, two twin beds. Three mini-pillows were absurd.I've travelled the world. This was the worst check-in experience ever.

<Content>Decent for a convenience stay Stayed here after getting in one night late and having an early AM connection the next day. The lobby is very nice and very pretty, and thankfully they have 24-hour room service, and friendly and English-speaking staff. While standing in the lobby, it looks like a very fine hotel. The rooms are clean but small and rundown. Fixtures are fine but old. The walls are literally paper-thin, and I could hear things going on in the hall and in other rooms. Ordered some pizza from room service and wished I hadn't. However, you can't beat the convenience factor and location. The hotel is literally right across from the domestic ticket counters, and then a short 2 minute walk across a footbridge to the main lobby. If placed in the same situation, with a late arrival and early departure, I'd stay here again.

<Content>OK at weekend rates, otherwise aripoff At $110 per night + taxes for weekend rates this is OK -and convenient for 7am flight. Rooms are well insulated, beds are OK. But $185 week rate - I would have been up in arms.The bathroom and general decor are the main issues - miniature bath room with sink positioned outside in the main room - like a cheap bed and breakfast. General decor is just cheap looking. Health club is a joke - music blasting out with a farce of a pool - not even properly filled and a step right around so messing up and ability to do laps. Service used was fine, but generally hotel really needs a revamp and would only use for weekends preferably with early flight.
