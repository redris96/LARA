<Content>What a New Year What a fantastic location for a New Year break in Berlin. And what a superb hotel with some of the best staff we have encountered. We booked a 3 night stay with 2 friends through Ryanair and took advantage of a very cheap flight and hotel deal. We wanted to be near the main festivities for new years Eve and we had a 20 to 30 minute walk towards the Brandenburg Gate area where there was a huge party taking place. We took the train from the airport at Schonefeld directly to Tiergarten and the hotel is just across the road from the station. The trains are cheap to use and we had access to most areas within the city in a matter of minutes. The hotel rooms are large and exceptionally comfortable, the staff excellent and we would not hesitate to return here if visiting Berlin.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location Hotel is just a step away from S-Bahn station Tiergarten and is located on the main street, but has double glazed windows so no noise. Lobby is very modern and clean, reception staff polite and efficient. Had a superior room on 5th floor (the building has some 15 floors, however hotels goes up to the 6th floor). Rooms were big, modern, nicely furnishered. Had all amenities (safe, mini bar, wireless...). The only minus was the bed. It was quite uncomfortable and didn't have a great sleep.Didn't bother with breakfast as our rate did not include it and it was priced at 鈧?7 per person. Instead we walked to the bakery on the S-bahn stop and had lovely breakfast for 鈧? for both. Bar looks lovely, can't comment on the prices as we rather had a drink in the centre. Hotel is some 20-25 minutes to the Brandeburg gate walking through the park.I would reccomend this hotel however beware of beds which could be better.

<Content>Great stay at the Novotel I was attending a conference hosted at the Novotel in early June. I booked a room directly with the hotel, and found that the conference rate wasn't available any longer, but they were able to offer me a much cheaper rate -- which of course, I grinned and bore.The hotel is modern, well maintained, clean and tidy, and comfortable. My room was spacious, with a large bathroom, big comfortable bed, and lots of work space. I had to work late one evening, and it was easy to find lots of desk space for papers, laptop, etc. Wireless was expensive, but do ask at the front desk for a business rate, as they will sell you five days of wireless access for a much more reasonable rate!Breakfast was excellent, with lots of choice, good coffee, and friendly service. I ate in the restaurant one evening, and had a few drinks in the bar while the football was on, and the service was excellent.The hotel's location is quite convenient, near to the Tiergarten and Zoo, about a 10-15 minutes walk to the Zoo Bahnhof. Admittedly I didn't need to get around much, but there's a subway stop next to the hotel. Overall, I was very happy with my stay - definitely one of the most comfortable hotels I've stayed at recently, and a very good location to hold a large ( 150 people) conference.

<Content>Convenient location with kid-friendly facilities. Great location across the street from a train stop.Modern decor and clean. One of the more kid-friendlyhotels that we've stayed at, featuring a play area withtoys and electronic games. Free Internet access atthis area. However, at least when we stayed, the hoteldidn't seem to have many guests, leading to an eerie, quiet atmosphere. The rooms were slightly awkwardly arranged.

<Content>Great hotel! I have just checked out of this hotel, and must say that I had a great time here.Great location, parallel to the Brandenburg Gate at the other end of Tiergarten. There is a bahn (train) station directly in front of the hotel, making it only a few minutes away from the centre of town.The hotel room was peaceful and relaxing, great selection in the mini bar, lots of space and lovely shower. There is a sauna on the 6th floor, along with lots of relaxation treatments, massages, a gym and sun deck balcony.The staff were extremely friendly on every occasion, the breakfast which I got included with my deal at Opodo.co.uk was great. 6am - 10.30am.If youre feeling a little peckish for a burger, there is also a Burger King over the road.On checking out, there is a room where your luggage will be stored, with tickets so you can do something during the day before your flight.I would definitley recommend this hotel, good cost, good location and enjoyable stay.

<Content>Great Location for a base in Berlin Booked the hotel directly via the Novatel's website for a Friday, Saturday and Sunday in Berlin.Location makes this easy for the driver to find and parking was easy and reasonably priced.Rooms were modern and clean, all the usual facilities are there.Did not dine at the hotel so I am unable to recommend this aspect, but we did have a few drinks at the bar before heading out at nights. Seemed to be a very popular business persons hotelTrain station is within 100 metres and this makes the hotel very easy for travel to any part of Berlin.Caught taxi's at night and they all knew of the hotels location so we didnt feel if we were being ripped offQuite a large flea market occurs on the weekend right in front of the hotel that makes for interetesing browsing.Overall the hotel was high quality, the rooms large enough and very comfortable, the location is excellent and the price we booked for on the net was excellent.Would stay there again

<Content>Children Controlling the Business Centre Computers Great location and fantastic breakfast (man媒 reviews said to skip this but we found the hotel to have a comprehensive offering). Two problems: computer access and TV channel choices. There is no CNN or BBC offering so that there is really no way you can be in touch with the news if you don't speak German. While the hotel is kind enough to offer 2 computers in their business centre, this centre is in the lobby next to the kiddie area. The polic媒 of the hotel is for persons over the age of 16 to use the computer, but every time one goes down to the computer area there are children under this age on the two computers. Finally you may get a computer, but don't be surprised if some kids show up and start harrasing you to get off the computer. It is an outrageous situation that I have not experienced anywhere in the world. The hotel should give a password out to guests that check-in or at least program a time-out to avoid this frustrating situation.

<Content>New, clean and a great nights sleep I was booked into this hotel by my company and so was therefore not expecting much as they usually go for the cheapest place. However, even though this was cheap it was very cheerful. I thought that being new nade it all the better but I got an excellent nights sleep, found the facilities fine and like others, can agree with more detailed reviews ahead of mine. Beware of the location though, the S Ban is very helpful but there is a 8 lane main road outisde the hotel. You can't hear it through the windows but I can imagine in the summer it might be annoying if you like to sleep with windows open. A great place though.

<Content>agree with other writers 'it is really a good hotel' I stayed at Novotel for a late October city- break with my husband.. The hotel has an excellent location and I can just agree with all previous writers who have given good reviews for this hotel. Clean and comfortable rooms and good service. The health club is excellent with several saunas and the training equipment is very modern. If you enjoy walking you can actually walk to many of the major sights. Otherwise- the S-ban train station is just opposite the hotel. There are not many restaurants real close to the hotel so then you have to walk a little.If you are staying at the hotel over the weekend you might enjoy the outdoor market that take place on the street just in front of the hotel on Sundays. You find everything from old uniforms to DVD:s.Enjoy your stay!

<Content>Decent hotel, convenient location I stayed here for a week during a business/tourist trip. The room looked exactly like other Novotels I have stayed in. All of the furnishings were very new and modern. The location was great, since the Tiergarten S-bahn station is right across the street. If you get a tourist pass, you can get to all of the major tourist sites in under ten minutes. The restaurant was excellent, if a bit spendy. I had a couple of dinners there, and everything I tried was tasty. The only downside to the stay was the ridiculously expensive and slow internet (20 euros/24 hours), and there was some noise from the squeaky stairwell door down the hall.Overall, I would recommend this hotel. Very good value for the price.

<Content>Very good choice This is one of the best Novotel's I've stayed in. The location is good - quiet at night, but right next to the S Bahn station with easy links all over the city. There is a shop in the station where you can buy cold drinks and snacks which are cheaper than using the mini bar. There's also a good licensed restaurant/cafe open all day from breakfast, called the Giraffe, with a nice outside seating area. Its just under the railway arch past the back of the local burger king. There is also a flea market right outside the hotel on Saturday and Sunday - a bit junky but interesting to wander around. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are a very good size and offered separate shower and bath. A couple of things to note: We were a group of 6 people and the lifts will only let you travel to the floor that your room key is programmed to which can be a bit annoying. The aircon is a bit tame on a hot day and the bar prices are a little steep. However the bar area is lovely and there's outdoor seating too. All in all, a very good choice at a very reasonable price. You could do a lot worse. I probably wouldn't recommend for those wanting to be in the middle of the night life though.

<Content>Novotel is a good choice I attended a conference in Berlin and chose this hotel instead of those arranged by the conference. The rates were actually better than the conference discount, and I think the hotel was generally better, too. (I booked through the hotel website. Bring your confirmation page to prove your discount.) This is a very modern hotel with good sized rooms (a couch as well as a bed), an easy to use safe in room, as well as a small fridge (it's full, with beer, juice, soda, water, etc., but you can take theirs out and put yours in if you like). The windows open, and if you ask for the quiet side of the hotel, you get a nice park-like view as well as a nice breeze. The young staff was cordial and capable. All speak English as well as German. The breakfast buffet was really a banquet and the quality of the food is excellent. There are more than 50 items to choose from. Germans like breakfast and you can have several, since many go back for seconds (and skip lunch). It's worth doing once to see if you like it. There are cheap breakfasts nearby, too. I did room service twice and it was prompt and had very good food and wine both times. The hotel is next to the beautiful Tiergarten park (with a cafe in it) and is also right next to an S-Bahn (elevated rail) stop that has several lines running to it. If you like, you can even travel directly to Potsdam from this S-Bahn stop. Very convenient to the whole city and makes it very safe to come home even if its late and you are alone. (Great restaurants at Savigny-Platz are only two stops away.)There is also a city taxi stand outside the hotel and the airport is only about 25 minutes away. I enjoyed staying here and would choose it again for both quality and convenience.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel was simply great, even though they tried to charge me for a breakfast i didnt have. This was however solved pretty quickly after they checked the signatures and they didnt match...Beware of the breakfast costing you a smaller fortune at 鈧?7.Try the pastry shop under the Tiergarten S-bahn Station for breakfast or take the train to Zoologischer garten.The location is right besides (25meters) the Tiergarten S-bahn station. (One stop from Zoologischer garten, 2minute ride)Beware that the closest U-Bahn station is a good 400-500m away even though is seems closer on most maps.The hotel seems to have a pretty good isolation though, since i couldnt hear the frequent traintraffic until opening the window.There is really nothing bad to be said about this hotel. Working AC. Clean new/refurbished rooms. Excellent service. Very stylish and clean bathroom and WC. (They were separate, excellent!)And as i stated the isolation in the hotel is good, I was convinced for a few days that we were the only ones living on the whole floor even though my girlfriend claimed otherwise.Burger King is about 100meters away if You need a quick meal.And a few tips: You need the keycard to operate the elevator. You NEED to use your keycard to get it to stop at the right floor. If Your are staying at floors 1 or 2, it might make sense to use the stairs (also requires keycard) even though the hotel staff doesnt seem too happy about it as it seems to be there just for evacution purposes.

<Content>Excellent value Booked this hotel after reading the reviews here, and wasn't disappointed. Central location, conveniently close to the Tiergarten S-Bahn station, Low rate when you choose the non-refundable payment option. Airy and clean room, not much of a view, though. Was a bit concerned about the heavy motor and railway traffic directly outside the building, but the sound insulation worked a charm. Note that breakfast isn't included, and was a whooping 17 Euros at the hotel, so if you're travelling on a budget I'd recommend eating in your room or getting a sandwich in the S-Bahn across the street and spend the money on something more entertaining, like the zoo, which is close nearby. Just take a stroll throught the park.

<Content>Novotel hit the spot I stayed for three nights at the Novotel which is just on the Western edge of Berlin's famous Tiergarten.Overall I was very impressed by the facilities, the room was large and very clean, with an ensuite plus, unusually, a seperate WC, which could be really handy if there were more than one person sharing the room. The room also featured a mini bar and safe (my only gripe is that there was no wine in the mini bar, only beer, but I ate in the hotel restaurant, and the staff were happy for me to bring the remains of a bottle up to my room, so this was really not a big problem). On checkout I was advised that the first item out of the minibar is gratis - gotta love a freebie!I made use of the gym section of the fitness centre on level 6, which was bright and airy but doesn't have a huge range of gym equipment, however, for the three days I was there it did the trick. If you enjoy a run, you could use the Tiergarten on your doorstep.My only gripes would be that there was no iron in the room, however, there is a laundry room on level 3 which the staff will give you a key card for on request.Also, the pillows on the bed were really better described as cushions in pillow cases, and there were only two English channels on the TV, BBC News 24 and CNN. However, I didn't go to Berlin to watch TV and I did find a good radio station to listen to when I got tired of hearing the same story on BBC News 24 for the sixty third time.I made full use of the hotel restaurant, as after each day of sightseeing, I was too tired to go out again, and it was just easier as a lone traveller to eat in house. The food was great and the waitress very friendly and attentive, although it was by no means very busy during my stay. The hotel bar was a nice quiet spot to sit and enjoy a pre dinner drink and has a happy hour each night.The rate I got from the hotel website, 108 Euros per night, included an excellent buffet breakfast, and I thought the price was really great value, considering what you'd pay for a similar place in London or Paris.The hotel is located about 100 metres from Tiergarten S-Bahn station, which was fantastic for getting around the city. The Riechstag and Pottsdamer Platz are just the other side of the Tiergarten, about 40 mins walk.I would recommend the Novotel am Tiergarten to anyone.

<Content>A surprisingly good hotel Have to confess that when I booked this hotel I expecting it to be a bit faceless being part of a large chain. Also wasn't entirely sure if location was good for our purposes as others had said it was in the diplomatic area. So I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised when we got to Berlin and got off the train at Tiergarten (flew with Easyjet so train straight from airport to hotel) only to find that the hotel was right beside the train stop. So whole experience of arrival was remarkably stress free. Hotel itself is large and the foyer is spacious so gives an impressive first impression. Rooms large, clean and comfortable. So we were off to a good start. Our first night we found we had to walk a bit to find a place to eat, so we learned to just jump on the train and go to other parts of the city to find things. Trains so good that this is no problem at all to do - and in fact encourages you to explore the city more than you might if a lot on your doorstep. Breakfast varied and tasty. Staff friendly and efficient, with everyone speaking perfect English (again my embarrassing lack of German). I'd stay again if I went back to Berlin.

<Content>What a bargain! Honestly - you would be foolish not to stay here. This hotel is simply awesome value for money. I stayed here for christmas - 26 GBP a night!!!. And the hotel is really modern and kept wonderfully warm. Rooms were extremely spacious with superb modern decor.I don't know what people are talking about the location of this hotel. It is bang next to the station - Tiergarten. Berlin trains are excellent and in 3-4 min you'll be in Alexanderplatz or zoologischer garder or somewhere ..The only catch to the hotel is - avoid breakfast. It is far too dear and is not included in the cost of the room. We didn't have breakfast here but on our last day - sat down for a nice dinner. Well worth it! And yes - don't forget to walk to the Victory column and go right to the top.PS: There's a burger king (or mac d) right next to Tiergarten station. Spend your christmas in Berlin - you'll never forget it.

<Content>Superb Bargain hotel!! This is how all Novotel Novation hotels should be. I really could not fault this at all. Got a fantastic rate of GBP25.00 per night on [--] and this is brilliant value for money especially when one thinks of how overpriced UK hotels are compared to what you can get in Berlin.Hotel is situated on Strasse des 17 Juni right by Tiergarten S-Bahn station. Having stayed in a few Berlin Hotels, this is no problem to get around anywhere regardless of the other reviews you may have read on here about this being out of the way. The Hauptbahnof is 5 minutes away, Alexanderplatz is 10 mins away. Bahnhof Zoo is 2 mins away by S-Bahn. If this is out of the way, i dread to think what areas like Pankow, Wilmersdorf and Charlottenberg are for some people!!Hotel lobby and corridor areas are modern, although in typical Novotel standard they are modern without being too flashy. The rooms are of a nice standard about 27 Square metres, with TV, honesty minibar, Tea and coffee making facilities, shower and seperate bath. Seperate toilet too in the room.Plenty of storage space, In room safe and a quiet interior room, I really couldn't fault this at all.For a hotel amongst the same star rating as the Park Plaza WallStrasse, its not as nice , but its equally on a par with the Park Inn in Alexanderplatz or the Novotel Berlin Mitte or Suitehotel at Potsdammer Platz.Rack rate at this hotel is about 145EUR per night which is reasonable considering what you are getting. Try getting a similar standard in a UK hotel for the same price turning up on the day!Top tip is to skip the buffet breakfast at 17 Euro and go across to the Wiener Fierbacker across the road and have a continental breakfast for a 2-3 Euros.This is without doubt the best Novotel I have had the pleasure of staying in

<Content>Perfect location for exploring Berlin My boyfriend and I have just returned home after a few days in Berlin. It's our second visit to Berlin, so we already knew the city when we arrived this time. Last visit we stayed at a hotel on/by Alexanderplatz, but this time I found a hotel on the web situated about 1,2 km south of there. That meant it was a bit closer to Unter den Linden, the museum island and the rest of the sights in the eastern part of Berlin. The hotel is situated in Fischerinsel, close to the Nikolai viertel, which is a tourist sight in itself. It's mainly a business hotel, but it worked well for us too. Good size on the room, and it had a sofa and a small table, and a nice, clean bathroom with a combined bath-tub and shower. The bed was a bit on the hard side, but ok. The staff was friendly, and helpful. We would consider staying there again.

<Content>convenience and comfort! We stayed at this hotel for four days at half term and were very pleased with every aspect of our stay. The rooms were well designed, spacious and comfortable. Despite overlooking the main road and the station (more of that later), double glazing ensured there was no noise. A kettle, tea bags,coffee etc were provided and there was a small mini bar.The staff were all very friendly and helpful, giving advice on restaurants, tourist attractions, trains etc.Due to our delayed arrival, we ate in the hotel's restaurant the first night and enjoyed it very much. Food was tasty and beautifully presented. Very taken with the translation of pak choi as 'anti tank gun choi - a literal translation!There was a great choice for breakfast of hot and cold buffet, plus fruits,cereals, breads etc. Worth the money.From Schoenefeld airport, the S9 train goes directly from platform 13 to the Tiergarten station, just over the road from the hotel. A City tour ticket is worth buying - 19 Euros for three days unlimited travel and reductions on entry prices to some attractions. Trains from the Tiergarten station are every five minutes or so, giving you easy access to the whole city.Try the area round Sauvignyplatz for good little bars and restaurants (we ate at Jules Verne). Morning coffee in the Hotel Adlon by the Brandenburg Gate gives you an idea of where the rich and famous hang out.Would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Highly recommended My wife, myself and our 7-year-old daughter stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in mid-February 2007. The rooms are quite large and the fold-down bed which my daughter used was surprisingly comfortable.My daughter unfortunately was ill for the last 3 days and the hotel could not have been better or more helpful. The reception staff were terrific and the room cleaners were also very helpful and cooperative. We were leaving on an afternoon flight and the hotel told us we could keep the room without charge for as long as we needed it before leaving for the airport.We started in a 1st floor room but asked to be moved as the heating didn't work too well. We were moved to a room on the 5th floor. The only complaint I have about the hotel is that they have a fitness centre on the 6th floor, so avoid rooms on the 5th floor in the area of 531 as the sound of vigorously exercising teutons can be a bit of a pest. Otherwise all was well.Kettle, tea and coffee are provided. There is an S-Bahn station across the road which gets you into the centre of the city in 10 minutes for 2.10 euros. You can walk there in half an hour or 45 minutes through Tiergarten. The Zoo and Kurfurstendamm is a 10 minute walk from the hotel.

<Content>Excellent hotel and location It was not easy to find a hotel in Berlin over New Year but the Dorint Novotel did absolutely meet our expectations!We booked a comfortable (executive) room in which a basket of fruit was waiting for us as well as bathrobes and slippers (the room was spacious, windows could be opened, bathtub). This was great after a long journey! A well equipped fitness as well as sauna and steambath can be used. Breakfast is Euro 17 and good. Enough choice of food and drinks.The hotel is located just opposite Tiergarten S-Bahn, in two stops you are at HauptBahnhof. You can also walk to Brandenburger Tor (about 30min), which is a nice walk down the road.We can highly recommend this hotel!
