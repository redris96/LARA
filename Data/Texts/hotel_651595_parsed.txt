<Content>Good Value in a Great Location A good price and great location; a five minute walk from Fredrichstrasse Railway Station and just a tad more to the Reichstag and Brandenberg Gate. Ok small rooms, but fine for a few nights stopover, comfy beds with fluffy duvets and pillows, and yes the shower floods the room - just dont use it on full power! The breakfast buffet was more than adequate and provided a very acceptable start to the day - and a big coffee pot cheerful served by the young, enthusiastic staff!Don't go expecting too much and you will be satisfied with a quite acceptable standard for bed  breakfast in a great location at an affordable price!

<Content>okay for the price its a fairly inexpensive hotel and it is in a good location, but the staff are not overly friendly at the front desk and the breakfast is average as are the rooms. its more like a good motel. The set up of the rooms is not great. i was sharing with a friend and each time one of us had to change or shower we had to leave the room because there is no door on the bathroom, and the way it is set up makes it difficult to have any privacy. the shower is facing the window on the street and the curtains dont give you much privacy either. the windows are huge and when we opened one in our room (because of lack of a/c) it stuck out so we had to go around it to get to the bathroom.its okay if your not spending too much time in the hotel. the freidrichstrasse train station is down the road and the reichstag is about a 10-15 minute walk.. dont expect much from this place and you wont be disappointed

<Content>A central Berlin Hotel A nice tidy hotel in a great location. In hot months the lack of air conditioning is a pain. Breakfast was well presented and internet wifi was easily accessed.If you want to get around Berlin, learn how to use the S Bahn and you can be most places very easily from the near by station.Walking distance to the German Parliament buildings and some lovely cafes and restaurants.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in a great area of Berlin! I was in this hotel this winter (at the beginning of January) with my girlfriend ant it was a great experience.The hotel is very near to some of the most popular places of Berlin and with bus (the bus stop is more or less 50 mt far from the hotel) we were able to reach easily Brandenburg Tor and Reichstag.The hotel was very confortable even if the rooms were very small. However we found everything we needed to spend few nights in Berlin.Moreover rooms were very clean and the towels were changed everyday.People at the reception were very kind and they could easily help us.We found an interesting special offer on the hotel website and if so the hotel can be quite cheap.Because of rooms dimensions maybe this is not the right hotel to stay in Berlin for one month but for a week it's great.It is a good starting point to visit Berlin.

<Content>Great experience Stayed at the Best Western Berlin Mitte for 2 days in April. Had a great stay. Within walking distance of the train station and Brandenburg Gate. Clean modern room and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located in a great neighborhood, lots of places to eat and drink. No complaints.

<Content>Unsatisfied travellers Apart from the breakfast which you couldn't fault, the staff in the breakfast room were very friendly and the location of the hotel, in a good position, I couldn't really give a positive review. There was no airconditioning so had to have window open which made it noisy during the night. The staff at front desk were not very helpful and made you feel as if it was an effort to help, room was very small but clean. They advertise internet but this is only if you have your lap top, and as we were on holidays this was the last thing we were taking with us.

<Content>okay if you stay in a good room Mixed feelings about this hotel. We stayed for four nights and the first night we had a room which was very hot (on the sun side and no airco), very noisy (next to a construction site where worked went on for 24hours a day) and a unpleasant smell of the diesel cars used by the workers. All this together resulted in a very short night.The next day we asked for another room at the other side of the hotel which we got without any problems. This room was much better. It was cool (on the shadow side of the hotel), much less noise from the construction site and no nasty smells. The room was still very small but it was clean, the bed was very good and it had a separate shower and toilet.Location of the hotel is great, right in the centre of Berlin, with many restaurants and bars nearby as well as train/s-bahn etc.Breakfast was also okay and the staff was friendly in general with a few exceptions however.

<Content>Great location, reasonable hotel. I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on a business trip.Overall, I found this a perfectly reasonable hotel. My room was fine, with comfy twin beds and clean, fresh bedding. A small wardrobe came stocked with lots of coat-hangers, which makes a refreshing change to other places I have stayed! The room was perfectly big enough for a short trip, although I think it would feel a little small for a couple staying for more than a few nights.The bathroom was open onto the room (toilet did have a door though), which was fine for me as I was travelling on my own. But given that this was a twin room, I thought the hotel should give some warning about this as not everyone travelling and booking a twin room will want to shower in front of their travelling companion! However, the shower was large and clean, with great water pressure.For me, the best thing about this hotel was its location. Just a couple of minutes walk from Freidrichstrasse station for easy access to anywhere in Berlin, and within 20 minutes walk of the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate. In the evenings, Mitte is a great district to be in with loads of restaurants and bars. This hotel is just two blocks behind the river, with some lovely bars and restaurants with tables and chairs overlooking the river.I don't have any real complaints about this hotel. The only slightly disappointing things were that there was no kettle in the room for making tea and coffee, although there were facilities for doing this in the lobby. Also, while the hotel offers free wifi access, you need to take your own laptop with you. The hotel has no computers available for business guests to check email, so I had to go to the internet cafe at Friedrichstrasse station. Next time, I would take my laptop with me and take advantage of the free wifi!I didn't try the hotel breakfast as it wasn't included in my room rate and cost 8 EURO! Go round the corner the the Espresso Cafe and have a fantastic coffee and either a pastry or sandwich for around 4 EURO instead.This place does what it says on the tin. I would certainly stay here again, for business or for pleasure, because the location is fantastic. If you aren't expecting 5 star luxury or high romance then I don't think you will be disappointed.

<Content>Price and Location Hard to Beat I visited Berlin with a group for a weekend in February 08. We were looking for an inexpensive hotel in a central location but which was clean and modern. Sounds like a lot to ask but the Best Western Mitte delivered. Located just off Freidreichstrasse ( sp?) it is within walking distance of most tourist attractions and museums. It is also close to the nightlife hotspots and has a taxi rank around the corner if you need to travel further afield.The rooms and facilities are basic but very clean and bright and the staff could not be more helpful. We paid Eur 112 for a twin room ( 2 people sharing) which we thought excellent value for the central location and friendly service.

<Content>Value for money My husband and I have just returned from 4 nights at this hotel. We found it to be clean,the staff friendly and breakfast good. If you are looking for accomodation that is close to all the sights of Berlin then I would recommend this area. There are also lots of great restaurants within walking distance. The train station is 200 metres away.Yes the rooms are small,but they are well designed and compact,so it didn't bother us at all.

<Content>Good All Rounder Predominately a business Hotel, but absolutely perfect for individual travellers. Hotel is new, rooms are modern, light, small, clean and very quiet (quite neighbourhood). The Breakfast is substantial with cold and hot offerings. There is a great Thai Restaurant across the road and a really nice man who runs a Dairy around the cnr for all your basic extras! A couple of small quirks but don鈥檛 let this put you off A) Make sure your room door is shut as they need a little extra pull when closing behind you (we had friends in the next room and was the same) B) If you are sharing a room with another person make sure you know them well as the Bathrooms are 鈥楧esigner鈥?and when you step out of the shower its not a private as you may like it to be. Reception staff mostly helpful but if things are too hard or they don鈥檛 quite understand you, you get a straight 鈥楴o鈥? Located in the 鈥楨ast鈥?side of Berlin this is a true find. Perfect location for sightseeing, just 5mins walk to the nearest Train station 鈥楩riedrichstrasse鈥?and Airport bus is also 5mins walk away.If you want to zip around Berlin at least grab an all day train  bus pass (yes you can even use it for the Airport)

The location of the hotel is perfect for enjoying all of Berlins sights and attractions. There are plenty of restaurants and bars close to the hotel and you are only a 5 minute walk away from the S Bhan station (train).

<Content>Fashionable but small This is a very trendy designer-style hotel (beige-brown modernist furniture, walk-in shower and all that) on a budget (paid just under EUR 75). It's ideally located near Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse, from where there are connections all across the city (if you come from Tegel, take the Underground exit Oranienburger Strasse - it's closer). The Deutsche Theater is just around the corner. At the moment, there is still a construction site opposite, and the rooms are not 100% soundproof, although as the previous reviewer said, there are noisier places. One of the drawbacks is that the rooms are very small and that the toilets, while separate in contrast to the shower, are very basic. This whole bath area may have fashionable aspirations, bur is a bit reminiscent of en-suite student accommodation; perhaps an area they should have invested a bit more in.

<Content>Prety good Good location , near Freidrichstrasse station. Rooms a bit small, and when we were there there was no door between the bedroom and the wash-hand basion and shower. Which seeemed very odd. There was of course a shower door. Staff friendly and helpful. Along the river about a 2 minute walk away there are somne nice bars.There is an Irish bar Oscar Wilde about 7-10 minutes walk away, handy if you want to watch english/irish sport. I was there during rugby world cup so managed to see a game i wanted to. Hotel withiun walking distance of brandenberg gate, checkpoint charlie (30 mins).

<Content>A new well located city hotel Excellent location close to Freidrichstrasse rail station (best to cross the river by the footbridge under the railway). New hotel but lacks a/c so ask for a fan if needed. Rooms are not large but very adequate, and at current prices is excellent vfm. Good breakfast but there are a lot of coffee shops around if you don't want to pig out on the buffet.

<Content>Good Value, Good Location, Good Staff I stayed from Fri 10th to Wednesday 15th Aug 2007.The location of this hotle is perfect - it's about 200m from Fredrichdatrasse Station which is one of the major S Bahn and UBahn stations in Berlin. This measn that when you come from Schoenfeld Airport, the train stops about 200m before your hotel. Also if you want to get around Berlin it's very handy.One of the best places to eat in Berlin is Orangierstrasse which is about 10 min walk from the hotel.The pice of teh hotel was 鈧?7 per night plus breakfast at 鈧?euros.The room, was new, clean and the bathroom facilities very good.There is a new building being erected acrsoos the road from the hotel, but this is not a big deal. There is also a 150 room 2nd Wold War bunker beside the ghotel which is a protected structure, and someone has built a very nice penthouse on top of it.The staff in the hotel are all yound and very helpful - I wanted to know where to go one night and asked the reception guy - I said I had a map - he said, and I quote, 'But I have a better map AND I have a marker' and proceeded to mark the route on a map he gave me. Some of these very German trains of thought ar e very amusing!I found the walking tours well worth while to do - brochures at hotel - don't forget that your watch needs to be an hour ahead or you miss it!Breaksfast was fine but a little basic. Somethimes they had one fruit e.g. mandarins, sometimes two (peaches and pineapple), they also have sliced ham, but this seems to be eaten first in teh morning.So if I were going back to BErlin I would stay at this hotel again.PS: Very good Indian Restaurant at top of Orangierstrasse - large but very fast service and high quality.

<Content>Brilliant low priced hotel, Excellent staff and great location. A great choice! We have just returned from a 3 day trip to Berlin where we stayed at the Best Western Berlin Mitte. Having booked our accommodation quite cheaply on Last Minute, I was a bit wary as to what to expect when we arrived but I was pleasantly surprised. This hotel is in an excellent location, within a few minutes walk of one of the main train stations, Fredrichstrabe, and within easy walking distance of numerous sights and restaurants/bars. It is also easily accessible to numerous trams and buses, so location wise, it's perfect!!The hotel itself is brand new, only opened earlier this year, so the decor and design is modern, clean and tidy. The rooms are reasonable size, not huge but enough room to move around. The shower is one of the best that I have had in my life!The only comment I have is that the bathroom is not in an ensuite style room, it is a glassed cubicle area in the corner of the room. Therefore, if you are sharing with someone who is not your partner (i.e. family/2 friends), it is not possible to have a shower while the other person is in the room as they can see straight into your shower cubicle! This aside, the bathroom was clean, tidy, enough room to move etc. The toilet was in a seperate area (with it's own door) so no problems there. The reception staff were extremely helpful, giving us sight seeing tips and dining tips each day and local knowledge. There is a small bar at the hotel, but you are so close to many other bars and restaurants that we didn't use it. Breakfast is also available (8 euros/person) but again, due to the brilliant location, we chose to eat out. So apart from the bathroom, this hotel is excellent, modern, clean, roomy, fantastically located with friendly staff, and if you are able to book it online and get a discounted rate...you really can't go wrong!Have a great trip to Berlin! Any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
