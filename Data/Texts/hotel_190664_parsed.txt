<Content>Wonderful stay My husband and I stayed at the Regent at the end of November. We had the most fantastic stay - staff are welcoming, helpful beyond the call of duty and without exception make you feel very special. The room was spacious and very comfortably decorated. The bathroom had seperate shower and bath, endless supply of top end tolieteries and towels. Breakfast was like a four course feast - nothing too much trouble or effort. Never needed to wait for anything during the three days we spent there. The concierge booked restaurants for us on 2 out of the 3 nights of our stay and was spot on with his choices for us. He also supplied advice on a range of requests we had over the few days. The bar is very expensive 11 euros for a baileys! but very comfortable, again with exemplary service. Berlin itself is a fantastic city - we had not been before and enjoyed our stay immensely but the cherry on the cake was the fabulous Regent.

<Content>Berlin revisited Spent the past week in Berlin staying at the Regent Hotel. Stayed there five years ago when it was the Four Seasons. Same high level in every aspect. We were upgraded to a suite through our travel agent, Lorraine travel and they arranged for additional amenities. Room was wonderfully quiet although it looked out on the street. Location for us is perfect as we love the museums, operas and concerts and could walk to most everything. The hotel now has a Michelin two star restaurant where we ate and it was a rating well deserved. The meal and service were superb. Service throughout the hotel was excellent with special kudos to the concierge, Lars.We look forward staying there again on our next trip.

<Content>Better than we expected disclosure - our stay was May, 2007, and I've been remiss in not posting thisLast Spring we did a 22-day Totalitarian Tour (Vienna, Prague, Berlin), winding up in Berlin for 10 days (which wasn't enough for this New Yorker to see everything).We wanted the following (in no particular order):central locationquietlargish roomgood servicegood room serviceOn all counts the Regent reached or surpassed our expectations.We arrived after a long trip from Prague, and everything was done from the first moment to make our stay comfortable. Fruit and chocolate in the room, replenished every day. Room service food very good, and at the time requested. Maid service well done, and porter too. It was almost like being in a 2nd home.The room had a side view of the Gendarmenmarkt square, which was fine - except for the corner rooms, none have a direct view (the square is catty-corner to the hotel, not directly across). There was no late night or early morning street noise, except for one night - and that was only a slightly tipsy crowd singing its way down the street - not so annoying for someone whose home is in Greenwich VIllage.As many have mentioned, the location is perfect for seeing Mitte, with excellent restaurants nearby. By the way, if no one has mentioned Fassbender  Rausch Chocolatiers, let me be the first. If you are or have a chocolate lover along, go - it's 3 blocks away from the hotel (opposite the SW corner of Gendarmenmarkt square) and be prepared for a chocolate shop unlike any other.Also - my wife doesn't trust hotel laundry and/or dry cleaning services, but in this case she relented (we needed lots of it - don't do it in Prague) and was pleasantly surprised - as good as she remembered at The Regent in Sydney.When we go back to Berlin, it will be our home away again.

<Content>Great hotel in a great city I had a lovely weekend in Belin and the stay at the Regent was great. This was already my second time there. The location is perfect and this time I got a room at the 8th floor. Rooms are really big and confortable with complimentary Wireles Internet and DVD player. Just the TV is a little bit old - they could do better with Flatscreen.Bathroom is huge, very clean, towels and bathrobes very confortable.Breakfast is delicious, with a large selection of hot dishes and sweets that are brought to you so you do not have to stand up the whole time.Very friendly and efficient employees at the reception desk, concierge and porter. Also housekeeping was very friendly. Complimentary shoe cleaning worked great!Fitness and sauna are small but nice. Pity that they do not have a swimming pool.Just one issue during breakfast this time: I had the impression some waiters were new at the hotel and looked somehow nervous and stressed. But they were guided by other colleagues who really knew what they were doing.I am very often in Berlin, and the Regent will always be my first choice. Just a pity that the special rate I got is not always available.

<Content>First class hotel in Berlin This place was part of the Four Seasons chain before changing to Regent. I used to stay here often when I worked on a project with a JV partner in Berlin. It is is centrally located close to the Brandenburg Gate, the Holocaust Memorial, Checkpoint Charlie, the Bundestag (the Parliament), Gendarmenmarkt and the concert hall. This is one of the best hotels in the world I know, second only to the Mandarin Oriental in Kuala Lumpur. The service here is simply impeccable, from getting out of your car, checking in, getting settled in your room, to ordering drinks. The place is elegant, with an old-world charm, but relatively newly built. The hotel restaurant, while expensive, has some very good food and wine selection. The breakfast is excellent. Down the street a block or two is my favorite restaurant Lutter und Wegner (dine in a wine cellar appointed in dark wood, surrounded by wine bottles). The hotel concierges are very capable. I asked if they could find a rental car with a manual gearbox and at least 200 bhp, to avoid the usual offerings of automatics at most rental companies, and they did... Perfect equipment for a week on the Autobahn. :)

<Content>A lovely gem After a 30 hour flight I have to confess to a tiny bit of initital disappointment with the Regent. I had read that you should request a room with a view over the Gendarmenmarkt. I emailed and phoned the hotel to request such a room, but when i arrived I was told my room was not in the right price bracket to have such a view. It would have been helpful if someone had replied to my email to let me know this, rather than disappoint me at check in. The room I was given was pleasant - it had at least a partial view of the Gendarmenmarkt, but it was a bit tired - 1980s sage green carpet, pale apricot walls and gold taps in the bathroom. (One other quibble which I will put now so as not to end on a negative note - outrageously expensive computer access - I wish hotels would learn that the what they reap in profit on this, they must lose in annoyed guests.) Once I had a decent night sleep though I could begin to appreciate the Regent's other benefits and I forgave them for the decor. The Regent is in a fabulous location - on a quiet side street in the old Eastern bloc - perfectly located within walking distance of all the major sightseeing centres. I had worried that this part of town was a little removed from the heart of the city - the Kurfurstendam - but after visting that side of town I felt that we had definitely made the right location decision. The Regent is walking distance to the Brnadenburg Gate, to Checkpoint Charlie, to all the major galleries and museums. There is the Galleries Lafayette across the street and several beautiful high end boutiques minutes from the hotel. The service in the hotel was very impressive - complimentary shoe shine each night; a book mark left on a book we were reading; bowls of chocolates left every day and a box of chocolates left as a farewell gift. The doorman was particularly friendly and it was a pleasure to come back to the hotel at the end of each day. It is a relatively small hotel so the overall feel is one of calmness and tranquility.

<Content>Top End of 5 Star Deluxe This is a superb hotel. Faultless.We have stayed in many of the 'great' hotels in the world and we would put the Regent up there with the best.The service was impeccable with all the staff doing all that was possible to make our stay memorable - which it certainly was. The size, position and furbishment of our room was of the highest order and the location of the Hotel was ideal for our sightseeing and tourist purposes.A definite must for those seeking the highest quality at a competitive price.

<Content>Just another glowing recommendation Listen, you probably don't need to read my review to convince you that the Regent is an excellent hotel. It's perfectly situated in the East, about a two minute walk from the Gendamenmarkt. Charlotenstrasse, the street the hotel is on, is full of good restaurants and some decent shopping. We did a walking tour of East Berlin, and we ended just a few minutes from the Regent.As for the hotel itself, it can be summed up in one word: service. The service is absolutely superb; the staff is willing to do almost anything to make sure that your stay is satisfying. I forgot a blazer in the closet of my room, and I called the next day with the slim hope that they had recovered it. In fact, they did, along with a bottle of medicine I had also forgotten, and they offered without my even asking to ship them both home for me at no profit to them. What other hotel would have done this?The interior is warm and welcoming without being particularly spectacular, and the same went for our room. It was tastefully decorated and very homey, and I actually liked that it lacked the ostentation of other hotels in its class.Overall, this is, in my mind, THE place to stay in East Berlin.

<Content>High standards but lacking atmosphere Modern exterior and neo classic French decor inside. Very high standards of service, some of which go back to Four Seasons days, like Frette bed linen and L'Occitane toiletries.The rooms are large (I had one with a view to the Gendarmenmarkt), very comfortable and in mint condition.The restaurant is two-star Michelin, and there is also a good lounge + terrace with drinks and sweets (all good, with particular attention paid to the tea service). Breakfast combines a buffet with dishes cooked to order. The cooked dishes were superb but the buffet is too limited. One morning I had breakfast at the Adlon and the buffet there was far better (also more expensive).The fitness is good and very elegant, but there is no pool and the sauna facilities are limited for a hotel of this standard.During this trip I also stayed at the Ritz Carlton (see my review), and the main difference is that the staff at the Regent is much more formal.

<Content>Luxury Central Berlin: The Regent, Berlin, Luxury Central.Date: 10th Jan, 2008.Reviewer: Michael T, Notts.Just spent 2 nights in this fantastic hotel in central Berlin, almost booked into a larger hotel around the corner but pleased not to have done due to the scaffolding outside. The Regent genuinely is a luxury hotel, marble foyer, cosy bar and fantastic michelin star restaurant.The staff were attentive, spoke perfect English and as we were out of season and it was my wife's birthday we were upgraded to a mini suite for free. The prices are that of a luxury hotel, so expect to pay top prices: dinner for two with wine just over 拢200. Breakfast (was included) was fabulous. Stay here!

<Content>It's good but not Berlin's nicest It's very clean, comfortable and central but it's more very good chain standard than one of the alleged best hotels in the World (Conde Nast obviously saw different rooms). It is portentous rather than stylish: and the room decor was a depressing and naff derivative of the 1950s.The Regent's working staff at the hotel (doormen, room service, cleaners) seem to be meticulous but managerial staff were engrossed in conversation with colleagues, visibly irritated by my appearance and words did not become deeds. There are nicer if less pretentious hotels in Berlin: for example, the Sofitel Berlin Gendarmenmarkt next door has its quirks and lacks some of the pretension of the Regent but it is a nicer place to stay and the staff are kinder.

<Content>One of the best The Regent Hotel is a beautiful hotel located in center city Berlin. A very courtious and gratious staff throughout this hotel. The rooms are what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. It reminded me very much of The Ritz Carlton hotels in the United States. The food was excellent in their 5 star restaurant. I feel their rates are pretty much in line with other hotels of this caliber. Rooms are very spacious with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. All rooms are accented by a very large marble bathroom. Simply a beautiful property.

Breakfast was a little fussy and is done better at other similar hotels I've been to.We chose to eat out and therefore can't comment on the restaurant for dinner but it did look very expensive even for Berlin and slightly over the top.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel My wife and I stayed spent four nights at this wonderful property. The rooms and the common areas are of Four Seasons Hotel design and quality. I beleieve this was a former Four Saesons Hotel. The restaurant is superb and of course pricey but was our best meal in Berlin. The breakfast that came with our Amex platinum package was great and we were not charged for the coffee we had in our room before going to the restaurant later in the morning. I was torn between this hotel ant the Ritz and am glad I decided to stay here. We liked the area better than the Ritz or the Adlon.

<Content>Superb in Every Way Although not impressive looking on the outside, The Regent is superb in every way inside. The public areas are beautiful including a small courtyard area for drinks and conversation. Rooms are luxurious and large with every amenity provided for. For an extra quiet room ask for one facing the courtyard. But best of all is the knowledgeable and caring staff. Every staff member we encountered went out of their way to be nice and helpful. Special thanks to Cem the concierge who was unbelievably helpful in answering our many questions about getting around Berlin and it's various sights. The hotel in the former East Berlin is just off the Unter Den Linden the main shopping street. The hotel is within walking distance of the Reichstag, the Brandenburg Gate, the Berliner Dom, Staats Opera, the Oper Komisch, Gendarmenmarkt Square, the Konzerthaus,and Museum Island

<Content>luxurious and overlooked The Regent, Berlin, used to be the Four Seasons. Four Seasons obviously has a much more recognized name. We stayed in this hotel when it was the Four Seasons and loved it then. On this trip back to Berlin, we were a little concerned because of the name change, even though Four Seasons owns Regent, I believe. The name change seemed like a downgrade. In addition, with all the other deluxe hotels in Berlin, like the Adlon, where Michael Jackson stayed (and dangled his baby off the balcony), the Regent seemed almost second rate. We got a terrific rate-- unexpectedly reasonable, especially considering what other deluxe properties were asking.What a delight. The Regent is beautiful, elegant and has SUPERB service-- attentive and polite, no whiff of condescension, even when I asked one afternoon re dinner at their Michelin one star restaurantdressed in a Tshirt and jeans. Rather, the maitre'd, a day later when we were seated, told me, very endearingly, that she hadn't expectedto see me return.This is a truly wonderful hotel, in a wonderful location only a blockfrom Unter den Linden, a few blocks from the Brandenburg Gate and Museum Island, with some of Berlin's best restaurants within a few blocks. Try Vau, with 2 Michelin stars, only across the beautiful Gendamenmarkt Square. They have outdoor seating in the courtyard and are very reasonable for lunch. The outdoor restaurants in the square are also reasonably good and less touristy than you might expect.I have stayed in numerous other hotels in Berlin -- the Ritz-Carlton,the Grand Hyatt, the Bristol Kempinski. This is the best of the ones I've stayed in.

<Content>Excellent Hotel  I just completed a week鈥檚 stay at the Regent Berlin and was generally pleased with my stay. The hotel is located in East Berlin in the up and coming Friedrichstrasse area one block from the major street Unter den Linden Blvd. Friedrichstrasse is emerging as a major upscale shopping area in Berlin although it鈥檚 not yet on a par with Kurf眉rstendamm Strasse in West Berlin. The Regent鈥檚 location is very convenient for Museum Island and many of the other major attractions of the city and is close to the other 5 star hotels. As for the hotel service is excellent and the staff is very attentive and cooperative. This hotel was a Four Seasons before the owners and the chain decided to part ways and thus the change of flags to Regent. The rooms are typical of other Four Seasons hotels, although not as nice as say the George V in Paris. On the negative side I found that the HVAC system was strange in that it was apparently a central system and room controls were limited. The televisions also need to be updated to flat screens and the choice of English language channels improved. On a very positive note this hotel provided high speed Internet access free of charge whereas Four Seasons flagged hotels can charge as much as $35 鈥?40 per day. Overall I highly recommend the Regent Berlin but they need some fine tuning.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Great Staff Stayed here in December and had a wonderful time from start to finish. Very helpful staff, spacious room with view over Gendenmarkt, whole experience was superb. Booked the hotel by phone, advised on the nicest room (and that would have virtually as good a view from a cheaper room), promised that the room would be available early morning as we were arriving from the sleeper from Brussels.Duly arrived at 8.45, assured the room was just being checked by the housekeeper, we were given coffee and our bags and coats whisked away. That was the start of a an extremely comfortable stay. The staff were charming and helpful, the room always immaculate. We didn't take breakfast as there are so many good bars and cafes close by that always are better value and actually more fun.I would return there any time - and it was topped off by taking the sleeper home again - trains don't care about fog!

<Content>Outstanding quality for price paid I am very picky for my hotels and after staying at the highly overrated Westin Berlin (I am a starwood platinum member who made the mistake to stay there last year) I found the Regent to be of excellent quality and the staff professional. They remembered my name for our one night stay whenever we approached the desk and took care promptly of each request. The room was large, the king size bed comfortable and the room very very quiet even though we faced the street. The food was good but not cheap for breakfast and service was perfect. I would highly recommend this property to anyone who is use to 4-5 star hotels in Europe. I have stayed at several and found this one to be one of the best. I look forward to staying there again when I return to Berlin and in spite of the fact I would benefit by staying at the Westin Berlin as a platinum member. That starwood property is out and out nasty and should be closed for a remodeling.

<Content>Among World's Best My teenage sons and I cannot say enough about this hotel. Chic, beautiful, delightfully located, with a welcoming, truly helpful staff. Our experience far surpassed that at our other 5-star hotels, leading us to believe that the Regent is still a secret waiting to be discovered. I, for one, would detest the sterile and ill-located high rises of Potsdamer Platz. Give me the historic Gendarmenmrkt and a short stroll to Unter den Linden and the Pergamon any day. P.S. I am a total princess, if that helps guide you.

<Content>Best place to stay in Berlin My family and I are experienced European travelers, but this was our first trip to Berlin. We generally stay in fairly nice hotels but none have ever been as wonderful as this hotel - regardless of price.The service provided by every member of the staff - from reception, concierge, bell service, restaurants, house-keeping, room service, etc. - exceeded that of any hotel I've ever stayed in. They were friendly, gregarious, and really seemed to care about making our stay a memorable one. We were shown to our rooms by one of the reception staff, greeted with a welcome gift in the room (a personalized large chocolate chip cookie, assorted candies and some fruit), and given thorough information and directions about the room amenities. Each day, upon return to our rooms, we found more goodies and fruit. Returning from site seeing on our last night stay in the hotel, we found a large plate of chocolates and a chocolate souffle' awaiting us on the side table. The room was spotlessly cleaned each day. Every time we saw any staff member that we had met before, they greeted us by name, and with a firendly smile. Obviously, I cannot say enough about the service.In addition to superb service, the hotel is very well located virtually at the center of the more significant historical sites and attractions, with many being within walking distance. For those sites that require subway travel, the hotel is one short block from a U-Bahn subway entrance.The food in the restaurants was fantastic - some of the best we had in all of Berlin, and comparable to some of the best meals I've had anywhere in Europe.All of this was at a price of about $200 Euros per night (not including any meals). It truly would have been worth it had we paid double that amount.

<Content>Fantastic, Fabulous Hotel The Regent is a #1 first class hotel. The staff goes out of their way to satisfy all of your wishes. The location one block from the Gendarmarket is great with lots of restaurants close by and fabulous shopping in the Friedrichstrasse. It is also a block from the Franzchoistrasse subway station (in the U line), and a block from the Under den Linden avenue (where the Branderburg Gate is located).The rooms are big in size. They are classy in their look, or as they say timeless elegance. The bed is really plushy and the pillows are down feather and huge!. If you have allergies, they will bring hypo-allergenic pillows for you. You also have free internet access in your room.The bathroom is outstanding. The marble tiles are very pretty with separate bathtub and shower plus a separate toilet (with door). The products in the bathroom are L'Occitane and the towels are really nice. The closet is equiped with wooden and satin hangers (nice touch) and it has a safe. The breakfast is outstanding and included in the price of the room. You get what they call The Regent Breakfast. It has juice, coffee/tea, basket of rolls, 3-tier plate selection of cheeses, cold cuts and pates. Also fruit, cereals, and pastries. You can also add an egg dish, french toast, bagel/salmon and pancakes. And you can eat as much as you want! They also have a Japanese Breakfast (with miso soup) and a continental breakfast, plus you can order a la carte.Definitively, this is one fantastic place to stay.
