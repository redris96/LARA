<Content>Excellent start to our holiday! My husband and I transited for 2 nights in Singapore en route to New Zealand. We chose to stay at the Goodwood Park Hotel, initially because we wanted to be close to the Orchard Road shops. What we actually got was an oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city: a beautiful building, utterly professional and obliging members of staff and fantastic food. The hotel is immaculately clean, our room was very comfortable and very well equipped. The response to requests from House-keeping or Reception was immediate and at all times we experienced service with a smile. Our room was on the first floor and I must admit that there was a very slight odour of mould in the corridor, however, this was obviously known to the staff because a small machine was permanently installed to deal with the problem. We would recommend afternoon tea as an indugent experience!

<Content>Nice A nice hotel with great service but i would only class this as a 4 star hotel at the most. The positives are; the hotel is close to everything, such as shopping and transport, the place is clean and everything in the room works. The hotel has 2 great pools and a nice breakfast buffet ,along with very nice, helpful staff and a late checkout.The negatives are, the bed was very hard (new mattress needed?) the cost of eating or drinking here are over the top (but then again Singapore seems to be more expensive than it use to be) the room can be quite noisy when people are going pass in the hallway (like cleaners and other guests) so no sleeping in past 7.30am. This is my second trip to Singapore and 6th trip overseas and overall i would say a standard room here is well priced and the hotel is well located, but you might want to eat elsewhere to save on that spending money.

<Content>beautiful historic hotel my husband and i stayed at the goodwood park for 5 days and had a wonderful stay. great location for shopping and dining on orchard road but also easy MRT ride to anywhere (5 minute walk to MRT). room was large and nicely appointed. hotel itself is really beautiful and the staff is excellent. lovely pools, although we did not use them - too busy sightseeing. i would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Elegant, spacious, best oasis pool We had a wonderful stay at the Goodwood for 3 days in April 2008 after a Star Cruise through the Malacca Straits (which was fabulous). A three story refuge amongst the towering high rise hotels, the Goodwood is elegant with harmonising and peaceful decore, and serviced by efficient staff who are quiet and unobtrusive but readily available. The Oasis Pool was a delight and I spent a whole day there under the shade of the palm trees and had almost exclusive use of it as only two other couples came along for short swims. The room was spacious and immaculate, cleaned each morning and towels refreshed again in the afternoon if required. Breakfast was brilliant as was the service. The small museum of early chinese treasures retrieved from a sunken ship was very interesting and informative. After visiting crowded Orchard Rd once, and deciding that shopping and touring was not for us, we ensconced ourselves in this haven and enjoyed the relaxing surrounds.The only detraction was that we wanted to wash our week's worth of clothes from the cruise: obtain tokens fom reception, find the laundromat located under a separate building at the rear (a bit hard to find) , cost S$5 per load to wash and S$5 per load to dry, one of the dryers is not warm enough so it ended up costing S$30 to do our washing which I felt was rather expensive. But then we found Singapore expensive for just about everything except the taxis.

<Content>An oasis amid the hustle and bustle Having read some bad reviews of this hotel in the past, I can only conclude that they've revamped all the rooms now and it would be hard to have a bad experience.Our room was quiet, spacious and very comfortable, with a balcony overlooking the smaller second pool and its fringe of lush greenery. The decor was classy without being over-the-top. The beds, pillows and linen were top quality. Service was always friendly, attentive and helpful.The location is excellent as the shopping mall strip starts next door and an easy 15 mins walk away turns into the famous Orchard St. Despite being so close, you still get the feeling of quiet and calm; an oasis with none of the hordes traipsing by the front door. Room service is prompt. Buffet breakfast is excellent. Tiffin (afternoon tea) is known amongst the best. Their Coffee Lounge does wonderful dinners. Didn't try their other restaurants.The old building has soul and character, and the new wing blends pretty seamlessly into it.In booking here I had dismissed all those other generic hotels as being same-old, same-old. But wondered about other boutique hotels which may have offered something different, so I visited them. I wasn't disappointed with my choice of Goodwood Park Hotel. The roominess, the location, the vegetation, the serenity, the service, the handiness to everything outshone the rest.

<Content>Great hotel, great location I stayed in Goodwood Hotel 8th-10th April 2008. The hotel itself is spectacular, with a fairly colonial looking exterior facade, but has undergone dramatic renovation interiorly. Its modern restaurant and bar flank the older part. The staff were very helpful and pleasant.The room was beautiful and well maintained. Great air con too!Cannot comment on food, as we ate out during our stay. Excellent location.Well worth a stay.

<Content>Brilliant hotel Booked with some trepidation after reading some negative reviews of this hotel. However I am now convinced that some reviewers of hotels will never be pleased by anything and are deliberately negative and nit picking.This is a gorgeous colonial style hotel in a top location by Orchard Road. Its Raffles esqe but at a lower price. We booked through Wotif.com so got over 1/2 price for the room which turned out to be a beautiful 2 bathroom suite.2 beautiful pools and a fab buffet breakfast make this a highly recommended stopover base in Singapore.We stayed with our 3 year old son, he had a spare bed and is still talking about the hotel on our return.

<Content>Good Hotel in the Shopping Mecca of Singapore It was my second stay at this property.The location is good and even ideal for those willing to go shopping. The rooms are good, a bit spartan for a 5 star property, but really appropriate.The pool is OK, a bit dated, like other parts of the hotel, but still very nice.Internet access is good but expensive. $30 SGD per day is becoming excessive. If they don't charge to use the televsion why internet. If there is a charge made to the hotel, it should be absorbed in the room charge, or else passed on at cost. This of course applies to most hotels. Ultimately, there is no extra cost for a hotel to charge for wi fi use on an unsecured network because there is no extra cost for the hotel in providing the service. As an experienced traveller, this is getting out of hand, and a hidden cost not disclosed to the traveller.But the Goodwork Park is a good property, in an excellent location. If you are in Singapore on business, you should stay in another area though, such as Clarke Quay on the river. For shopping though, or a short stopover, Goodwork Park is highly recommended.

<Content>An experience to remember We stayed for two nights at the Goodwood at the start of our silver anniversary trip to Australia. From arrival to check out the whole experience was one of being looked after, even pampered. In keeping with rest of the hotel, the room was stylish and superbly comfortable with a balcony overlooking the blocks to the rear, though this did not detract from the whole experience.You are located within a short walk from the shopping dream (or hell) of Orchard road, but far enough away to be relaxing. The staff were attentive and helpful to a fault, with a breakfast buffet to cause weight gain just by looking at it, and just how often can they freshen your tea/coffee. A must see and stay experience and we will be returning for a longer stay hopefully next time.

<Content>Absolutely faultless! My experience in this Hotel was perfect. The service was attentive and impeccable, from checkin to breakfast. I must have been asked to top up my coffee at least ten times! The rooms are spacious, elegant and clean. The pools are beautiful- warm and sparkling, with excellent poolsider service. I thought the price compared to other Hotels in the areas was a bargain. The lcoation is also great- just around the corner from Orchard Rd. I would not take any notice of previous negative reviews, as I wonder if these people stayed at the same hotel as I did!

<Content>Just another hotel We stayed at Goodwood Park 3 days in a poolside suite. The hotel interior is rather old and everywhere a smell the reminded us of old 鈥榥 wet carpets. Internet services via TV where not working. Bathroom had only cheap toiletries that we would expect in a youth hostel. Business center was perfect but is not easy to access since always locked. The coffee lounge buffet offers the same mediocre food for lunch and dinner and has no alternating cold spreads and salads. Dinner at Gordon鈥檚 Highland Grill for two was $450 including lousy food and warm white wine. At least the service was skilled and polite. Overall a very unsatisfying culinary experience. Swimming pool area is okay but does not offer any privacy or shade. Concierge was very knowledgeable and friendly. We highly recommend the Night Safari tour and the DHL balloon.

<Content>A lovely hotel I'm beginning to wonder if some people's expectations are just unreasonable. This is a lovely hotel, people who stay here and complain must have to look hard to find problems. My room had recently been refurbished and was very spacious and comfortable. The main lobby with its cafe and patisserie were great for afternoon tea and a quick dinner. The buffet breakfast had a huge selection, with fresh omelettes made to order - my favourite. There are two pools and the smaller one is delightful and private, with trees and blooms all around. Staff were polite and helpful and arranged a treatment for me at the Aspara Spa, which is part of the hotel complex and it was sumptuous. Hotel is just off Orchard Road and near the metro station, a $15 cab ride to the airport. Perfect for a very comfortable stay and very reasonably priced when one is used to staying in tiny very average hotels in europe for the same price.

<Content>Dated hotel lacking investment This is a hotel which is very disappointing. One of the Grand old Dames of Singapore that attempts to be 5 star but a combination of lack of investment, poorly trained staff and disappointing food makes for an experience not worth sampling. There are far better alternatives elsewhere in the City. The one redeeming feature is its location.

<Content>Great location, stylish room I'm staying in the Park Lane Suites which are part of the Goodwood Park Hotel. Our room is a slightly pricier multi-storey appartment but really nice - modern, stylish, spacious and very clean. Nice to have a bit of privacy in an apartment rather than a hotel room. Discount for stays of 30 days or longer - good for those on business trips (like us). Haven't eaten in the restaurant but have been lazy enough to get room service a few times and each time has been pretty awful, but plenty of great places to eat all around this area so not a problem.

<Content>We'll be back! My wife and I absolutely loved the Goodwood Park. The service and cleanliness were excellent, great location, and a really nicely appointed suite for about $120US per night. We got there via a great deal found on one of the three big internet sites (the other two couldn't touch their rate, so it pays to look at the deals each one offers). Food and facilities were awesome and since we stayed at Goodwood for about 1/3 of the rate of the Raffles, I think it's where we'll head back again. The rooms were nicely appointed, spacious, comfortable, and designed with excellent taste.The concierge captain (Idiyl Ruben) was truly superb and sized us up perfectly after a few minutes of conversation. He made a couple of excellent recommendations for quick side trips that were real highlights of our stay. This was one of our best vacation stays ever and we'll be recommending it to friends and family with no small enthusiasm.

<Content>not fully satisfied My husband and I stayed at Goodwood Park last week for 3 nights. The room we got was a bit far from the reception. There was nothing special about it. The facilites provided in the room were very low, alonost no toileteries!!On our check out date, we had to leave very early in the morning, for breakfast the hotel offered to pack our 'breakfast' in a small box so we could take it with us. All there was in the box was a small bottle of juice, a small tuna sandwich (for breakfast!!!) and a croissant from the day before!!!!The only good thing about this hotel is its location because it is right in the heart of all the shopping centres which is quite nice.

<Content>Poor hotel I stayed at Goodwood Park last 2 days, booked over internet direct to hotel for poolside suite. Checked in room next to the pathway to pool and resturant, trolleys wheeled back and forth to resturant kept me awake untill 11pm each night, the room was smoking room which I did not ask for and smelt bad, I complained at 11pm about the trolley noise and receptionist hung up on me, I was very polite and asked to speak to the duty mgr when he hung up the phone.Ate at Gordon Grill, for two cost 500 sing $, service lousy, had to pour own wine and often no waiter in sight even though only 3 tables occupied.Bathroom had no toiletries as you would expect even in a 4 star hotel, the suite setup with 1 tv in lounge, there were cable slots for tv in bedroom but no tv.The staff and service unfriendly with exception of a couple individualsSo for 2 nights including the meal cost nearly US$900, an expensive never to be repeated experience

<Content>Pleasantly surprised My husband and I stayed at the Goodwood Park for a weekend in May. When we arrived, we could see renovations were underway and were a little bit worried about what state the hotel would be in. We were pleasantly surprised. We had booked over the net and on arrival, the staff upgraded us to a poolside suite (without us even asking). The suite was huge, with two bathrooms, and everything was well-appointed and spotless. We had a nice aspect over the second, smaller pool at the hotel.The location is perfect for shopping on Orchard Road and it's only a short walk to the MRT station. The breakfast buffet is nothing special but it's fine, and we ate one meal at Min Jiang and it was excellent - delicious modern Sichuan.The service was at all times efficient and friendly. Overall, we had a good experience.
