<Content>Modern and Clean with Pool I stayed in 3 properties while on my vacation in SF and I have to say that this was my favourite property, the one that I would choose to go back to. The upside of this hotel is that it is very modern and fairly new (built in 2000). It felt refreshing to be in the room, after a long day. It has a swimming pool and this is quite a rare find in the core SF area. The gym was also adequate. The room was spotlessly clean and the staff I encountered were professional and attentive. Complimentary internet access in the room was a plus, considering many of the hotels of this scale do charge. The bed was also comfortable and room was decent size. There is Starbucks on site, as well as Jasmine's for breakfast. There is also a bar and lounge called Whispers, great for business travelers looking for a drink in the evening.I think it's a great hotel for someone looking to be near the convention center (Moscone). It is also walking distance (8-15 min) to BART station and Westfield Shopping Center.Overall, a nice stay, I will stay at this hotel again when I'm in SF.

<Content>Great convention hotel I stayed here 4 nights for a scientific / medical convention. This was a great choice - it was $40-70/night cheaper ($50-90 when you consider internet access) than the bigger hotels next to the Moscone Convention Center but only 2.5 blocks away. The hotel is relatively new, and the rooms are large, newly decorated and comfortable. I had a king room with a sofa and coffee table. The room had a large flat screen TV and free wired internet. The only downsides were the small bathroom and the lack of view of my 6th floor room (it stared right into the offices across the street). The staff are friendly and competent. It is about 2.5 long city blocks from the nearest BART station and 10-15 min by foot to Union Square and 15 min to Chinatown.

<Content>Comfortable hotel near Moscone Convention Center My husband and I stayed in a suite at the Marriott Courtyard. It had a king bed in one room and a nice size sitting area in the other room. There was a door to close to the bedroom. I had to get up early for my conference and I could sleep while he stayed up. The price was the best I could find for a suite near the convention center. The staff was helpful. The seating area in the lobby was functional. There is a bar and a restaurant which was over priced as are most hotels.There is a Starbucks off the lobby and a tasty India restaurant across the street. It was a three block walk to the convention center. The whirlpool was not working in the hot tub. There is a nice little balcony with seating by the pool. We would definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>Management is tops We stayed at the Courtyard for the San Francisco Nike Women's Marathon. We found the staff, and bellmen specifically to be FAR above par. They went the extra mile in EVERYTHING to make sure that we enjoyed our experience and to ensure that we felt at home. They were very efficient with handling our luggage before check in and prior to check out. The hotel has a Starbucks in the lobby, a well kept work out facility, fresh complimentary water and coffee, and a VERY clean atmosphere. The beds were wonderfully comfortable. TV's are updated and a great size. The location is perfect. Within a mile walk of Fisherman's Wharf and the entire Pier experience...a streetcar ride away from all of the the listed above. A short walk to the well known Union Square shopping...and very central to all public transportation. The bellhops had superb directions/ maps, and more to offer on suggestion than most upscale concierge services even offer!

<Content>Excellent business choice I stayed at the Courtyard for four nights for a convention at the Moscone Center. I chose the Courtyard because it was less expensive than other business and branded hotels within a few blocks of the convention center. I booked through the Marriott website and had a rate of $199 per night.The hotel looks to be newer. Everything is clean and working perfectly. The lobby is inviting. My room was on the 8th floor and faced northwest. My room had a king-sized bed, a couch (pull-out sleeper), and a desk. The room was comfortable and had plenty of room. The bathroom was also larger than I expected, but it looks to be ADA compliant, hence the extra room. The bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of pillows.The hotel was quiet. I never heard any noise outside my room. The desk staff was friendly and helpful. Check-in was quick. I asked for a restaurant suggestions one night, and I was given several options from which to choose.The hotel is 2.5 blocks from the entrance to the Moscone Center. It's 3 blocks from Market Street and the Montgomery BART station. There are plenty of restaurants within a few blocks.While I think nearly $200 is a high price for a hotel room, this was cheaper than many rooms in the area, so I will consider it a good value based on the local market.I reserve giving a full 5 rating for truly exceptional stays and values, and this Courtyard comes very close. This hotel has easily earned my rating of 4 and then some. I would definitely stay here again. (CS)

<Content>great stay away from the crowd We stayed 5 nights in a one bedroom suite. We had the King bedroom and our teenage girls had a fold-out couch and roll-away in the sitting room. Plenty of room and other than a little street noise it was pretty quiet. Some neighboring guests decided to host a party at 4am one night and one call to the front desk shut them down pretty quick. There really are many good restaurants within walking distance if you look. The area was clean and as safe as any big city can be, much nicer than union square area. We bought muni passes and got around easily. The buses and underground were fastest. We hit the Starbucks every morning but baked goods are only delivered weekdays. One problem was wireless didn't work in the room so my husband had to take his laptop to the lobby to work. They had two computers for guests but there was always a line waiting and they caused nothing but bad feelings, if you were using. one someone was always giving you the evil eye waiting or vice versa. Most requests and questions were answered quickly. Pool area was small but nice. We had drinks and snacks in the lobby/bar/restaurant area and it was good.

<Content>Spacious, comfortable, in-city option Our room at the Marriott was, for an in-city hotel, very generously sized. We had 2 Q's plus a sofa bed: just perfect for our family that includes teens of opposite genders. The beds are lovely--comfie, great linens (all cotton, triple-sheeted) and the whole room was clean and showed that it's a relatively new place. The location was quieter than some places in the city, but a good 15-20 minute walk from Union Square. Not a problem for our long-legged kids but for little ones, it might be a hefty walk. The hill to the hotel is gentle however, especially compared to hotels on the other side of Market. There are not a lot of eating options in the neighborhood on weekends, as this is a part of town that seems to be where there is more activity Mon-Fri. We found the breakfast too pricey at the restaurant, but there is a Starbuck's in the lobby. We found a cute place in South Park, about 10 minutes walk, to have breakfast one day for about half the price of the hotel restaurant. The kids did order room service for dessert one evening and were pleased with the quality. Front desk staff busy and professional. Clerk named JP was super helpful in getting us the room configuration we needed. Cookies in late afternoon at front desk a bonus! We didn't know there was a pool at the hotel until we got there. A small indoor pool but the setting is nice, with a courtyard off the back. There was also a small excercise room. Parking is very expensive, compared with the rates at this hotel. The attendant told us it was $43/night plus about $6 in taxes--in and out privileges allowed via valet. Since we were not planning to use our car at all for 2 days, this seemed too high. We asked him for other options and he pointed to a building across the street that was $22 per day. No in/out privileges but good for just a safe place to stow the car. We did take our car out on Sunday (paid in the lobby of that building as the garage was closed to enter) and when we returned parked on the street in the same block as the hotel, which was free until 7 a.m Monday. Car was fine in the morning but the meter maid was waiting to make sure we but money in the meter!The Courtyard was a great choice for our family and a good value for the rate paid ($169/weekend AAA rate, booked 3 months in advance).

<Content>Nice Option Stayed here for 2 nights on business - I heard it was fairly new and the location seemed good. I thought the front desk/lobby area was very efficient and modern, although it always seemed to be noisy because of all the glass and marble floors, etc. Check-in was extremely efficient, I think I was in my room within 5 minutes of walking in the front door. The room was very spacious and one thing I really noticed was the excellent lighting, especially for business travel when you're working in your room at night! Big flat screen TV and very comfortable bed.The only complaint I had is that the walls are pretty thin - one night I was up all night because my next door neighbors were talking very loudly and coming in and out of their room (banging doors) - and I mean all night - til 5:30am. They weren't out-of-control partying, just loud, and I could hear it all! Didn't use the hotel restaurant or fitness center, but I am planning to return next month. Overall a good choice - good restaurants within a few blocks and easy access to taxis and public transport.

<Content>clean  We originally had a room booked at the Courtyard Fisherman's Wharf. They oversold the hotel and sent us to the Courtyard Downtown. The staff at the Courtyard Downtown was professional and processed our reservation quickly. The front desk gave us a good recommendation for a pizza delivery and upgraded us to a King Suite for our troubles at the Courtyard Fisherman's Wharf. We were very appreciative of his efforts. The King Suite was very large and clean. There is free internet access in the lobby. Prompt Valet service.

<Content>great hotel for family group of 5 We were a family group of 5, parents plus 3 older kids 18, 16, 12. The one bedroon suite offered was perfect for us for the 4 nights. Plenty big for comfort; bigger than average one-bed apt in Dublin. 2 rooms, living cum 2nd bedroom with microwave, fridge, sink, coffee machine. Bedroom had a comfortable king. Kids found fold out bed and roll-away bed in living room were comfortable too. A TV in each room which was fab. we were on holidays so not spending too much time in the room but all 5 of us were very pleased with the hotel. Staff absolutely first class. breakfast was only meal we had in hotel.opted for the buffet and it was grand. enough to tide us over until dinner really. walk to union square was about 20 mins.this didnt bother us.had no problem getting taxis if we needed and they were a reasonably priced option - outside of rush-hour anyway! We would stay here again and recommend it highly.

<Content>Great location and an indoor pool too! My family and I (wife and 6 yo son) stayed for 7 nights. We selected the hotel because of its proximity to Moscone Convention Center and the presence of a pool. The indoor pool was a big plus, because the weather in SF was about 50 degrees - the pool (and the fitness room) were well kept and opened very early (5 am for the pool) which was very helpful for travelers from the East Coast.Overall the facilities were clean and well maintained. Front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The room was clean with a decent view.The restaurant had a buffet breakfast which was good, although pricey. I ordered something off the menu (ie avoided the buffet) and it took quite a bit more time for preparation and did not come out very appetizing.The location was within a few blocks of Moscone and a few blocks of Market Street. It was about a 15 minute walk (25 minutes with a 6 yo) from the Ferry Building.

<Content>Perfect location, good weekend value I've stayed at this hotel numerous times when visiting San Francisco on weekends. It is typically a great weekend value compared to other San Francisco hotels, it is clean, there's free WiFi, a Starbucks downstairs, and really the location cannot be beat - 3 blocks from BART/Muni, and Market St. Many of the rooms have great downtown views too.As someone else noted, the gym is not worth going to unless you are a cardio-only person.

<Content>Not bad Courtyard (by Marriott) is located just north of the Moscone convention centre. It is still a distance to walk compared to other hotels such as Intercontinental, Marriott and W Hotel.It is near to the financial district but further to Union Square compared to many other hotels but it is within walking distance to Market Street where you can take streetcars, trains, buses etc. It is possible to walk to Union Square and chinatown though.The hotel is near offices and it is quiet unlike hotels near union square where you can hear cable cars and sirens etc. The rooms are simple. You don't get a fridge but they do have a nice flat screen TV. Internet is part of the room rate (at least for me, which is good for business travellers)I was staying at the Hotel Nikko. I thought it was cheaper and clearly better. Having said that, Courtyard by all means is a decent hotel too.The beds are comfortable with good pillows.I didnt try any restaurants in the hotel. So cannot comment on the food.Front desk provides prompt and acceptable services.

<Content>Clean, good food but gym rats beware I stayed here for a business trip for 2 nights in June. It seems rather newly refurbished or built as the bathrooms have granite and the TV is a flat screen. It was a pretty standard courtyard but the food (dinner) was better than most courtyards. However the food was pricey. The breakfast buffet was 20 bucks and nothing extraordinary. My only real complaint was the gym. It was smaller than my hotel room and had 3 cardio machines, two weight machines and some dumbells. The pool was tiny as well (not a lap pool). So long as your not the buisness type that likes to workout not a big deal. Tip: If you are new to San Fran and would like a view of the Golden Gate bridge while dining there are actually very few choices. The one I tried was Greens at the Fort Mason Center building A. It's about a $15 cab ride away. It's a vegitarian restaurant so it won't be for everyone the food was excellent and the view was amazing.

<Content>Not a bad stay I stayed in this hotel with my family while attending JavaOne 2008. There are a lot of positives for this hotel and a few disappointments.Positives 1- It's in a great location. Easy to get on to I 80 and head to Oakland, easy to get to the water front and easy to get to 101 to head to Silicon valley. It's also a nice walk to the Moscone Center 2- We could sleep 5 comfortable in the room (2 queens and a sofa-bed) 3- Great price. For the other hotels in the area, this was a good value. 4- Helpful front desk staffDisappointments 1- The poll is small. The deepest end is 3.5 feet (yes, just a little more than a meter). The shallow end is 3 feet 2- Parking is expensive. $50/night once you include taxes 3- 2 of the 5 nights we had to call housekeeping to get sheets for the sofa-bed. One time it took 3 hours for them to arrive 4- The day we arrived the street that the main entrance was on was closed making it very difficult to get to the hotel.

<Content>Ok Hotel Hotel is located on a very busy roads, we were on the 11th floor and were awoke by road noise each morning - early!! Not very nice when you are on holidays. Tried to use Marriott Uk Pound vouchers on check-in which the clerk stated they did not accept - strange as the vouchers state they are accepted at 2600 hotels. After pointing this out the clerk who referred this to the FO manager Barbara who said that they did not accept foreign currencies etc but would check with their accounts dept on Monday 2 days after my checkin and get back to me. An international hotel in downtown SFO not accepting foreign currancies strange - especially as they were vouchers issued by Marriott themselves. Eventually they were accepted but at a rip off rate of 1.79$ to 1拢. Would not stay again due to location. Only stayed here as the SFO Marriott was undergoing a refurbishment and did not want to be woken by noise in the morning.Breakfast was ok and staff friendly in the restaurant. which only opened for breakfast. Very limited restuarant service for dinner in the bar area with very poor seating and tv's showing sports channels.Noticed parking very expensive( seems to be typical in SFO hotels) - try parking in local lots near the hotel which are just down the street and cheaper.Booked a suite which was basic but spacious. Was told it had been just refurbished - but had stains on the furniture and curtains. Bathroom was very basic for a suite.

<Content>Wonderful Stay I had a very pleasant stay at the Courtyard Marriott. Though SF is known for its boutique hotels, I was skeptical of staying at an independent hotel after reading some of the reviews on here. I'm very pleased with my decision! Though a little pricier than other hotels, the extra money is worth it to be in a clean room and a great location. The lobby staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful (the concierge held my luggage while I went out for a meal and called me a car service when I left). I stayed in a queen room on the 12th floor, and my room was very spacious with an excellent view. I couldn't hear any street noise. The bed was really comfy (Courtyards are known for this!) and the shower pressure was great. My room was well-cleaned every day and new linens are always available upon request. Though there aren't many extra frills, I felt the Courtyard provided great value for the money.Best of all, the hotel is very conveniently located -- just a few blocks from public transport, and within walking distance of the SFMOMA, Yerba Buena Center, Ferry Building, cable cars, and lots of good shopping  restaurants.The only complaint I have is that they seemed to be doing work on the floor above me. After a delayed arrival late at night, I had been looking forward to sleeping in, but a loud banging noise woke me up at 9 am. However, this seemed to be an isolated incident, as it was only an issue for one morning, and the rest of my stay more than made up for this minor inconvenience. I would certainly recommend this hotel!

I've stayed at this hotel several times now; the value is great, there's some great restaurants very close by, and it's always clean and the staff are first rate.

<Content>Clean, Comfortable, Great location My boyfriend and I stayed at the Marriot December 27 - December 31, 2007.I am originally from the Bay Area (East Bay) and enjoy flying back to San Francisco for the fun city/tourist attractions.That being said, I did not want to stay near Fisherman's Wharf as it is a little 'too touristy' for me...but I didn't want to stay in a desolate part of the city either.I was EXTREMELY impressed with the Courtyard Marriot. The lobby is clean, modern, and feels brand new. Starbucks also shares the lobby with the hotel which is convenient and an added bonus. The rooms are spacious with a King bed, loveseat, desk, coffee table, dresser, etc. I had no complaints with the room.It was only a 5-7 minute walk to Union Square and other attractions. We walked down the street and found plenty to eat also. Bodin bread bowls, local taverns, etc. It took us only 10 minutes to walk to the W hotel for a trendy cocktail for happy hour and other upscale martini bars. It is easy walking places because there is so much to see while doing so. Late at night we took a taxi back to the hotel which is very inexpensive.It is a great hotel considering you will pay the same amount of money (if not more) for an older, rundown, outdated hotel near the wharf/Union Square areas. This hotel is extremely clean and well worth the price.I will definitely stay here again when returning to the city!

<Content>surprisingly luxurious Courtyard by Marriott as a brand is schizophrenic: In the suburbs, they offer a bland, standard experience, but some of their big city hotels approach luxury. I've now stayed in two that surprised me: this hotel and a Courtyard in Philadelphia located in an historic building that was formerly a courthouse.The Courtyard San Francisco downtown is located in the uber-trendy South of Market district, surrounded by dot com businesses. It's walking distance to the Ferry Building and Union Square, but barely. (warning: I walk all over San Francisco and think Fisherman's Wharf is walking distance from downtown, so I've attempted to put myself in your walking shoes while writing this review.)Unlike suburban Courtyards, they offer room service, a lobby restaurant and bar, and even a Starbucks. In other words, expect a big-city hotel experience. Of course that also means you'll pay extra for parking and internet.Courtyard has entered the signature bed competition, and while theirs is not as nice as Westin's Heavenly Bed, theirs was a definite upgrade from hotel standard and quite comfy.I picked this hotel for one reason - price. But now that I've stayed there, I'd go back for the service.

<Content>Great Stay even with construction! This hotel was great for location for downtown but if you are shopping or going to restaurants its not a good choice for location. We were very pleased with the staff and the cleaniness of the whole property. There were a few stains on the couch and chair in the room but that is expected with normal wear and tear on the rooms. I thought the Front Desk staff was great. Check in was fast and easy. We did not know at the time of booking the resrevation that there was construction going on so they infromed us at check in. I would have never known about it if they didn't tell us. There was no noise and not a sight of construction workers there. We would come back to this hotel any time. I think the only thing that was outrageously ridiculous was the cost of parking. I think it was $40 for one night. Crazy!But all in all it was a wonderful stay!

<Content>Very nice! We are just back from a 4 night stay at the Courtyard. We took the Bart from SFO and walked with our suitcases 3 blocks on a slight incline to the hotel. The hotel is very clean and nice, we had 2 adults and 2 teens in a King Suite, there was plenty of room. We had a great view, the bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean and neat. The staff was also very helpful. My only complaint is the noise from the outside. We were on the 14 floor facing 2nd Ave, the sirens, car horns and construction noises in the morning and during rush hour was horrible. Directly in front of the hotel is the route to the bay bridge, this is where all of the traffic comes from, there is also lots of construction going on in the immediate area. Other than the outside noise, I would recommend the Courtyard

<Content>Great stay at the Courtyard San Francisco Downtown My wife and I were attending a conference at the Moscone centre, and this hotel was the cheapest within the region ($250), likely because it is a few blocks away from the real action (Union Square, Westfield Shopping Mall, Moscone centre). However, if you are capable of walking a few blocks (5-10 minutes) you can reach all of the above very easily, and we quite liked the location. We took the BART train from the S.F. airport, and got off at Montgomery St station, which was a four block walk from this hotel. Even with baggage this wasn't bad. I went for a run a couple of times - just headed down Folsom St for a few blocks and was at the Embarcadero which is great for jogging.As mentioned in many previous reviews, we were genuinely impressed with the service offered here. Very helpful staff. We did not eat at the hotel's restaurant at all, because we had other plans. There is a Starbuck's right inside the hotel lobby, which was handy for a quick breakfast.The room was huge - especially for San Fran! The big bathroom was also very much appreciated.In contrast to a previous poster, we did not have any technological gadgets in our room. Just a plain (non-flat screen) TV. The free Internet was nice, and the Ethernet cable is in the closet.Overall, we were impressed with this hotel, and we would return, especially if for another conference at the Moscone Centre. That being said, if shopping is your thing, other hotels are much closer to Union Square. We had to take a cab back to our hotel a couple of times since we had so much stuff!

<Content>Great Location, Great Comfort My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights so he could attend the dental convention at the Moscone Center. This hotel was perfectly located for him to walk to the convention, and for me to walk to public transportation in order to visit all the touristy sights of San Francisco. We loved being in the center of town, and I loved being walking distance to the Tram buses that went to the wharves (including the Ferry Building and Pier 39) and, of course, the Cable Cars. Buy yourself a 3 day pass for the MUNI bus/tram/cable car system while you are there for $18. Now for the hotel itself: the staff was extremely kind and helpful. We had breakfast every morning at the hotel restaurant. They are very efficient, and very willing to go out of their way to get you what you want (we shared a breakfast 2 mornings as the portions are generous). The front desk staff greeted me every time I walked back in the door from my touring around. Even the maid stopped to thank me for leaving her a tip. The room itself was large for San Francisco, with 2 queen beds, a couch, desk, etc. Very clean. Bed was extremely comfortable, which for me means, not as hard as a rock. Wanted a view room, but they were packed. Never heard a sound from the rooms on either side of us. Free internet (cable is in a plastic bag hanging in the closet). Overall an excellent experience in San Francisco. If you are planning a visit, go in October. We've been there twice at that time of year and the weather is excellent. Sunny and 70 most of the time we were there. Have fun!

<Content>Clean, Comfortable and in a safe area I stayed at the Courtyard Sept 27-30 for a business trip. It was the weekend of the ADA Convention so the room was $354 a night! The room was typical Courtyard style with not much frills. The pictures on the web showed flat screen tv's and modern furniture...I had two different rooms and neither looked like the pictures. Both rooms had regular tv's and plain looking furniture. Although I must say both rooms were spotless and very quiet.The hotel is in a pretty good location, several blocks from good shopping (Westfield mall) and about 4 blocks to Moscone. If you are going to SanFran for a convention at Moscone I reccomend the W, the Westin Market St, or the Marriott. All are MUCH closer to Moscone......I tried to get in these places but all were booked. If you can get a good rate and have great walking shoes, I would recommend this hotel. But it wasn't worth $350 a night when they are plenty of other great hotels in the city.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! This hotel is a terrific place to stay. It's relatively affordable and is walking distance to the ferry/farmers market. It's also near a Bart station. I love how the rooms are huge! We got a king size bed and there was an area for a pull out sofa bed. The bathrooms were extremely clean. The front desk staff and valet attendants are very friendly-- you could tell that the hotel values customer service. The rooms are quiet, and their amenities are great. They have a pool and a jacuzzi (although the jacuzzi wasn't working when I was there, boo), an exercise room and a restaurant and bar.I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in downtown San Francisco!

<Content>High-Tech Amenities I stayed at the Courtyard San Francisco Downtown for a few days in August 2007. The rooms are clean and large for city standards (300+ sq. feet). The bathrooms are unusually large. The toilet is at least 3-4 feet from the shower, which is a nice change from those closet bathrooms. The sink area (only one sink) is outside of the bathroom, but has space to put your toiletries. The room has air conditioning and the view is decent (I had a city view). There is a sofa bed in the room too (full size bed).The best part of this hotel is the high-tech gadgets. My room had a flat panel LCD HDTV. Internet service is free, but make sure you bring your own Ethernet cable because they didn't provide one in the room. The desk is huge. It has a pull-out desk which pulls out from under the main desk. You can place your laptop and a stack of papers on the pull-out desk and still have room on the main desk behind it to store even more papers, etc. The office chair is very comfortable too. The back of the desk has a power, A/V and network/phone panel. You can plug a phone cable, ethernet cable, audio and video (RCA jacks, audio mini-plug, S-video, HDMI and VGA) plugs, 4 power plugs, and a USB port into that panel. The clock radio is modern and you can plug in your IPOD into it.Since the hotel is on 2nd and Folsom, it is not in the middle of the tourist area. If you want to be in downtown/Union Square area, try the Marriott on 4th and Mission St., the Four Seasons, the Palace Hotel, etc. However, you will be paying at least 2x more. Union Square is walking distance away (about 8 long blocks) and the Metreon/Moscone Center is about 4 blocks away. There are some great restaurants near the hotel. Try Bong Su (Vietnamese Fusion) and Cha Am (Thai) on 3rd and Folsom, Mehfil (Indian) across the street, Osha (Thai) on 2nd between Folsom and Howard), Azie (Asian fusion) and Lulu (Mediterranean) on Folsom between 4th and 5th.

<Content>Wonderful, Modern, Lovely Stay We spent two nights at the Courtyard in San Francisco and really enjoyed our stay. The staff was polite and very accomadating. Our room (we were in a king suite) was perfect for our family. It had a large sitting room with a modern-looking sofa bed, lounging sofa (which also could be made into a bed), as well as a large seperate bedroom with a king and a bathroom with two sinks, as well as a seperate shower/toilet area. The sitting room had a nice LCD, flatscreen, TV in it, and the bedroom also had a TV. The pool was nice and kept clean and the exercise room was well equipped with great workout machines (each of the treadmills, stairsteppers and bicycles had there own TVs built into them). We ate breakfast at Jasmine's on both days of our stay. The buffet was always fresh and delicious. The location is in the business district of San Francisco, but we walked to the farmer's market and piers, but it was a bit of a hoof . For those who aren't walkers, cable cars and buses are a short stroll from the front entrance. For those not wanting to eat at the hotel restaurant, San Francisco has great cuisine that definitely needs to be had. During our visits to the city in the past, we've enjoyed great Chinese food (China Town), as well as lots of other ethinic types. Across the street from the Courtyard is a great Indian restaurant whose name I forget, but it's literally across the street and can't be missed. In the Ferry Building in the Slanted Door. We decided to dine at this hip Thai restaurant. It was delicious. It's not cheap, but we found it definitely worth the splurge. The Courtyard is very up to date with wonderful staff and all at relatively good price. We'll be back!

<Content>Quiet, relaxing and friendly Stayed at the hotel for a long business/pleasure weekend and was very impressed. The property is very clean and upscale, while the staff is friendly and accommodating. Room service was the fastest I've ever experienced at a hotel and offered a nice selection for breakfast and dinner.Room wise, the plasma TV was great and the mini-fridge (as opposed to a stocked mini-bar) is fantastic...allows you to keep what you want (there's a nice liquor store right across the street from the entrance for stocking it).The one thing I did notice was that the mattresses are not very firm. Not a problem for me personally, but it wasn't to my partner's liking.Yes, parking is expensive, but it's SF. Every time I called for my car, it was there in less than 5 minutes, so that was great.Overall, it was a great place to stay, just a short (about 10-minute) walk from Market Street and Union Square.

Nicole made sure we were happy with our room and changed our locatin, at our request, to a different floor. Our room was always clean and beds were wonderful. The only hotel that we found with 2 queen beds. We found the location ok, because we used public transportion and had to walk several blocks to catch a bus.A wonderful stay.

<Content>Great Location and Great Service! Great Hotel, and Great Location! My husband and I used Marriott points to stay at the Courtyard this past Saturday and could not have been happier with the room and the service. The room was basic and standard for a Marriott. However, the location cannot be beat. The hotel is blocks away from the Sony Metreon Center, the Moscone Center, and the new SF Ballpark. Our favorite thing about the neighborhood is the fact that there are several great microbreweries just blocks away. The pool is a nice feature at the hotel, but it was too packed with screaming brats for us to enjoy. Overall a great find of a hotel in SF.

<Content>Great Service, Expensive Parking I stayed here for business for 3 nights. The rooms were great, the location was great, and the staff was excellent. My only complaint was the $30/night parking fee. I know parking is a premium in San Fran, but when it costs a 4th of what you are paying for the room, that is a bit ridiculous.

<Content>Loved the Courtyard We've stayed at Courtyard's before but this one was really great. Nice lobby,outside courtyard  lounge. The restaurant was pretty expensive for what you get  the waiter wasn't very good either. We liked breakfast from Starbucks better, which is located by the front desk.The employees at the front desk were helpful  friendly, especially Richard. We asked for a refrigerator  one was brought to our room right away.As others have mentioned the location is great, especially for the price of the rooms. Our room was spacious,quiet  very clean (12th flr). View wasn't great but we were only there to sleep.You can't go wrong staying here

<Content>Awesome Hotel and Location I stayed here the 1st weekend in March and enjoyed a unsually warm SF weekend. The hotel is extremely clean and in a great location. It is within walking distance to the new shopping mall, Union Square, Moscone, SOMA district, museums and Chinatown.There is a small indoor pool, nice courtyard on the lower level, along with a restaurant and Starbucks. Everyone working at the hotel was very nice. Valet parking is $40 per day, in a covered garage. Worth the fee since parking is difficult to find in the area. I would stay here again next time I visit SF, especially since the price is so reasonable!

<Content>loved the Marriott Courtyard on 2nd  This is not only a better than average hotel but the location was great too. We booked through Expedia (air  hotel combo) so it was a great price. It is only 3 blocks from Market and a10 minute walk from Union Square (major shopping area). We ate in the bar/restaurant and had a good meal. The Starbucks hours of operation are less than appealing but that didn't diminish our feelings about the hotel. VERY comfortable beds (they have just upgraded all of the beds) and ample sized rooms. The workout room is great but you have to get there early.The whole experience at the hotel was delightful.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location We stayed here two nights over a weekend and at $90 a night in the center of SF you really can't beat it. It was super clean, comfortable and with excellent Marriott service. I've stayed at other hotels in the area and paid a lot more and gotten a lot less. Last time we paid the same amount and didn't even have a private bath! We will definitely stay here again. I think during the week it is more expensive due to it being a business hotel. We got a weekend rate. Highly recommended hotel. The only downside is that parking costs $40 plus tax! Crazy. But we beat this by parking in another part of the city for free and got to the hotel on foot. We used the extra $40 on dinner.

Fortunately, Marriott Corp. has a Best Price Guarantee where they will honor the lower rate, and take an additional 25% off. My room ended up to be $67 per night ($77.10 with all taxes).Pros:1) Free high-speed internet (cables are in the closet).2) Clean basic room3) Prompt front desk, with numerous agents to help.4) Speedy elevator5) Starbucks in the lobby6) 3-4 city blocks to the BART  Muni lines.7) Liquor store across the st., 24 Hour gym, Quiznos within steps of the lobby.8) Speedy check-outCons:1) As with all hotels, egg breakfast is $17.99

<Content>Great place to stay in SOMA I stayed at the Courtyard Downtown for six nights during a business trip. The hotel is nicely located, a few blocks south of Market Street and an easy walk to the financial district, Union Square, and the Embarcadero. It is a surprisingly nice hotel for the price, especially so close to downtown San Francisco. The whole place feels brand new and is very clean and bright throughout. The rooms themselves are big and comfortable, and well appointed with little touches like free high-speed internet and Bath  Body Works products. The front desk staff were also extraordinarily helpful and friendly. The airline lost my bag on the flight over, and the front desk staff was very accomodating with the various packages from FedEx and the airline that I had to receive over the first few days as I was waiting for my bag to be delivered. The only drawback to the hotel is that there aren't a lot of services, like pharmacies and restaurants, on the immediate surrounding block. The walk from Market Street back to the hotel is also a little quiet at night, but never felt unsafe.I highly recommend the Courtyard Downtown for anyone looking for a nice, modern hotel at a much lower price than comparable hotels in the neighborhood.

<Content>great convention location I had a very nice stay at this hotel for a convention at the Moscone Center. I don't like fancy or glitzy, so this place was just my speed. The room was clean, really big, great price for its perfect location-- safe, and a short walk to work. The longer walk to shopping/restaurants at Union Square was a good way to stretch my legs after a hard day's work. I highly recommend the Umbria Restaurant a block way. The pool and hot-tub were great, good exercise room, too. Free internet service a huge plus. The bellmen were exceptionally helpful, even arranging a car to deliver my luggage to where I'd be working late in the day (not at Moscone) and take me directly to the airport, so that I did not need to return to the hotel to p/u luggage. I work in SF a couple times a year and will definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great value in downtown Wow! This was a fabulous hotel in the heart of the city. Located in a relatively new area of SF close to the China Basin and within walking distance of the heart of downtown, cable cars, and public transportation. The accomodations were wonderful. I thought we were staying at a five star hotel.Only slight downside is that you will walk 4-5 blocks to get to most tourist areas but that is expected in SF and actually is part of the fun part of being there. If you are attending a Giants game this is the place to stay (only 10 minute walk) and very safe.Hotel accomodations are great. Nice and comfortable rooms, nice indoor pool (which is hard to find in SF), and Starbucks right in the lobby. Lots of restaurants and nightlife in the vicinity.Would recommend this to anyone.

<Content>Very Nice Courtyard My husband and I stayed at the Courtyard for 3 nights in October. We were in town for a conference and didn't want to stay at the two main hotels for the conference. Courtyard was our 2nd choice, but we were happy with our pick. This Courtyard is one of the largest that I've stayed at and I thought it was slightly more upscale. There is a pool and gym- small but adequate. Our room overlooked a courtyard, was a nice size and the furnishings were in good condition. The one negative was that the walls are a bit thin.........Staff was very friendly and helpful. The weather was wonderful, so my husband didn't mind the 5-10 minute walk to the Moscone Center for the conference. The Courtyard was a 10-15 minute walk to the Ferry Building and Union Square.All in all, we were very happy with our stay. We would stay there again and would recommend it.

<Content>Short but sweet stay I, my sister, and our husbands stayed at this hotel as part of a whirlwhind tour of CA. We only stayed for 1 night, but the hotel was a very pleasant surprise.First, this Courtyard feels more like a full-service Marriott in that it is in a single, high-rise building. It is a very busy hotel, but service was very good.Our room was a 1 bedroom suite. It was extremely large, and very comfortable. The layout was a bit strange in that the access to the bathroom was through the bedroom portion of the suite. Accordingly, the privacy of the bedroom was somewhat diminished.The king-sized bed in the bedroom was very comfortable. Furnishings throughout the suite were in excellent condition. Carpets were very clean, and the suite itself felt very clean. Sofa pull-out bed was fairly comfortable.The living room portion of the suite was large, with a fridge and large bar area. We order room service, which came promptly and was tasty for hotel food. Prices were about average for hotel and the area in general.The lobby area always feels extremely busy. There is a Starbucks in the lobby; it too was busy, busy.In short, this was a good hotel, with most of the amenities available in a full-service Marriott. I would not be surprised if Marriott ceased operating this as a Courtyard location. I would stay here again.

<Content>The place to stay! We were supposed to stay at the Warwick Regis, but they were 'double booked' so they sent us to the Courtyard by Marriott. We were very happy with the vallet, the front desk and the cleanliness and shape of the room. The front desk was very accomodating for all of our needs. When they realized we were sent from another motel and that we were on our honeymoon, they set us up with a room with a gorgous view of the city. They were perfect for answering questions about tourist sites, they let us check out late and the vallet let us leave our car there 2 hours later than we should have. The vallet even took items to and from our car for us. If I ever travel to San Francisco again, I will be staying at this motel.

<Content>Good location The bad first: We stayed two nights and were shocked by the cost of parking at the hotel - $38 a day. We did so anyway, since we were told by the valet that nearby outdoor parking lots required us to move the car out at 6:30 every morning and there was no street parking available. We didn't want the hassle.Now for the good: The hotel is located in a busy area of downtown but not in the center which is a 10 minute walk. The decor of the lobby was nice and clean and check-in was easy. Our room didn't have a view but it was comfortable and cozy. The concierge was friendly and helpful in recommending nearby places to eat and we enjoyed getting our coffee at the downstairs Starbucks every morning. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay, except for the parking fee sticker shock. The best thing to do is not to drive into downtown San Francisco if possible. We would stay here again if we didn't drive.

<Content>Safe and friendly Our family (2 adults and 2 teenagers) stayed here for 3 nights at the end of July. The room was fairly typical and nothing special but it was clean. The hotel is in a very safe area and we felt perfectly happy walking around at night. The staff were incredibly helpful. The hotel has interesting touches around the lobby, bar and lounge areas which are copper/brass items placed around, e.g. a pair of slippers in front of the fire and a cat curled up. The pool was very nice (if smaller than I expected) and there was a small terrace outside that overlooks the central courtyard. The courtyard itself was a pleasant place to sit and all the public areas were well kept up. We didn't eat in the hotel as it was expensive but there were lots of places within walking distance to eat at. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>A little better than your typical Courtyard I'm a big fan of Marriott properties and have stayed at Courtyard hotels all over the west coast. While I usually like Courtyard, I loved this property.While most courtyard hotels are 3-4 stories, this Courtyard is 18+ stories tall. It does have a courtyard area, and the rooms facing the courtyard are very quiet, with no street or traffic noise. For some reason, if your room faces the courtyard, you cannot open the windows. However, if your room faces the noisy street below, you can open your windows.The check in area is more nicely appointed than most courtyards. The breakfast/restaurant area is better too, and includes an omelet bar and waiter service that is more typical in a restaurant than in the courtyard. Unlike most courtyard hotels, this property has room service that will prepare and deliver hot meals. They have a business center that allows you to access the internet and print pages free of charge.We stayed in one of their courtyard facing rooms for one night and then moved to a street facing suite for the second night (because I like fresh air and wanted to open the windows). Both rooms were nicely appointed and clean, but there was noticable street noise from the second room, even on the 15th floor. Unlike most courtyard properties, both rooms offered a heating and AC system that was more like a residential unit, as opposed to the in wall system that you typically find in a Courtyard property. This was important to me because the in wall systems are quite noisy, while the system in both rooms were very quiet. Both rooms were a bit small compared to what a Courtyard usually offers, but the room size was quite typical for SF at a more reasonable price.Be warned that they charge about $45 per day for valet parking ($38 plus tax, I think) and have no self-parking, but this is typical of all downtown San Francisco hotels. The per person breakfast charge was higher than most courtyards ($18 per head), but children under 12 eat free. In SF, everything is more expensive, so I was willing to forgive both.In all, I liked this property a lot. The decor was modern, clean, and pleasant. The amenities exceeded the typical Courtyard amenities. The price was quite reasonable for San Francisco, which is generally a very expensive City to stay in.

<Content>Just another Courtyard on the inside Let me start by saying that I stayed here using Marriott Rewards Points from July 20 to July 23, 2006. So I cannot judge the value of my stay.If you have seen one Courtyard hotel room, you have seen them all. Furnishings were fairly new but uninspiring. Bathroom was basic. Sink area was too small for two people. Typical Courtyard with basic features. Nothing new to report about this Courtyard.The property itself is kept very clean. Check-in was a breeze. Although, I did request to be upgraded to a suite but the front desk clerk informed me that they were completely booked. I did not challenge the clerk, but I logged on the Marriott website before arriving and it showed availability for suites during my stay. I am an elite member and they choose to ignore my request. We had a nice City View with a view of they pyramid building on the 14th floor.Soap and shampoo were no name brands unlike other Marriott properties which use Bath and Body Works products. If you are picky about hair products like I am, be sure to bring your own.The Courtyard is in easy walking distance to ATT Park and the Muni/BART Station (15 to 20 minutes). If you are walking from the Muni/BART Station, I recommend walking on the north side of 2nd Street. For some reason, this side is more developed and nicer. The homeless tend to stay on the southside during the evenings. Union Square is one Muni/BART station away.We found a great Thai restuarant on 2nd street a couple blocks away called Osha. Roys is also a couple blocks away also. Starbuck in lobby is convenient but hours limited. You can charge your drinks and food to your room.To summarize, a typical Courtyard. Room very clean and comfortable. Free wired internet in the rooms.

<Content>Great for family of 4 Definitely excellent choice for families if you have a car. Stayed for two nights over a weekend at the Courtyard. For $169 on Marriott got a 2 room suite, corner room. It is true that the location is safe but not in the middle of all the expected tourist locations....so it was very nice to have our car. The location was also very quiet which is great for napping toddlers. Could see SBC park where the Giants play from our window, about 5 blocks away. Room very clean, service prompt and extremely friendly. Front desk personnel almost overcome with sorrow that they only had one serving of free Colgate toothpaste...no problem just used the kids' that we had brought. Restaurant personnel engaging, unobtrusive. Although the breakfast buffet was expensive ($19/person), selection great and they didn't charge us for the kids! Room service excellent, prompt and in line with what one expects room service pricing. After exhaustive research for us the best deal for 2 room suite with a door between us and our kids. Only downside $37/day valet parking (seems to be pretty standard for the area). Will definitely stay there next time I'm in town.

<Content>Great Location, Awesome Beds Stayed here the weekend of June 9th, 2006. Great location, close to all forms of public transportation, we didn't have to rent a car. Take the BART from the airport. Three blocks from hotel. Starbucks in the lobby. Rooms were very clean and the beds were unbelievably comfortable. Spent most of the time seeing the city so this hotel was perfect for us. Close to great shopping and restaurants. Great rates as well. Would definitely go back.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Just got back from one night in SF at this hotel. Good location (although many hotels in this area are near to everything, so don't choose this just because of location). Excellent staff--very courteous. Stayed on the top floor (18) with a nice view. Room was spacious and clean, all you could ask for. Price was significantly better than other hotels--actually booked on priceline bid and stayed for about 75$ including tax--see ----. Market St was only 4 blocks away (about a 5-10 min walk), then you can take a street car (1.50$) down to fisherman's wharf to see that area. Otherwise, all the shopping, etc. is near to the hotel.

<Content>Great location and quiet Spent a week in May 2006. Great location, came directly from the SFO airport using the BART because the Montgomery station is only 4 blocks from the hotel. Only 10 minutes walk from the Cable Car, 5 minutes from the streetcar and buses on Market street. Overall it was a very convenient location. Rooms are simple but spacious and very clean. And QUIET. Did not here a thing all 7 nights we stayed there. Breakfast buffet is good and practical for an early start to explore the city. Staff is very courteous and friendly. Used a safety deposit box at the reception desk for passports, there are no safes in the rooms ( minor detail). No fees . Great thai restaurant 2 blocks from the hotel ( Osha Thai Restaurant ). It's opened late even on weekdays. Excellent food.Enjoyed our stay and will recommend it to others. A good value for the money paid. A little bit more expensive than other hotels around but it was worth it for the tranquility, location, nice rooms and friendly staff.

<Content>Great Location This is a great little hotel. We were there for 1 night on a weekend. The location is the best, and we had a great veiw from the 10th foor. The King bed was nice and comfortable and the room clean. I had a good sleep and the hotel was quiet. It was so convenient to be able to walk to the Metreon and Union Square. They do have a Starbucks in the lobby, but I never got to take advantage of it because it was always closed. I don't know what the hours are during the week, but on Sat., it closed by 3 pm, and then on Sunday by noon. I believe that they only stay open for breakfast. Anyway, we had a great stay and I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved the Courtyard at Downtown We stayed there last week of March-first week of April 2006. Incredibly great hotel. Service is excellent. We arrived late at 12.00 A.M., already let them know while booking. The front desk person was very helpful. We asked a high floor room with a view if possible. He gave us a room on 18th Floor-with VIEW!! And he also asked us if we had dinner, we were really late, he gave us the menu for a nearby pizza place and Chinese res if we want to order and have it delivered. Great. Room was really CLEAN and SPACIOUS! The hotel is in a great location itself. Only few blocks from Market street, Union Square is probably 15-20 min short walk (depending on how fast you walk!!). Oh and also China Town is not that far too! Once you are in Union Square add another 10 min of walking! We went there walking. BART station is only 4/5 blocks away, Montegemry(sp?) station. If you don't have much luggege you don't even need to waste money on cab fare to airport. We took BART to Oakland Intl' Airport! And it cost us for 2 $10.70, in cab it should have been $60.00!!! And to SFO (SF Int'l Airport) the fare was $40.00, so you save HUGE!! So yeah the hotel has the added bonus of being in a great location! All in all a great hotel. Definitely we will stay there again and again!!

<Content>Lovely and Reliable Had a lovely one-night stay in the Courtyard Marriot in SF's SoMA district. The streets around it are rather dead on the weekend, but it still felt safe and was quiet at night. Good views from the 12th floor. Room very...roomy..and clean, of course. Hotel staff was very very courteous and accomodating (early check-in, luggage storage, etc.) Starbucks in the lobby was wonderful for a quick breakfast before heading out in the morning. Only a short walk (4 blocks) from Market St. and Union Sq also close by. SFMOMA, Yerba Buena Gardens, Sony Metreon all around the corner. Take the BART from the airport...the station is not too far of a walk. Oh, and great Thai restaurant on 2nd st. just steps from the hotel. Overally a very reliable choice for staying in the city.

<Content>Great place, great location! My wife and I stayed at the San Fran Courtyard Downtown for two nights this past week and it was just amazing! Now, given, it's not the Ritz, but if you're looking for a great place to mix business with pleasure it was ideal. The entrance to the bay bridge was just few blocks away for me to make some work appointments on the east bay and Union Square was just a very safe 8 block walk for my wife to do some shopping. We even made the 15-20 block walk down to Pier 39 and it was an easy 25 minutes. The rooms were clean and comfortable, everything you'd expect from a Courtyard. The breakfast buffet is a must, $9 a piece, but you'll be so full you'll skip lunch.

<Content>Great time at the Courtyard We stayed at the Courtyard for 5 nights at the end of October / beginning of November and we really liked it.Our room on the 11th floor was very spacious - 2 double beds - nicely decorated and very tasteful. The beds were comfortable but perhaps a little soft for our tastes.Room was immaculate every day.Staff helpful.Location excellent - 10 minute walk to Union Square. Fantastic Thai Restaurant - OSHA - a couple of blocks down.Only gripe was the Starbucks - we arrived at 6pm on a Thursday and it was shut - very limited opening hours.Overall - very impressed. We got the room for 拢60 a night through Octopus Travel and thought it was a bargain for the quality of the hotel.

<Content>Very basic hotel Part of a hotel chain that offers basic accomodation to travelers. Efficient services, a rather convenient mini-store,  the use of coin-operated laundry room for longer stay. Should request for rooms above 9 floors, as lower-floor rooms are rather noisy. May improve on in-room amenities. No issue with internet speed.

<Content>Great stay My husband and I went to San Francisco to celebrate my birthday in August. Being the ultimate bargain hunter, I secured a reservation at the Courtyard Marriott Downtown on Priceline for $80/night for three nights($140/night on their website). The hotel was a bit further from the Union Square area than I had hoped originally, but that actually worked in our favor. The hotel was located in the financial district and very safe, we felt safe walking around the hotel and the adjoining areas at night and we actually didn't bump into any aggressive homeless persons as other travellers reported around the Union Square hotels. The valet parking was also slightly less expensive in that area ($40/day vs $45-$47) and if you had the energy to move your car in the morning at 7AM when the meters went into effect, there was plenty of free overnight street parking as well.The hotel staff were remarkably courteous and helpful. We asked for a room on a high floor with views of the city and were put in a room with a king bed on the 11th floor with a very nice city view. The room was quite large with a sitting area and work area (the hotel is mainly caters to business travellers). What I particularly enjoyed was the fitness room and pool/spa which were free of charge (other hotels charged their hotel guests a fee to use their fitness center!). Both were quite adequate too. There were also two computers in the hotel business center with free internet access and free printing which was convenient to print our airline boarding passes, although the connection was fairly slow.Overall, had a great stay there. Mariiott quality and hospitality were excellent.

<Content>Wonderful for a Courtyard I stayed here for two nights in August. We had a Flex Award, so our room and breakfast was covered, so I may have a more favorable opinion because we didn't pay very much.The lobby, bell staff and valets are very nice and helpful. They were always offering help and provided me with some very usful info on using mass transit.The lobby of the building is very nice, well decorated. There is a Starbucks in the lobby which has very limited hours on the weekend (closes very early). But there are several within walking distance that are open.Breakfast was very good, we had the buffet. I don't know if it's worth the money (ours was free), but it's as good or better than many Sheratons and Marriotts i've stayed at in the past. Good coffee and fresh omletts made to order.The room was very clean and resonably nice. We were on the 14th floor and it was very quiet. No street noise and no noise from other guests. We had a nice view of downtown.If I were spending the money on it, (usually close to $200 or more) I think I would pick a smaller boutique hotel. Especially a hotel that had cheaper parking, $40/day is outrageous but there aren't any other good options. You don't really need a car in San Francisco, the transit system is top notch. So if you can avoid driving, I would.

<Content>Nothing Special Location was decent, staff was helpful, and the lobby was nice. The rooms though were average and the bathroom was actually on the smaller side. My biggest complaint though is that the supposed high-speed internet connection was slower than molasses. Not just my room connection either, the business center was just as bad. Fairly annoying to say the least.

<Content>Terrific I stayed there mid-July and was very pleased with everything. Yes, the parking can be expensive, but worth it. They had the car there within 5 minutes the few times we needed it. Yet, it is only a few blocks from the BART station, and close to bus lines (which I highly recommend). It was a nice walk down to the Ferry Building for a casual dinner and an easy walk to MOMA. The room was very clean, with a nice view of the hills. Our maid was so accomodating and provided extra toiletries without asking. Food is so-so in the restaurants, but convienent. My 20 year old son met me in SF, so I appreciated the coin laundry....! The concierge and the front desk were very friendly and helpful. I definitely appreciated the fact that I made a reservation at a chain I had used before and it didn't let me down. If you want a clean, reliable hotel with a decent location, this is the one for you.

<Content>Courtyard Downtown - wonderful Spent 4 days at downtown Marriott Courtyard and it was very nice. While it is slightly off the beaten path (BART and bus stops about 3-4 blocks away) and further walk for cable cars, it is a VERY nice hotel. Room was a good size (although beds were rather firm), we had a nice view of the bay bridge, free breakfast in Jasmine's which was decent. Nice outside courtyard to sit in patio - wonderful fireplace inside hotel livingroom area.(which in SF it gets chilly). ALSO, they have 3 computers tucked near vending machines which guests can use for free to check email, etc... - nice surprise. Indoor pool VERY nice and water temp warm - girls loved it. They also have a Starbucks Coffee Shop inside Marriott - which I did not use - but certainly many guests did. FYI there are not too many restaurants in the closeby area - many close at dinner time. Liquor store across the street from Marriott - great if you want to get a bottle of wine - cheaper than drinking at the bar in the hotel. We used public transportation so we would walk every morning to bus stop - so did not have to pay high price for parking. Recommend MUNI passport for 3 days. Adult $15 - child $10 which is good on all public transportation (bus, cable cars, and electric trolley - NOT ferry or BART) and a GREAT deal.

<Content>Overpriced parking. Typical courtyard. Great business-traveler location. Expensive parking ($35)!!! No complimentary breakfast, which was disappointing. The staff was okay although the weekend we went, it was busy and they seemed pre-occupied. Not what we expect from the Marriott. The rooms were nothing special. Might stay there again.

<Content>Great Staff My husband and I just returned from a great weekend in San Francisco. Since we live only a couple of hours away we are able to go often. We decided years ago to never stay in the same hotel in San Francisco...even if it was a very good one. There are sooo many wonderful hotels there. We enjoy experiencing them all. So this was our first visit to the Courtyard Marriott. Every staff person we encountered were absolutly wonderful, professional and friendly. It made walking in the door after 5 hours of walking in Chinatown seem like coming home. The location is not bad, though, not right on the cable car line, it is close enough. Be sure and visit the hotels partner restaurant, the Fly-Trap. It is just around the corner. Nice place for a martini and their 3 oysters on the half shell starter while enjoying very smooth live jazz. The room was extremely clean! Spotless! Not fancy at all...just what you needed. The sink area outside the bathroom was very small. Not a bad size room for the Union Square area. Really enjoyed the outside courtyard in the lobby area. Never a problem getting an elevator. Service was extremely fast in all areas. Inside the hotel itself was very quiet. I like the fact that the window opend a bit..not much but just enough to feel the outside air. We live in the mountains and enjoy the noise of the city which is so different than home. We did not find the street noise bad at all. Only two things that I was disapointed with...The pool area was sans decor. Looked like it was planned to be hosed out 5 times a day. Very stark and cold feeling. With a few people there it got very loud. The best times to go to any hotel pool seems to be early in the morning and later at night. As someone had mentioned before, the pool water was not warm but after getting in, it was refreshing. It was very nice not to have to pay more to use the exercise area. Actually we were happy to have the pool and spa, not many hotels have a pool in this area. I think only 5 or 6. Again very clean.The one place I would have to give the hotel a black mark would be with the food. We ate breakfast in the Jasime room. Again the staff were lovely...but the food was not excepional. The menu was dull. The second day we ordered breakfast in our room. The fruit plate was dried out and looked very nasty. The Warwick Regis has an amazing fruit plate! Now, that hotel has the best chef! San Francisco has so many fantastic places to eat who would want to eat room service in your room? We do on occasion and this is not the place to order it! For dinner, hop in a cab and take a 5 minute ride to John's Grill for the Oysters Wellington. Ohsogood! I recomended this hotel as high as I did mostly because of the staff and the cleanness. And if we ever finish all the hotels in the area I will go back to the Courtyard looking forward to a nice stay and a new hotel chef for them to hire.

<Content>Good value. Nice, clean rooms, quiet. I got a good AAA rate. Nice Courtyard for an urban location. I was on a high floor but just a basic city view. I think few rooms have great views of the bridges etc. But my room was very bright, clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is pretty desolate on the weekend because it is near the business district. As a female solo traveler, I took cabs back to the hotel at night or friends dropped me off. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk up a slight hill from the Montgomery Bart station which I took from SFO airport. Good Deal! I rented a car nearby for my trip to wine country at the same rate as the airport rate. Parking is expensive so if you can try to rent a car in the city when you need it or park somewhere else. Otherwise you can get around with public transport. One thing, as a Marriott Rewards Silver guest I would expect some voucher toward my breakfast. Breakfast was not a bargain. Hilton Honors Gold gives vouchers or has free breakfast at some properties. I had a food stash from the Hampton Inn- Airport I stayed at the previous night ! A Starbucks is opening in the lobby. Not much in the immediate area for eating. Not real close to the major tourist attractions but the price was good! The hotel does provide free coffee and a free internet computer station.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel was great. It was in a really convenient location for us - about 10 minutes from Union Square (and all the shops) and 10 minutes from Chinatown. The rooms were bigger than expected, and very clean and tidy. The staff were friendly and very helpful, especially when we had asked to park outside the hotel briefly to collect our luggage from the luggage store (normally, if you want to park at the hotel, it's valet parking only and costs about $30 per day).

<Content>Horrible Parking! My fiance took me to San Francisco for my birthday and we stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Downtown in San Francisco. When we pulled up, they had no parking unless you wanted to pay a rediculous amount for vallet which was about the price for the entire hotel stay. So we found a meter outside and we had to wake up at 6:45 am to put money in the meter. It would only take money for 1 hour so we had to keep going back all morning and the front desk said we had to move our vehicle, not keep feeding the meter. Unfriendly staff and horrible parking! Do not recommend this property!

<Content>Comfortable stay in San Francisco My family and I stayed at the Courtyard San Francisco Downtown between 3/19/05 and 3/23/05 so I could attend a conference at the Moscone Center. After considering many hotels, we selected the Courtyard Downtown and were very pleased. Pros: Within walking distance of the Moscone Center (~ 3 long blocks), Metreon and Yerba Gardens (~ 4 long blocks), several restaurants, and public transit (1 to 4 blocks depending on where you want to go). If you don't mind walking a bit further (~ 6-9 blocks), you can hit some decent shopping. I found the hotel to be in an area with less of a homeless problem than hotels closer to the Moscone Center and Union Square. The hotel is fairly new---only a couple of years old. The rooms were clean, quiet, and had excellent beds. Two conveniences we appreciated were the guest laundry (one each on the 15th and 17th floors) with free soap and reasonable charges for washer/dryer ($1/load) and a business center off of the lobby with two computers for guest use and an ATM machine. The lobby was attractive with a fireplace and a pleasant adjacent bar area for drinks in the early evening. We ate breakfast at the hotel and had room service for a late dinner one night and were pleased with the food. Parking is expensive ($35) as is the case at many hotels in San Fran. There is only valet parking on site, but there is a self-serve parking lot on Second Street at Howard (~ a block and one-half from the hotel) that is under $20. In spite of the cost, we did use the valet parking for its convenience and I can tell you that all experiences we had with the different valet parking employees were positive; I don't think we had to wait more than 3 to 5 minutes for our vehicle at any time. In fact, we were very pleased with the service and helpfulness of all employees we encountered at the hotel.Cons: Although the pool is inside, my husband and daughter found the water to be on the cold side. The only other thing I thought would have been nice would be to have had a small refrigerator in the room.All in all, we were very pleased with our experience and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Highly recommended Just back from 4 nights at the Courtyard Downtown = excellent, newish hotel = large nicely furnished room, big bathroom = good service at the front desk and in the bar . Only downside , the area is a bit dead at night and at the weekend as it is situated in the financial district and public transport is a 5 to 10 min walk to Market St but taxis always available outside.Rack rate 199$ but if you shop around you can find this hotel for 100$ including tax.I can highly recommend this hotel

<Content>What a great hotel! My wife and I traveled on 02/16 for 4 nights to this hotel. We had a great time. The staff was very friendly and courteous as well as very helpfull. We requested a room on the high floor and we got it. We had a great city view of the financial district and the Transamerica tower. The room service, like any other hotel, was expensive but delicious. The lobby was beautiful. We never got a chance to try the pool or fitness center. The hotel is just 3 blocks away from public transportation pickups. (Bart, Muni, and Cable car) I would definitely reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for a very clean, neat, cozy, and inexpensive hotel. We will definitely be going back.
