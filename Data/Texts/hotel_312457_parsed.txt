<Content>A mixed bag! Been to Bali heaps of times but never stayed at Seminyak. Stayed at Pelangi with my husband and adult daughter in August.Lobby and what little grounds there are very lovely - pool area a bit small - didn't like the tiered deck chair area. Didn't like the fact that everyone walking past the restaurant to the beach passed the pool at chest level - felt a bit odd. Even though we had a superior room - do not try to put 3 people in one - far too small. Unfortunately they did not have any other rooms available. There are two wings to the hotel and the balconies face each other across a central (not very wide) courtyard. So no chance of any privacy on your balcony - you can hear every conversation going!! The balcony was only bit enough for one chair - the ones on the ground floor were just a small landing with some steps.The staff were great and helpful and very attentive but the rooms are just a bit too small to warrant a return visit, sorry Pelangi. Also found with the increased taxi drivers in Kuta/Legian area not being local (ie from Denpasar) - they didn't know where the hotel was which made things tricky late at night!!

<Content>Great hotel for the price that you pay. Hospitable and lovely staff. This was our 2nd stay at the Pelangi hotel. We needed a place that would have many rooms available for our friends traveling to our wedding in Bali (at a different location). The staff at the sales office were so helpful and offered competitive group rates. We all had an excellent stay there. Everyone on staff was extremely hospitable, friendly, and nice. They were interested in getting to know all our guests to ensure that they had a nice stay. The spa at the hotel was also quite amazing. For really good rates, one can get many wonderful treatments, such as massages or facials. Pelangi Hotel is very affordable and for the price that you pay you certainly can't beat the beachfront location, the close proximity to restaurants/bars in the area, the wonderful staff, the breakfast buffet, and the excellent spa. Thank you, Pelangi!

<Content>Nice place I think it is a nice place. It is close to Kuta/Legian but not as busy. It has all the shops but is a little bit less comercialised than Kuta/Legian. Hotel is on the beach which makes such a difference. We liked the way it is located right on the beach. What's more for your sunbed you can observe local hookers. There are nice beach 'restaurants' just few steps from the hotel. Further down there are few more proper places to eat (There is a sushi place - really good sushi, honestly. Worth trting, I was really surprised - RAINBOW ROLL was just FANTASTIC :) )The hotel itself was really nice. It has this nice local look and feel. Rooms are nice and clean. Cant complain about anything. The only issue that we had was lack of privacy. The hotel has two building just in front of each other. You can't simply go and sit on balcony without seeing people accross. The ground floor is even worse. It is not a big deal but i found it irritating that i could not open the curtains because of people on the otehr side.

<Content>Early check-out My wife and I were booked in to the Pelangi for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. We did as was suggested to us and sprung for the more expensive rooms. We shouldn't have wasted our money. While the room was large it was at the end of what must be one of the longest hallways in existence. The pool area is rundown and dirty and was the biggest let down of the hotel. The beach area is also filthy.We decided to move to another hotel after the first night.Whilst all hospitality staff in Bali are excellent, the front desk staff were not helpful or friendly especially when we checked out early, and wouldn't help us arrange transport to another hotel.There are a lot of better places to stay in Bali for a similar price.

<Content>Quite and pleasant Stayed for six days in early July coming from NZ's Winter. This is a clean and very tidy 4 star hotel in a relatively quite Legian/Seminyak location not to far from AJ Hackets. (Can't be heard though at night). The entrance is on a short cul de sac with no walk out restaurants, however at night step out onto the beach and walk 100m south toward Legian and you are into food heaven back up on the beach's linking road. Note the Pelangi is direct beach with no road in between and that's a bonus. Try Lanai's upstairs for class and great price. The Hotel pool and restaurant are on the beach so another bonus, and morning buffet breakfast is a smorgasbord of choice and eating out on the tiled exterior in the balmy Bali morning air. I booked directly with the hotel and avoided the touts. Our Super Delux room room was sizeable and included an extra bedroom space for a young one traveling with us. There is a hint of a new development occuring on the Northern side so check with the desk to see its progress. If its underway book the Southern block. At the moment it is just a hole in the ground but things move fast in Asia! The property is a long narrow double blocks (2 story) complex so try to get as close to the pool and beach (Rooms 300 plus). Touts on the beach are intense as anywhere in Bali. No problem. The pool is magnificent and quite a bonus. Surf infront is closeout material all the time and you need to walk 100 meters either way to get a rideable shoulder. Overall neat stay and would come back for the location and solitude.Again nice place. Enjoy.

<Content>Happy until our room was robbed I spent 7 nights at the Pelangi on honeymoon, and was having a great time there until one night our room was robbed while we were out. As we left our room I forgot to take my purse with me, which contained my credit card, safety deposit box key and the equivalent of 拢100 cash. This is the one and only time I have EVER left my purse behind,and was a complete and utter mistake. We were out of the room between 1630 and 2200, and during that time someone entered our room and took the money from my purse, leaving behind everything else. I only noticed the next morning when we were going out to get the money changed into rupiahs. Some laundry had been collected from our room during these hours. After searcing the room 3 times over (just in case), we alerted the manager straight away, who was very apologetic, and told us he would investigate. He later informed us that all staff had been searched and nothing had been found, but if the money was taken the night before when we were out then it would be long gone. To be fair, the manager did his best to help, he took us to the police station helped translate and fill in a police report. But we never saw our money again. It really put a massive downer on our honeymoon, and I spent the rest of the stay in tears. Although the manager insisted it had never happened before, the first thing reception tell you is to keep all valuables in the safety deposit boxes as they won't be responsible for anything going missing. It's also a bit suspicious that the one and only time we leave money in the room is the time it gets stolen. If this hadn't happened, I would have given this hotel a good review, as we were enjoying our stay until this happened. Rooms are decent and clean, although the bathroom could do with a good clean in places. Pool area is nice, views from the restaurant are lovley and the location is good. It's just a shame it was ruined by thieves. If you do decide to stay here, keep everything in the safety box at reception, and don't make the mistake of forgetting your purse or wallet when you go out.

<Content>Great Hotel for a great price Our time spent at the pelangi bali hotel was so good that we stayed for an extra 3 days. The free breakfast was simple but pretty good and rotated throughout the week. The view from the restaurant was excellent, and I really enjoyed waking up to a cup of coffee while watching the surfers catch the 4-5 ft. waves directly in front of the hotel. The rooms were very large for the price and had a full suite of amenities. The bathroom was a little rusty but still quite adequate. The hotel staff was extremely friendly, and helped out with any possible request. The only real problem I had with the hotel was the booking. I booked through their website, gave them my credit card info, and received a confirmation...then on my day of travel they abruptly canceled my reservation. I didn't find out until I was at the hotel. The hotel was very accommodating though, and gave me a room for around the same price as the internet special I wanted (~550000 Rp) despite not having a reservation when I showed up.

<Content>simply the best the rooms although small are good and cleaned daily.the pool cannot be faulted and the attendants are friendly. beach hawkers not a hassel as have stayed there many times and got to know them just a polite no then they leave you alone the most amazing massages by ruti on the beach. however be warned one of the porters is looking to finance a pig farm and gets to know you and then reels in for the money ask, this i found a little affronting and did not like. breakfasts were good as you could eat as much as you liked and my husband had his fill most mornings. room upgrade for us was a god send as we both could have our space and sit on the balcony to have our evening drinks. nice and quiet and relaxing way to spend a holiday in bali will definately make it a base always. oh and when we had a problem the management sorted this out with us straight away and even offered us a complementary dinner for our trouble (which we declined) returning in 2008 cant wait.

<Content>Hated this Hotel My partner and I hated this hotel so much we only stayed one night instead of the 10 we'd booked. I'd booked a deluxe room and it was anything but. The room was extremely dark and you needed lights on during the day. We also found the room none-too-clean and the sheets were stained. The outside sitting area was tiny and there was absolutely no privacy whatever. The bathroom was also very dark with a lethal slippery floor. The inside sitting area, which makes the room deluxe would have been like sitting in a container; it was horrible. We found the general attitude of the staff to be unfriendly. This hotel has a restrictive cancellation policy and we had to pay for an extra night for leaving early but it was worth it to get out of there. Their on-line rates were $80 US; I later found a site quoting $66 US and they did honour that rate (although they then refused to do an airport pick-up) but in all honestly that is still way too much to pay for this third-rate properly.

<Content>Pelangi rocks!!!! Anyone who's has any worries about staying at the pelangi, dont be worried at all. The staff were really friendly and being a small hotel we got to befriend quite alot of them. Rooms were clean and tidied everyday if you wish them to be, fresh water in rooms everyday. pool is beautiful and loved the pool bar also loved the fact that the pool overlooked the beach which was great for the sunsets. Locals on the beach are really nice( after you get through all the you buy you buy). Cant think of a nicer place to stay that was within our budget. totally impressed!!! :)

<Content>Great Value! My wife and I, as well as two of our friends just returned from a two week trip to Bali. We found the Pelangi on line and checked out reviews on trip advisor. Our agent had never put together a package with this hotel before, preferring to place people in the quieter Nusa Dua or Benoa areas. We were encouraged by the predominantly positive reviews and booked for the two weeks, at what we thought was a very good rate. It was as good as we had hoped! The place is very clean, the staff very friendly and attentive. Our room was on the second floor and as nice as you would expect a  3 star  hotel to be. The air conditioning worked perfectly [ a must at these temperatures!] , and the room was cleaned daily and the towels and bedding changed daily if you wished. You can just have the bed remade and hang the towels to help reduce water consumption etc. an option that we chose immediately. There was a nice clean pool, plenty of towels, and loungers. Breakfasts were included and while not fantastic, there were lots to choose from and plenty of it. [ Sweet girls at the  egg station  ].The beach frontage is a bit busy with  hawkers  but they are not allowed past the front wall to the grounds. The surf is rather big and so it isn`t great for swimming here, so the pool is welcome. Seminyak is not as busy as Kuta but it is still too busy for many, so we chose to take a couple of 2 day trips to other areas. [ Got to see the real Bali that way! ]. There are plenty of restaurants to check out up the road behind the hotel as well as Gado Gado down the beach about 100 metres. [ excellent food and ambiance, especially at night. ] Lucky Day and Gateway to India were both good, as well as reasonably priced. [Even the warungs on the beach were ok] .We enjoyed our stay at the Pelangi, and would recommend it for those not expecting a 4 or 5 star experience. It was a great location and a bargain for the price!

<Content>Bad, bad, bad My husband and I go to Bali yearly and have always stayed around the Kuta/Legian area so for a change we picked Seminyak this time. I picked the Pelangi based on the great reviews so I was really shocked when we got to our rooms after a night flight in from Singapore.The long and dark corridor we were led down to our rooms resembled a jail with high-walls on one side. When our porter opened the door to our room, it smelled like mildew and when the air-con was turned on, the musty smell intensified. Who needs a large room when it smelled this bad. When I peeked into the bathroom, it made me really curl my toes as I walked in and saw mould in the corners. The ventilation fan made a funny noise and the towels were no longer white and was spotted with stains! The bad experience continued the next morning. Construction nearby started banging away so we got up and went to breakfast. Even the great location and proximity to the beach did not help. Breakfast was nothing spectacular and in any case, you'll be too busy swatting flies. The pool which looked so good in pictures is really small and narrow with constantly had well-oiled folks contributing to the layer of grease on the surface. I sure did not want to get into that water.We got the hell out of Pelangi and headed to another hotel to salvage our holiday. Mind you, I'm not a prissy traveller. I have no qualms about roughing it out and have paid USD18 a night for simpler accomodations in Bali that's more pleasant than here. What pisses me off is that I paid USD68 a night and it just ain't worth it.

<Content>Good value hotel Just back from 3 nights at the Pelangi. Got a good deal on a Superior double with breakfast. Met at the airport by friendly driver, smooth easy check in,welcome drink, cold refreshing towels, friendly smiley service in general.Rooms are OK, good size, comfortable beds, everything worked.Bathroom could have been a little nicer. eventho was clean..a little mould here and there, gave it a very slight grotty feeling. But hey, for the price and for the amount of time that you ACTUALLY are going to be in your hotel room in Bali, it's fine. I think it could be a really great hotel if they spent a little more time and effort upkeeping it. The grounds and gardens are generally nice enough.Breakfast was disappointing, presentation and variety were sadly lacking. Staff a little lackadaisical tho polite. Nice view of the surf tho. Pool looks almost as good as in the photos on the website. Had a lovely evening swim under the stars which was great.If you want a 5 star luxurious stay, this aint it. There are heaps of villas for rent that will do the trick but the pelangi is good value for money,comfortable and is pretty well situated. Getting a flight into Bali was difficult, with most of them sold out. our flight was packed...but once out and about in seminyak - it felt a little dead...heaps of great restaurants, shops and bars but all empty.

<Content>Better than most !! Just back from our 11th trip to Bali but our first time at the Pelangi,and I must say I'm a little surprised by the recent negative reviews.Having stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels on the island the Pelangi has a lot going for it.We were in a super deluxe($64 through an internet site) and the room was very good,huge bathroom,seperate lounge,good size balcony and a large 6' bed.Proably not enough storage space for some but overall pretty good.Minor problem with the airconditioning was sorted out within the hour and the maintenance guys couldn't have been more helpfull.Plenty of sunbeds were available despite some of the koreans or taiwanese thinking they should save 3 or 4 sunbeds just in case they fancied lying somewhere else later in the day.The beach location was fantastic and as for there being a lot of noise from the Bungy tower well we never heard it once and we were in the hotel at the same time as the reviewer who complained about it.Loads of places to eat both on Jl Laksamana (a 5 minute $1 cab ride away) and on Jl Dhyanapura itself.The hotel is only 15 minutes walk down the beach to Ku De Ta and is only 5 minutes from Gado Gado.Maybe if you want burger and chips then this place is not for you but if you like good food you're in the right location.As for the shopping,there are loads of individual clothes shops mainly for women on Jl Raya Seminyak and some of the funkiest furniture and lighting shops are in this part of Bali.All in all this hotel is very good value in a great location and is a lot better than many on the island and is a world away from some of the overpriced rubbish we have to put up with in Europe.

<Content>Not all that impressive Myself and 4 of my girl friends have just arrived home after having stayed at the Pelangi for a week. In all honesty, we weren't all that impressed with the place. Two of our group were in a twin share room upstairs from us but had to be moved after a couple of days coz the stench in their room was so bad and then the new room started to smell after a day of being in there too. The beds were far too firm for my liking, I think the pool lounges would have been more comfortable. The staff were very friendly and the daily breakfasts were nice. The hotel restaurant has a good selection on their menu and everything that we had was nice and not too expensive either. The hotel is quite large. so if your after a smaller more intimate place to stay, then the Pelangi is not for you. There are plenty of places to eat just down the road on Dhyana Pura but if it's shopping you're after, then you'll have to cab it everyday back to Legian or Kuta coz there really aren't too many bargains to be had around Seminyak. If u need a cab, go around the corner to Dhyana Pura and up a bit on the left hand side and you'll find some blue taxi's parked waiting and they have meters in them, so you'll get a better fare. All in all, this was an 'okay' hotel but I probably wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Good choice for the Seminyak area Pelangi is definite value for money. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff are very friendly and cheerful. The pool area is nice and bigger than a lot of pictures give it credit and there was always enough loungers to go round. Location wise it is right on the beach, and a good stretch of beach at that. That is it's real attraction for us. The beach at Kuta is nowhere near as nice. It's also a short walk along the beach to nice restaurants like Ku De Ta and plenty of others if you walk up the street into town. Breakfast was decent enough as well.I know a lot of people are annoyed by them, but some of the hawkers near this place on the beach actually made our stay very enjoyable. Some can be annoying, but a firm no and they get the message. However, 3 really do stand out as very, very nice people. There is Dewa (pronounced Day wa) who is directly in front of the entrance to the beach (if a little to the left) and he sells much cheaper Bintang than the hotel. A real nice man if you want a chat as well and we used to watch the sunset while having a few of his beers. There is Sui Me who is a little more to the left and does a great massage for a very good price. Finally, there is a lad called Ben who rents out boogie boards and surf boards. He gives a 2 hour surf lesson as well, way cheaper than the big companies and I was actually surfing after that.Overall, a great stay, without breaking the bank.

<Content>Great Location Staye here for 6 days paid $60 a night for a superior room. I would not pay any more than this. it was clean and comfortable, but needed airing it had a bit of a musty smell with it. The room was not very bright inside as all the rooms look onto each other.The pool area is very squashed with sun bed which could do with replacing. More maintance in this area is needed.The pool itself is nice.The staff are very pleasant. The lobby area is very clean.Very close to Ku De Ta. The best place to eat was the Warrison although you have too book . we had some great meals in Bali. We never ate at the hotel.We were hardly ever at the hotel since we were at wedding celebrations most days. So the pool area never bothered us. This would not be my choice of place to spend a week at, but saying that others are very happy with the standard of the accomodation as they have weddings at the hotel.Visited the Istana Villa in Uluwatu this was amazing. Also spent time at the Conrad hotel in Nusadua which is very nice and you could get a double room for 拢70 inc. breakfast. Which I thought was good value.Yes I would tell people about this hotel because of its location but I would check out the Resor first as they have some good deals including airport transfer if you contact them directly.If changing currency in Bali take largerdenominations you get a better rate of exchange.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Prices On our first trip to Bali we stayed at two hotels, one in Sanur and this one in Seminyak. This was by far the better hotel and was significantly cheaper.We got the superior rooms but that wasn't really necessary. Its good if you have a group and want to congregate in the sitting rooms to plan your days, otherwise the regular rooms are just fine.The pool was great and there are lots of places to sit around it that are far enough away to avoid the beach hawkers becoming a nuisance.The staff here were very friendly and I found myself at ease here and felt really safe and secure. Its close to all the amenities but far enough away to just relax as well.

<Content>Great find! Booked the Pelangi with hotelsbali.com and got a great rate of USD$46 plus tax inclusive of breakfast for 2. Room on the ground floor facing garden. We could not fault the place considering the price we paid. The pool was great, breakfast on the beachfront, lovely Balinese people and smiles, nice walks along the beach and up on the street to explore. We went to the famed Kudeta one night for dinner and walked home on the beach lighted by moonlight. Very nice. We also rented a car from one of the many car rental places along the street. It was offpeak so we took the cheapest car - Suzuki Katana 1000cc! which we were offered for 100,000 rp but we bargained to 70,000 per day for 2 days rental. It was good for exploring the area, Uluwatu and Sanur. We later traded it for a better car to take us around to Ubud which we know better. Some warning: money changers. Those with amazing rates seem to have a system to make sure you leave with less money as they would definitely make a loss. We tried 4 or 5 and they all played the same game, usually with some friend next to them to distract you. In the end, we just withdrew from the many ATMs everywhere.This is our second trip to Bali, first time on Seminyak.

<Content>"Loved the Pool" We stayed at the Pelangi from 25/2-6/3. Would love to have stayed longer. Value for money is what this hotel is. We paid roughly $50 (aussie) for a deluxe room for 9 nights. Im sure the superior rm would have been fine although we hear otherwise. As stated in other reviews the hotel is in a great location. Not far to walk to night clubs or the beautiful Gado Gado restaraunt. Also a ten minute walk along the beach to the stunning Ku DeTa. This place is like being in another world at night. The hotel staff at the Pelangi were lovely. We had a lot of laughs with Dennix  Asra, we learn a lot about the Balinese (Hindu) culture. People on the beach can become a little annoying when you are trying to relax by the pool  they kepp yelling out you want massage, etc etc. You do get used to this. The only main downsides to this hotel are the buffet breakfast, the food wasnt that great  not much variety. Also the pool bar isnt always staffed and on a number of occassions we had to get up to order lunch drinks. Overall for what we paid we cannot complain

<Content>Great Value, and excellent location This hotel is really good value. We are a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids under 11) so we booked two adjoining standard rooms. The rooms were big, nice aircon and bathrooms, and good Satellite TV. The pool was excellent. The buffet breakfast that was included was good, and changed daily. The best thing was the price. I can't remember what currency I paid in now but I think it was $US and it worked out as only 拢48 for the two rooms inc breakfast per night. Another terrific advantage is its location. It's only 50 metres along the beach to Gado Gado, which is one of the best restaurAnts around. Only 15 mintes walk along the beach to Ku De Ta, which is one of my favourite restaurant/ bar/ clubs in the world. 20,000 rupiah would get a taxi into Kuta when we wanted to buy cheap DVDs and kids clothes. A 15 minute walk into Seminyak and we could buy stuff from the more upmarket shops. Oh and did I mention the hotel is right on the beach.

<Content>Great location Pelangi Bali hotel is in a great location - right on Seminyak Beach. It is only a 10-15 minute walk along the beach to the great restaurants on Seminyak beach. Great location to go for a beach swim and get a beautiful massage on the beach. The sun lounges ar ein prime position to enjoy the beach but without being hassled.The rooms are very large with a good comfy bed. The bathroom was small, the shower head was great but it wasn't spotless. We had a ground floor room but some of the first story rooms had a balcony - perfect for a drink.The downsides for this hotel was the pool was in the shade most of the day, the pool bar was never staffed and the breakfast was OK. The pool service and drinks wasn't great by Bali standards with beers 3x the normal Bali price.Overall though it was great value for money and good for us as we don't laze at the hotel too much.

<Content>Love the Pelangi Hotel We just spent 12 days at the Pelangi and loved it. Best deal in Bali. Great loction and very friendly, accomdating staff. The restaurant was below par, but you are only a 1$ cab ride from restaruant row in Seminyak. If you like being in the middle of it all then this is the place. It is right on the beach, but only 2 rooms actually face the beach. The pool is on the beach which is were we hung out. Enjoy.

<Content>fab hotel  I felt that I had to write a review after reading someone say the management were rude at the Pelangi. I spent two weeks with a girlfriend and we absolutely loved the hotel. When we were ripped off by money changers in the main street- (beware ONLY go to authorised money dealers!!!!) we went to reception to tell them about our ordeal and they immediatley called the Manager. He then got the hotel car and drove us to the shark and proceeded to get the 100$ back that we had been ripped off. The staff were fanastic but please don't take up the offer from a staff member to go to Jimbaran for dinner as it was very expensive. We really could not fault the room, the view from the breakfast table and the sunsets. For anyone who is thinking of going to Bali go it is amazing and the friendliest people you will meet. I sure you will fall in love like we have with the place. Will be back next year Lou  Tracey ( well travelled girls)
