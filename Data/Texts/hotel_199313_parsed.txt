<Content>OK hotel Stayed at this hotel last weekend for 3 nights. The hotel was clean and the rooms pleasant. The staff were very helpful and friendly however the first room we were offered was noisy as the bed head actually backed on to the lift shaft, so we were offered another room which was better or so we thought. The walls were paper thin and we were awakened by our neighbours who came in late and went out early - much loud conversation and door slamming and showering at 5.30am. It actually felt as if we were in the bathroom, the noise was so loud. Definitely not to be recommended if you are a light sleeper! - or take some ear plugs!!The breakfasts were outrageously expensive 24 euros per person - OK if you are on an expense account with a European bank but if you are paying your own way rather pricey. We ate breakfast at a rather nice cafe down the road for less than 10 euros for 2 people. Dinner in the hotel was better value and the food very nice. Good to get home for a decent night's sleep!

<Content>Quality business hotel handy to transport links We needed somewhere handy to the station and airport so decided to splurge a bit for our last night and stay here. We had eaten in the restaurant a couple of times on previous trips to Frankfurt.The hotel did not dissappoint. The room we recieved was gorgeously refurbished, spotless and very stylish. The service level was great with the desk offering a good rate on a late check out which suited our return flight timing. Our car was ushered away and delivered back without delay. Taxis where available at the door. Dinner in the restaurant was good quality with attentive service.The location is close to the river and walking paths, about 3 minutes walk to the railway and 15 minutes by taxi to the airport. Whilst it is away from Rommer and the shopping strip they are only 5 minutes by the tram a block away.Only two blots which were of no particular consequence. Like all business hotels the breakfast, whilst generous was over priced. This is a complaint that could be applied to just about any 5 star hotel anywhere. Secondly we tried to unload some Amex travellers cheques to settle the bill and whilst the hotel would take them the surcharge was ridiculous. Now travellers cheques are a waste of space at the best of times and we have been progressively unloading these for about three years but the fee here was truly ridiculous.

<Content>A has been that never was I rated this based on the expectations that come with Le Meridien ... If you are expecting 4 or 5 stars, you will be quite disappointed. It is close to the main train station (a plus for convenience) and it is not really terrible considering all the other options.So why the rating?When I checked in, I found a terrible smoke smell, a left-over hair in the sink and a general sense that the room was long overdue for refurbishment. When i later discovered that the internet connection was not functional, I ended up moving to another room.The second room was smaller than the first, and had bad stains on the carpet. The bathroom was also somewhat cramped and the view was horrible. The bellman was extremely lazy. He was supposed to have brought me the key to the new room and helped me move, but after 30 minutes I gave up and went downstairs with all my luggage. At that point he was eager for a tip, of course.The restaurant was almost vacant and the service was still terribly slow. The food was OK, but overpriced. I had intended to stay there again a week later, but switched to the Westin Grand.

<Content>Wonderful hotel My wife and I were visiting Frankfurt for the first time and stayed at The Meridien Park Hotel. It was a wonderful stay and the hotel lived up to all the good reviews it has received. The hotel is ideally situated within walking distance of the main train station but in its own little square and away from traffic etc. Very safe to walk around at night. Our double room was very spacious and made a great first impression the minute we opened the door. Beautiful bathroom and great shower. The hotel was spotless with excellent staff, very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was by far the best we have had in any continental hotel. We would highly recommend this lovely hotel and will certainly return.Dunner Ireland

<Content>Super service and elegant luxury This is a hotel that is definitely first class in all dimensions: Service, rooms, breakfast etc. I stayed only one night (regrettably) and did not have the chance for dinner or using the other amenities, but the staff really took care about their guests and managed to arrange a more or less spontaneous meeting in the morning bringing croissants and various forms of coffee to my business guests 鈥?and this was done with a broad smile. I got upgraded to a mini-suite in the newly built wing and it was excellent. Good working desk, trouser press and a good view over the Frankfurt skyline. I will definitely come back to this hotel when in Frankfurt

The hotel location is great so close to the station where tourist buses leave. The bar has a very relaxing and inviting atmosphere with piano playing. Meals in the restaurants were pricey but the food was wonderful. The staff at the hotel are very helpful without being over friendly. From the time you walk into the hotel and into your room all is luxury with a peaceful and relaxing feeling.

<Content>Excellent hotel and service I have stayed at Le Meridien Parkhotel in Frankfurt several times while I was on business trips in southern Germany. Most recently in May this year. The service is excellent and my wife loved the exquisite breakfast buffet. The restaurant has a very impressive menu as well for dining. I have had the privilege to stay in both the older part of the hotel that is very beautiful and classical and the newer part on the 5th floor. This part has amazing interior design. I would greatly recommend this hotel to anyone requiring class and service.

<Content>Absolute Perfection I have just returned from a 3 day trip to Frankfurt and I stayed in the Meridien. From the moment I arrived at the entrance of the hotel I was pleased. The staff are fantastic and very helpful, professional in every way. The hotel is extremely clean - the best I have ever come across and the service is fantastic. I cannot reiterate how thrilled I was at this hotel. The breakfast provides for everyone with a selection of fresh fruit, yogurts, jams, cereals, pastries, breads and the chef will cook your food fresh to your liking e.g. eggs, omelettes etc. The rooms are very spacious with a modern design, bright, airy and very clean. Our room contained two flat screen TV's - one in the bedroom and one in the living room. And most importantly they are sound proof so no need to worry about noise from the street - a problem I have had in the past. I would definitely hope to return to this hotel in the future and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>My favorite Hotel in Frankfurt Hotel Le Merdien Parkhotel in Frankfurt, Germany is an excellent choice because of its convenient location, comfortable accommodations and friendly staff. It is situated in a quiet area across a small park and only a two minutes walk from Central Train Station. You will find yourself only two blocks away from the river Maine, where folks like to go jogging, biking or simply to enjoy the view. From the airport it is only a twelve minute ride by train that costs E3.60 or by taxi which costs approximately E25.00 and takes from twenty to twenty five minutes. Furthermore, you can take a twenty minutes stroll from the hotel to the Romer (downtown area). This is why I recommend Le Meridien Parkhotel for its location.The rooms are very clean with a very charming modern d茅cor. There are a lot of amenities including a business center and the complimentary use of a gym with sauna and steam bath. You will never forget the friendly and dedicated staff that is ready to help and to make every effort so that your stay is most enjoyable.In the summer, the hotel serves drinks and a light dinner at the Garden Caf茅 in the park, under the trees. Smokers are welcomed here, and that is a big advantage since smoking is prohibited in restaurants

The staff was extremely friendly and I had a bright and spacious room overloking the Frankfurt Skyline. Huge advantage of this place is the location. A taxi brought me from the airport within 15 min. The next morning I walked in 5 minutes to our European Regional Office. I didn't use the restaurant for dinner but the breakfast buffet was huge. I love to go back.

<Content>Enjoyeble stay in Frankfurt This is a fantastic hotel, real 5 star luxury. My partner and I stayed here in March 2008 on a 2 day city break. The hotel is in a great location for the city centre and only one minute walk from Central Station. The unusual building is interesting and very well renovated. They have a historical and a modern wing. Our room was in the modern wing on the 3rd floor overlooking the park and despite a road outside it was very quite. The rooms are lovely with beds to die for, large and comfortable. We tried the restaurant one night and the food was excellent and the cook in the open kitchen was a true entertainer. The one thing that made this hotel so great was the friendliness of the staff. Nothing was too much trouble. This is what a 5 star hotel should be like and would be my choice again.Would I recommend this hotel to my best friend?absolutely! I recommend this hotel for:Business people, A romantic getaway, Girlfriend getaway, Tourists. I do not recommend this hotel for:People with disabilities, Families with young children, Families with teenagers.I selected this hotel as a top choice for:Museums / Cultural / Historical sites, business locations.

<Content>Business hotel The hotel is well situated, but without any character at all. The staff are pleasant enough and helpful, breakfast was good and very expensive, but as we went during one of the big exhibitions that would probably be true of any other hotel as well. Our room was compact and renovated with a small area to have meetings. The couple we went with were not quite so lucky and had to settle for a dated twin room on the 8th floor. The bathroom was small with a shower spraying all over the place. It all felt like a glorified travel-lodge. There must be better hotels (I hope).

<Content>Always return here when in Frankfurt for business I am in Frankfurt for work about 6 times a year and whenever I can I stay at the meridien. The rooms are modern, sleek and thoughtfully set out (e.g. with unintrusive nightlight automatically on so you do not kill yourself trying to get up at night in an unfamiliar environment), with extremely comfortable beds, large well-appointed bathrooms and nice toiletries. They also always provide good quality slippers and gowns and there a is a nice quiet spa that is open until 10 pm.Staff are very efficient and check-in and check-out very easy and quick. The only minus is the Parc restaurant, where smoking is allowed, service is terrible (long waits, wrong food served with no grace) and the food overcomplicated and fatty. Breakfast is not bad, but for dinner go somewhere else.

<Content>Splendid service and food, incredibly narrow rooms I've stayed multiple times at Le Meridien Park, mainly on business. The hotel is clean, friendly and offers good quality food in the restaurant. But their really big problem is their rooms: They are extra small! What they promote as superior rooms are very narrow with the smallest possible double bed and partly renovated. The standard rooms are either the same as the superior but not renovated or much smaller (the room size cannot be more than 6squ.meters), with a single twin bed, no night tables (the phone is over the bed), a 50cm corridor space along the bed and an extra small bathroom with only shower which is extremely small (a tall or a bit fat person cannot wash in there). I wonder how a hotel of this class is allowed to call these standard rooms. It should be made clear at least on their site that the so-called standard is not even 3-star level. Location is Ok, by the central railway station, though this is not the best neighborhood of Frankfurt - close to red light area, and it is around 3km away from the main shopping area of Zeil. The financial district is around 1km away. The trade fare is relatively close, 2 tram stops away.

<Content>no frills in Frankfurt I stayed here for a business meeting with my team last month because it was close to our Frankfurt office. To be honest, I have no idea if this place is anywhere near the city centre, so I can't say much about the location. It was just that we paid quite a few Euros for the rooms here and I was expecting something super chic and fancy. The rooms were quite small and nothing out of the ordinary. But maybe that was because of a full occupancy at the hotel.I have to say that the staff everywhere at the hotel was super friendly and very helpful.Another thing I didn't like was that the breakfast buffet was in the middle of the lobby and you were kind of left standing with your croissant and coffee with no hands left to read a paper.Great paprika chips in the hotel bar though!! I can't ever seem to find them here in the UK.

<Content>Fine Hotel, Dubious City I used the Meridien mostly as a base for regional travel. It is only a block from the Hauptbahnhof (main train station), on a surprisingly quiet tree-lined square. Save money and probably time too by taking the S-Bahn (suburban rail) from the airport, a 10 minute ride. The hotel is safely on the other side of the station from the sex clubs and purveyors of Germany鈥檚 national food, the doner kebap. It鈥檚 only a few blocks from the serene bank of the Main River, which you can easily cross on foot to get to Frankfurt鈥檚 world-class Stadel Art Institute.My room was smartly designed in a sleek, contemporary, but not cold style. It was typically compact but fine for one. I don鈥檛 quite get why they insist on putting king beds in small spaces like this. I mean, nobody would spend their honeymoon here, would they? A full bed would leave some room to move about. There was a plasma TV (unfortunately no HD content). They left a complimentary bottle of mineral water every day. The marble bathroom with unique frosted glass door was fine but had the ubiquitous flood-prone half-shower door. The Meridien鈥檚 lobby is small and low-key. There is a cozy but overpriced bar. You might prefer the great Irish pub a block away. The hotel鈥檚 facade occupies a nice old townhouse connected to a larger, hideously ugly modern wing. Fitting, as most of Frankfurt is modern and hideously ugly. Frankfurt is close to some nice places, such as Heidelberg, Cologne and the great Imperial Free Cities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz (the last, 陆 hour by S-Bahn). Unfortunately, Frankfurt itself is not one of those nice places. It has all the charm of Paramus, NJ. The Meridien would be a good choice for business. There is high speed in room internet, and the hotel is within a long walk or short U-Bahn (subway) ride of all the big banks and the Messe (fairgrounds).One thing about Meridiens: don鈥檛 assume that discount reservation will get you the best deal. Their own website is often cheaper, and freely cancellable too.I wouldn鈥檛 voluntarily travel to Frankfurt again. If I needed to be there for business I鈥檇 probably try to negotiate a compromise venue like wonderful Munich. Failing that, I would certainly stay at the Meridien.

<Content>Exceeded my expectations I chose this hotel because of its proximity to the train station. Because the picture showed an older building, I thought it might be old fashioned, but in fact there is a modern wing and the rooms have a very clean, comfortable modern decor and amenities. The entire hotel was very clean. The breakfast which was included in the rate was absolutely perfect. This is a great choice for a traveler who is transiting through Frankfurt. It would also be a good alternative to an impersonal airport hotel because the train to the airport is convenient or you can get a cab for about 23 euros.

<Content>Frankly bad in Frankfurt This is a lovely hotel but has some severe problems. With any luck they are temporary but it was definitely NOT worth the inflated rate I was paying. Save yourself a big headache and contact them before making a reservation to find out if they are finished with their renovation / remodeling. The lobby was a nightmare and on my final day elevators were not working, making check out a real hassle!Housekeeping is exceptionally noisy and if you're not an early riser (7am) you'll be disturbed. I think this is actually due to the hip but impractical design of the bathrooms -- the frosted glass door to the bathroom must be getting slammed into the tubs to make such resonant booming sounds.The room interiors are pleasant but small. The look is everything the W hotels in the US hope to be. The room I was in had a pants press and ironing board mounted in the closet, but the closet wasn't wide enough to actually iron a shirt. The creepy porter argued with me about this, but I still had to have an iron and board brought up to the room in order to press my clothes.Room service was good. The food was adequate but inconsistent. Sometimes good, sometimes barely average.

<Content>Ultra Modern, Great staff My wife and I stayed at the hotel for one night prior to boarding a river cruise. The hotel is about two blocks from the train station, but is on a relatively quiet street. It is a good location as it is easy to walk to the main shopping district or catch transportation to other venues. We arrived at 9:00 a.m. after a transatlantic flight. We fully expected to be told they would hold our luggage and that we could check in later, but they immediately gave us a room. The staff was very helpful throughout the day. The room was small and ultra modern. The bed was as hard as a rock. There was an additional fee for breakfast, which was a first for us in five trips to Europe. Overall it was a nice hotel in a great location.

I did miss not having a coffee maker in the room....but there was a mini bar. The Casablanca bar was very relaxing and the staff certainly knew their cocktail menu. Breakfast were buffet style, and plentiful. Prices in the hotel were quite expensive, but aren't all 5 star hotels? Not only was it our anniversary, but also my 50th birthday. I had a few cards open in the room and when we returned one day there was a birthday cake on the table. A nice touch. Would return in the future.

<Content>Best hotel I have ever stayed in! I am a terrible traveller in that I never bother to write reviews about the hotels in which I stay. However, this hotel is SO great, that I had to write something! I got there a few hours before check-in, and my room was not ready, so they gave me an upgrade to a Junior Suite. This room was absolutely amazing! It was very clean, stylish, understated but extremely elegant with very comfortable beds, couches and a beautiful big, marble bathroom. The service here was better than I have ever experienced, and I travel A LOT! I wanted to buy a pair of Birkenstoks, so rang down to consierge to see if there was a store in town. He did not know, so called several different stores and the telephone directory assistance, and called me back soon after to give me the names of a few stores where I could go. All the staff were very helpful and I would have absolutely no hesitation in staying here again. Even the room service was great- lovely food and prompt service. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.

<Content>Class Hotel Myself and two friends just returned from a 2 day break in Frankfurt, during which we stayed at Le Meridien Park Hotel. The hotel was beautiful and ideally located. The room was lovely, big and bright, when we walked in with 2 single beds and a sofa/coffee table seating area. We booked a triple room but they advised us at reception that they would be along shortly to put a third bed in. Turned out that they opened out a sofa bed which made the room really small and took the whole luxurious feel away, and resulted in us climbing over or moving excess furniture for the duration. Apart from that the room was spotless and well equipped and the power shower was amazing. We did have a problem with the cleaner walking in on us before 9 on the Sunday morning and waking us all which we found a bit unnecessary. The breakfast was included in our deal and it was one of the best buffets I have ever seen. Really good choice of cold foods, sausage, bacon and boiled egg the only hot food choices, and having to queue while eggs were individually cooked per person was ridiculously time wasting. The one thing I had a big problem with was the fact that we were charged for parking our car in the hotel carpark. We had rented a car to save us some money and ended up being charged 鈧?0 per day to park the car in the hotel. It's the first time we've ever had to pay for parking in any hotel, any where, and it really felt like we were ripped off. Apart from that our overall experience was very good in this hotel with pleasant helpful staff and lovely environment, and I would gladly recommend it. Just leave the car at home!

<Content>Nice business hotel with a good location I stayed just a night at this hotel and will definitely book it for my future stays in Frankfurt. Pluses - excellent location, quiet, newly renovated rooms with good hardware, decent service and including breakfast all for 130 Euros per night (this is a company rate). This hotel is located about 3 mins walk round the corner from the main railway station. It's also only ~20 mins by cab from the airport (cost ~25 Euros). And it's an easy 15-20 min walk to the Zeil, the main shopping district of Frankfurt. But it's nice and quiet thanks to being tucked away in a corner.Rooms - I had a larger-than-usual room (Starwood Platinum upgrade?) in the newly renovated wing with a skyline view - which means it faces away from the street. It was spacious with a modern decor, equipped with ironing board, trouser press and a large flat screen TV mounted to rotate round on a slim vertical pillar in the middle of the room. The in-room aircon thermostat worked well. And the broadband internet connection worked first time, fuss free.Service - fast check in. The non-smoking room I was allocated smelt of cigarette smoke and when I returned to the front desk to ask for a change, they handled this courteously and quickly. Within 5 mins of being in the new room, housekeeping had transferred the fruit plate and bathrobe to the new room. The food served in the restaurant is both good and reasonably priced - I ate there for both breakfast and dinner. The buffet breakfast includes a good selection of fruits, cold meats and breads as well as the usual sausages and bacon, plus a manned egg station. Dinner courses range from about 12 to 25 Euros (pastas starting at 12+, and meat courses at 20 odd)Minuses - prettty minor. Fitness centre closed on Sundays and public holidays (often the case in Europe). No wireless broadband. On my checkout day the housekeeping staff knocked on my door twice in the morning, even though I told them I would be leaving at noon the first time - maybe a problem understanding English. The only significant minus in my book is the beds having foam mattresses - rather surprising given the broad move by many hotel chains to put in super comfy beds. They were OK, but not great.

<Content>Typical Le Meridien high standards If you have stayed in a Le Meridien hotel before then you will know the high standards of service you'll receive. This hotel was very good in all respects; an excellent buffet breakfast started the day. The rooms were spotless and the service of a high standard. We were made to feel very welcome.The restaurant looked good at night but we eat out during our three night stay.The area around the station, like all such areas, can be a bit of dive but, armed with confidence and a bit of street cred, it is not a problem.The handy 'Frankfurt in your Pocket' guide provided by the Hotel was most helpful; highly recommended is the Zwolf Aspostel Restaurant in Rosenbergstrasse - easy to get to on the tube. We also went over the over the river two nights running to the jolly apple wine taverns; again easy to get to on the tube to Lokalbanhof or Frankfurt Sud and walk. We walked back to the hotel at about 1030pm; excellent views of the illuminated skyline and felt perfectly safe into the bargain.Dead easy excursions on the train for us were Mainz and Weisbaden (Mainz preferred) and the lovely little town of Marburg and the Aldstadt there. DBahn web site very good for journey planning click on'International Guests' and you can't go wrong. As regards the public transport system don't forget the Partner ticket valid for 5 adults/2 kids but if there are two of you you don't need to get two tickets for the day/out of town journeys; get the main ticket you want and then use the machine for a supplement ticket which is a cheaper way of doing it. You can change the language on the machine so again, all very easy to work out.

<Content>A night to remember We stayed there in March and had an exceptional time. It is only a couple blocks from the main Frankfurt train station. The staff spoke English, the room was beautiful and had excellent water pressure, a bidet and the best shower I had in a three week trip through Germany. It was exceptionally clean and I am an obsessive compulsive neat freak! The Casablanca bar was lovely, when I saw it; I insisted we had to have a drink before dinner. It was quaint, had live music and a wonderful bartender. The refilled our snack bowl three times and were quick to make any drink we requested, even with my own martini recipes. He then made the best mojito I have ever had and told the legend to go along with it in English. There was wonderful live music that was not too loud to talk over which is unusual. We missed dinner we had such a good time and had to order room service. I would recommend this hotel. Our room was $150

<Content>Warning This hotel is classy, the FO and restaurant staff are excellent but a word of warning concerning the Casablanca Bar. Last week end, I entered with friends, poor welcome, all the staff seemed hypnotised by two noisy North American ladies. I had to lit the candles on the table and request a fresh bowl of snacks, this was received with a frawn by the manager. The order was taken and included a plain tomato juice with seasoning on the side. As the waiter seemed confused, the title of Virgin Bloody Mary was mentionned. I was served a glass of plain tomato juice with salt and pepper cruet. SURPRISE SURPRISE I was charged 鈧?.95. When I queried with the bar manager as a plain tomato juice costed 鈧?3.50, his reply abrupt and unhelpfull even if he tried to look like RICCO in the film  You got virgin Mary, listing all ingredients from lemon juice to celery stick Unfortunately we did not and maybe he should have checked with his staff. One of my guest remembered similar problems previously in that same Bar. Is this a new trend??. One thing for certain, on next Frankfurt trip will consume elsewhere

<Content>Great Location! Great Hotel! I stayed here over Christmas of 2005 and this place was terrific. Great location, a very nice room and helpful and pleasant people. I read the other reviews before I went and I am so glad I ignored them as some people are impossible to please. I would stay here again in a second. A+++

<Content>Best Hotel Of Our Holiday We travelled to Frankfurt by train at the end of November 2005, from Paris. We only stayed one night in Frankfurt, however our flight back to Sydney was due to leave at 23.30pm. The staff were only too happy to accommodate us into the late afternoon so we weren't homeless in the very cold weather. We had a shower in our room before the late night trip to the airport.Even before this the staff were excellent, the food in the restaurant was fantastic, especially the breakfast, where, despite being there right on the scheduled closing time for the breakfast buffet, the young man offered to cook whatever we chose and bring it out to us.Easily the best Hotel we stayed at through Britain, France  Germany.

<Content>Loved it!!! I thought the hotel was wonderful. Please disregard the negative comments from the very few. They are a bunch of spoiled brats. They have not seen how bad it could have been. All the comlaints about the dsl was not so. They charge just like any other hotel charges. That is nothing new. If you are looking for perfect, this is as close as you will get.

<Content>Great stay next tot he station My husband and I stayed at the Meridien Park Hotel for a night while in transit from a Danube river cruise to our home in Switzerland. We paid the equivalent of USD 215 for our room and breakfast. We had a large, beautifully decorated room with huge flat screen TV and great bathroom. It was very quiet and had a lovely view of the skyscrapers of Frankfurt!The service at the hotel was very good. The breakfast buffet was excellent, and we felt as though we wouldn't need to eat lunch on the train on the way home!!The hotel is really close to the station. About a 4 minute walk - or less if you don't have to wait for traffic lights to cross two streets! We were amazed at the quality, since most hotels near stations are, well, grotty! This hotel - an old building with a new extension - was well kept, and most attractive. I would recommend it to anyone travelling by rail, and to people who want to be in that part of Frankfurt.

<Content>Not bad hotel, shame about the City A single night stay in a sound hotel but in an uninspiring City. Car park on site and a well equipped room. It was said to be no smoking but at least one recent guest had smoked. We didn't bother to complain for one night only. Reception fine as was the breakfast.But Frankfurt was, for visitors, rather dull and unattractive. The central market square seemed to be the venue for the all-German scaffolding throwing championships. Some event had clearly just ended but the aftermath was noisy and untidy. The much vaunted Sachsenhausen district wasn't laid back and attractive, as per guide books, but seedy and contrived - we thought.And the next morning, finding our way to the Autobahn towards Prague was difficult and annoying.

<Content>Great Hotel- best of a 2 week vacation- Can't be beat! Our group of six toured Germany and Austria for two weeks. This Hotel was the best and we stayed in several very, very nice ones. Can't understand others' negative reviews- Breakfast here will knock your socks off! Full course dinner was super! Service level and quality of food can't be beat. Rooms are neat, clean, very roomy and well appointed. Can't offer enough positives. Will make it a point to re-visit!
