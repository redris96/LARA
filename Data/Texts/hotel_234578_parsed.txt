<Content>Very, very satisfied Absolutely loved it. Five peaceful nights. A godsend after a horrible apartment rental on the internet. Newly refurbished, huge plasma screens, extremely quiet, comfortable beds, great bathroom, helpful and courteous staff, right near the Born District and close to Olympic Park. Completely enjoyed Barcelona (our favorite European city so far, we are Americans living in Budapest with our teenage daughters) and the Hotel really was an oasis to return to at night. I would go there again, in a second.Nagyon jo szalloda!! Egy nagy IGEN! for my Hungarian friends!

<Content>Great service, clean and convenient We arrived in Barcelona, with nowhere to stay. This hotel is right across the road from the Main International Train Station. We walked in, and the receptionist was very friendly, and gave us a reasonable price.It was very clean, the service was excellent.The buffet breakfast was great, the one guy cleaning all the tables and getting new cutlery worked like a mad man with so many guests, but still was extremely friendly.

<Content>OK Location is very good - especially if you are arriving or leaving from Franca train station (just across the street. Easy stroll through old quarter or waterfront. Rooms are clean but very plain and small. Excellent breakfast buffet includes eggs sunny side up (plus the usual scrambled eggs) and lots of other food choices. Hotel staff competent and polite.

<Content>Everything we needed at good prices For the prices we paid, Park Hotel was completely suitable. The rooms were cleaned completely every day - which is a massive relief for people who have been to the beach and filled their bathroom with sand! And the fully functioning air conditioning came in very handy. Plenty of toiletries provided, and we didn't have to call reception once during our stay to ask for extras or complain about anything. There was an issue with a powercut, but it was fixed as quickly as possible. Friendly and helpful staff. The breakfast is included, and although not particularly varied (the hot selection wasn't amazing), there was plenty of bread, cereals and yoghurts, as well as hot drinks and fruit juice.The location is as good as it could have got - for us, at least. You can walk anywhere centrally very easily, and it's only about a 15 minute walk to the beach or harbour. Plus it's out of the way, so you don't feel overwhelmed on a busy street every time you step out of the door.Lovely and quiet room (we were located at the back) so that the only loud noise we heard all week were the festival fireworks!

<Content>Absolutely loved this Hotel! My wife and I traveled to Spain for our Honeymoon and stayed at this hotel for our first 2 nights before traveling on. We loved this hotel... conveniently located right in front of the Train station made getting to and from the airport a breeze! Also, located in the charming area of El Born which had great food, bars and walking distance to everything.... minus the Gaudi Church and Parc Guell. Close to the beach, Las Ramblas, Barri Gotic, picasso museum, Santa Maria del Mar, Catedral and more.. Read some reviews about the bad breakfast but we found it to be amazing... Huge with plenty of options to choose from. Tasty meats and cheeses, fresh juice and fruit, eggs, bacon, cereal, yogurt, breads, etc... Upon the end of our 2 week trip we flew out of Barcelona and decided to stay in the L'Eixample area on the last night... big mistake. Our hotel there was great but the area is nothing compared to what surrounds this gem! We loved the Park Hotel and if we ever return to Barcelona we will definitely stay here! Do bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper and you're staying on the weekend.

<Content>Great place, but don't use the phone!!! Before I forget, one word of advice for the Park Hotel (which probably applies to most Spanish hotels? not sure): DO NOT USE THE PHONE IN YOUR ROOM. They don't disclose this in any place, but you will be charged 60 euro cents/minute for a local call. Yep, even if you're calling the restaurant next door. AND, I found to my dismay, even for calling a toll-free number. I had to change some travel arrangements with an airline, and called their Spain toll-free number. When I checked out, I was charged nearly 20 euro. Yikes. I told the management that they should make this clear in their phone instructions, especially because in the USA toll-free calls are always free, even from hotel phones. I travel frequently in Europe and have never been charged this much for a phone call. That being said, I very much liked the Park Hotel. Booked through Venere.com and was very happy with everything-- the price, the location, and the room itself. The staff was friendly (though I'm sure the guy at the front desk was silently cursing me while discussing the phone call charge). My room was very small, as a single, but perfect for me, very comfortable, with its own thermostat for A/C, and super clean. I also appreciated the user-friendly safe in the closet, so I could lock up my passport and wallet during the day and only carry a bit of cash with me (I'd heard Barcelona was famous for pick-pocketing. and the second night a woman 3 feet from me on a main street had her purse snatched. That's when I decided to leave the valuables in the hotel safe!) The bathroom was huge and had a full sized tub, which was heavenly after spending four days in London in a hostel. Great TV, including BBC world and National Geographic. Wonderful breakfast- eggs, bacon to fruit and cereal. Walking distance to the old city center (and the beach, though I wouldn't recommend Barcelona's beaches), and the Estacio de Franca across the street (a beautiful old station, not scummy like some city train stations) makes getting to the airport a dream. Even if you arrive at Sants station, you can jump on the airport trian (C10) in the opposite direction and be at Franca in 5 minutes. A great find, highly recommended. Barcelona in August is another story... avoid it! The quality of the hotel was probably the best thing about my stay there. I'd love to go back during another season of the year.

<Content>Friendly hotel in perfect location We are budget travellers and, though not dirt cheap, this was one of the lowest priced hotels available over a summer weekend and it was a delight.The location was perfect. Almost across the road from the Franca station which has direct trains to the airport, around the corner from the Barceloneta metro station and a short walk to a lovely park containing the zoo and to a hop-on hop-off bus stop. The old town started just behind the hotel and we took an easy ramble through it to get to Las Ramblas, the main touristy boulevard. The beach front, with its masses of restaurants, was about a 10 minute walk, and a few minutes further was the start of the cable car that goes over the harbour area. The room was compact, but not small and tastefully decorated and (big plus) the air con worked well. Noise wise - the window was double glazed, but some muffled partying did carry up.Continental breakfast was good, but not brilliant and best of all was in a spacious room with attentive staff... (this is rare - breakfasts are usually cramped and rushed).The hotel had a bar which opened onto the street with tables and chairs on the pavement where one could sit and watch the passing scene - which buzzes until all hours. We had read that people only get going at 10-11pm, but did not realise there would be families (push chairs, toddlers, dogs) wandering around at midnight ! The staff were charming. The barman, with little English, but brilliant sign language, was lovely.I would be delighted to go back there.On another note: The hop-on hop-off bus routes are varied and long. It almost rivals London. There are two routes that take 4 hours (add some for the drivers who get off at stops and disappear for 5 minutes at a time) and a third that takes 2 hours. So if you are going to do this (recommended), leave a whole day just for doing the routes and not getting off much. We did the bus for a day to orientate ourselves and then bought a 10 trip metro/bus card to get back to places we could not walk to.Dress is very casual (shorts and slops all over, all times) and the city is very relaxed.

<Content>A Wonderful Find In Barcelona My wife, 13 year old son, and I stayed here for two nights following a cruise. I read about the hotel on the web on multiple sites, including Trip Advisor. We wanted to be reasonably close to Las Ramblas and the Old City, and we wanted a reasonable price for the hotel, particularly given the poor exchange rate for the U.S. dollar. We were delighted with the result.The hotel is directly across from the Estacio Franco, so one can whisk from the airport to the hotel in an air conditioned train, cross the street, and enter the hotel. It is a short walk to the Picasso Museum, and the hotel backs up to the Ciutat Vella (Barri Gotic). We were also walking distance to the sea, and only a 30 minute walk from Sagrada Familia (a walk we would recommend)The room was reasonably spacious by European standards, with a fold out couch/bed for our son and two twins together as a double for my wife and me. The bath was actually large and spacious, and well equipped with every amenity from hair dryer to bidet to high pressure shower. Breakfast was included and to our surprise and enjoyment included eggs and bacon as well as wonderful croissants, fresh squeezed orange juice, cheese, and the traditional elements of a continental breakfast. Wireless Internet was also provided without additional charge.We enjoyed large bath towels, good air conditioning, a a free safe in the room for valuables.There is a lounge on the 1st or 2nd floor (lobby is 0) with comfortable chairs, etc. The staff was quite fluent in English and extraordinarily gracious and helpful. The hotel was perfect for our needs in every way--comfortable, reasonably priced, conveniently located, and aesthetically pleasing, as well as clean. We would readily return the next time we are in Barcelona. We had 4 or 5 star amenities at a 2 star price.

<Content>Good hotel in great location We had a positive experience at the Park Hotel. Before our arrival, the staff was really helpful when working on our reservation over the course of several emails. The location (right by the Franca train station and in the cool, fun Born neighborhood) was excellent. Our room was small, but it was clean and sleek. We faced the alley on the side of the hotel, so it was completely quiet. Overall we felt like we found a good deal in a wonderful city.

<Content>Great Location, Excellent Hotel We booked through Venere based on reviews and were very happy we did. The price was great for what we got. The rooms are contemporary (flat screen tv) and the location is excellent. It's right near the hip/young area with great restaurants  bars. Check out Origins 99% (always packed). Breakfast was excellent, tons of food and freshly squeesed juice. The staff is very friendly and will answer any questions and be extremely helpful with your time in Barcelona. Excellent place but would recommend getting a room with a balcony and a view if possible. We had a view of a street facing a bld but really enjoyed the place either way. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for your trip to Barcelona.

<Content>The ultimate test of any foreign hotel... ...is when one is sick. This is when quality comes out (or runs away at top speed).I am posting my review here very, very late because I only just stumbled over the journal entry about this hotel. We stayed here for a business conference and at first, it wasn't much to look at. But then it grew on me. Efficient use of space and pretty good sized bathroom...overall, clean, clean, clean. At a good location (across from the train station) and not too far from the metro, near La Catedral and not too far walking distance from las Ramblas but almost right around the corner from the best hole-in-the-wall-tapas and sangria place. Unfortunately, I enjoyed my sangria that nite so when I wrote the journal entry, I forgot to write down the name of the place (aside from the kudos on how awesome everything was). Breakfasts were the same every day but lots of food, a very friendly dining staff who kept us well plied with caffe con leche.Most importantly was how they treated me when I was sick. And I was so sick with the flu when I first arrived. No problems. They directed my partner to a nearby Farmacia, made sure he had lots of food and liquids to bring me on breakfast trays and most wonderfully, watched when I stumbled out for a 45 minute breath of fresh air so they could nip in, scrub the room thoroughly and nip back out.....all after normal cleaning hours too. Because of this helpful and caring attitude, what could have been the worst vacation due to illness, turned out to be one of the best I ever had - I was able to get better and totally enjoy my stay. I'd definitely stay here again.

Plenty of choice for breakfast too. Perfect location we thought. Loved the area behind the hotel for restaurants/bars. Just across the road from the train station. For some reason on both journeys to and from the airport we didn't have to pay! Did we miss something?

<Content>good location, perfect for sightseeing Stayed here for weekend with with friends, we had a double and triple room. While the rooms were compact they were perfect for our needs, We did not spend a lot of time in the Hotel. The bathroom in the double was however very small. The rooms were very clean and well serviced. The breakfast was included in our deal and it was fine, plenty of everything do not expect gourmet. We stayed in the front of the hotel and the noise from the busy street below did not bother us at all, it may bother others however. The Hotel is located near the Gothic district and is not too far from the marina and La Rambla. There are some great cafes and bars very nearby. If you want a reasonable priced hotel within walking distances of these places, I would recommend the Park Hotel. The staff were great too espeically the night porter.

<Content>Let down by the Park I feel that the reviews were over complimentary about the Park Hotel. Maybe we got a crappy rate, 165 Euros for a twin with breakfast, but this seems pricey for a 3 star hotel. It paints itself as a boutique hotel but it definitely is not. The decor is tacky and chintzy. The location near El born was excellent but this was one of the only pros. For the same price I think you can stay in much nicer hotels in Barcelona that are also central.Our shower was blocked and would not drain, after 2 requests this was resolved, our rooms were often not serviced until 4pm, despite the fact we'd been out all day.I felt quite let down and would not return

<Content>Just ok We had two rooms on the first floor overlooking the alleyway on the left (when facing the hotel). One room (130) was spacious and quite good but we had problems with the other (129).In 129 we had a shutter that wouldn't open, air-conditioning that didn't work and the presistent smell of a smoking guest. On one morning the hot water was cold (this was for the whole hotel)!Breakfast was ok but on one morning there were some really over ripe fruit on offer.The hotel offered a cheaper rate (15EUR/day BEFORE VAT!) in the car-park around the corner. There was a bus stop for the tourist bus (blue line) just to the left when exiting the hotel.

<Content>Great Value Hotel in Excellent Location My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in March 07. At approx EUR112 per night including breakfast (booked through Venere.com) this hotel was fantastic value. Excellent location, on the edge of El Born, many restaurants and bars close by. Modern, recently decorated rooms. Only downside was the rooms did not keep out the noise very well. We requested a quiet room and I think we got one of the quietest rooms, at the back of the hotel, but still woken by noise of staff etc at 5am. Bring earplugs.

<Content>excellent hotel My boyfriend and I just returned from a 3 day stay at the park hotel in Barcelona. We booked the hotel the morning we went to barcelona on a hotel website as it was a last minute holiday so we really didnt know what to expect from the hotel. When we got to the hotel we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel room was great with air conditioning and a very modern decor. My boyfriend was extra impressed by the 30 inch flat screen tv and minibar in the room!The location is really great too. Its just around the corner from the metro. The bus turistic for the city goes from just down the road and its directly across the road from estacio de Franca which is the major station for trains going to and coming from France. About a 5 minute walk away is the aquarium and the pier where its nice to walk along and see all the boats and some good restaurants are located there too.It's only a 5-10 minute walk to the bottom of las ramblas but if you get the hang of walking up and down to the centre of the city you will find your way down all the shortcuts through the Gothic quarter where the streets are really narrow and quirky with some great cafes and shops. I really though that this hotel was good value, The hotel was only 鈧?0 a night which for the quality of the rooms, we thought was great value. I would definatley recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very Very good 3 star Three of my friends and I have just returned from a 4 day stay in Barcelona where we stayed in the Park Hotel which was recommended to me by a colleague. This hotel is really a great 3 star so dont be fooled by the exterior view or the reception area. We booked 2 twin rooms and while 1 was definately larger than the other, they were still really comfortable and for a 3 night stay were definately perfect. It does seem that some of the rooms can be very small so it might be advisable to check and see if there are different room categories so that a larger room can be booked.the location of the hotel is really great with the hop on hop off tour bus stop a 1 min walk away and some really nice tapas bars in the area. It was really hot and busy in Barcelona and it was great to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel. Breakfast at the hotel is excellent, much better than a 3 star standard, with fantastic choice and the breakfast staff are excellent. Overall I would say this is probably the best 3 star hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday and my friends and I are extremely fussy, ( we work in the hotel industry!)

<Content>Great Hotel - just right. The Park Hotel Barcelona was a very pleasant place to stay. We just got back from a 2-night stay there and certainly couldn't fault it for its 3-star rating - I'm not sure what it would need for four stars but it had everything we could need. The room was clean, in an excellent state of repair and decoration and everything worked. It was renovated in 1990 (17 years ago) but it has certainly been looked after since then. The 1950's design still shows through beautifully. For us, who like to wander around, the location was spot on. Next to the park, and about 2 minutes walk to the Gothic Quarter (great for the bustle of restaurants, bars and shops in beautiful buildings.) It would take maybe 15 minutes walk to Las Ramblas (if you REALLY want bustle) but the time taken was hard to judge as we took a leisurely meander through the streets, bars and shops, with plenty to occupy and distract you on the way. The marina and the beach are also only five minutes away. If you wanted to venture further, there are bus routes and metro stations very nearby.The other great part about its location is that the Estacion Franca (train station) is just across the road (no noise from that either!) We cautiously took a 25 euro taxi on the way in from the airport, but found that the train got us back to the airport in the same time (about 40 mins) for a mere 2.50 euros each!Our room was a simple double which overlooked a side street (no balcony, but I think some were available on other sides of the hotel). When I say side street, don't picture rubbish skips and winos - we were just facing another similar block of old buildings and roof terraces where normal Spanish people lived and hang out their washing on Sundays. We had one night when we heard a few late-night revellers staggering home but other than that we had a pleasant night's sleep. We certainly didn't suffer any noise from within the hotel as some other people have had.If I had to make a bad comment it would be about the breakfast (we didn't book dinner). While the food was reasonable and the choice was decent, they sometimes struggled to keep up with the steady flow of guests (get there before 9 to avoid the queues) so we were sometimes left scouring the crumbs of the half-empty buffet table. But, serves you right for being a lazy bones - get up early enough and then get exploring the city!

<Content>Great hotel I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend for 3 nights at the end of March 2007 and would recommend it. I was pleasantly surprised by the standard of the bedroom, which appeared to be of 4 star standard. We were fortunate to get a smart room with a balcony to the front of the hotel. The room is a good size with a huge flat screen tv, safe, large bathroom and comfortable beds. The only thing missing were shower gel etc in the bathroom. We booked on [----] at a reasonable rate - 鈧?12 a night. This included breakfast which was lovely. The location of the hotel is perfect - in the desirable old town Born area with its wihding lanes, amazing architecture, little boutiques and a variety of restaurants. The metro is just around the corner and the open bus tour is a few metres down the road.A couple of tips: if you are arriving at the main train/bus station Sants, taxis are cheap and much easier than getting the metro as you have to lug suitcases up and down steps. Buy a 2 day bus tour (Bus Turistic is the best company) instead of 1 day. It onlycost 鈧?3 as opposed to 鈧?9 and there is too much to see all on one day!

We could hear people talking in their bathroom and lots of noise from showers and toliet flushing. I've heard a lot of Barcelona hotels are noisy because of all the street partying. This would not be a problem at this hotel as it is in a lovely area. But the noise from within is a problem. Bring earplugs.

<Content>Good Value and Great Location I decided to stay here after reading a glowing review in an article in the Conde Nast Traveller magazine (April 2006 issue) featuring stylish and affordable hotels in Barcelona. The facade first catches the eye with its distinctive architectural style. The rooms are mimimalist in style and are very clean. The mattress was very firm which I like however the pillows were these tube-shaped ones which I don't particularly care for.The breakfast buffet was wonderful and I understand that the restaurant is considered one of the best in the city. Not much in terms of amenities but at 120 Euro for a Double you can't expect too much. There is a Plasma DVD however the only English-language station I could find was BBC World.The only complaint was that it was unseasonably warm however it was not possible to cool the room as the ventilation system had not yet been switched over to the a/c.The hotel is situated in the El Born district not far from the Barceloneta beach. A lot of traffic passes in front of the hotel so make sure to ask for a room that's not facing the main street.

<Content>Marvelous Hotel I looked into a number of hotels in Barcelona and settled on the Park on the advice of a friend. You can stay in the more expensive, luxurious hotels, but for the price and location, the Park Hotel cannot be beat. A modern architectural landmark of distinction, the hotel is well run and well maintained. The rooms are comfortable, quiet and nicely designed, as well as spotlessly clean. I spent a week in Barcelona and would definitely stay at the Park again.

<Content>Gem of a hotel in funky area A fabulous find in the funky and un-touristy La Ribera or Born district. A privately run hotel, its emphasis is on modern, tasteful decor and cool black  white photographs adorn the walls. The buffet breakfast is really great; pastries, cereal, ham. cheese, toast, eggs, bacon and jugs of delicious freshly squeezed orange juice!Within 2 mins walk there are loads of great restaurants and cool bars to choose from , as well as boutique independent shops. It is 5 mins from Parc de la Ciudella and 10 mins walk from Port Vell. Prices were 鈧?17 per night (single person inc breakfast). NB, if you are a non-smoker, ensure you ask for a room on one of the non-smoking floors. Also, request a room at the back , or on the side, as the front of the hotel faces a busy main road.I will definitely stay there again!

<Content>Great, Friendly, Clean, Cool, Little Hotel! A very nice, lovely hotel located perfectly for your visit to Barcelona. Hotel staff was very friendly, room were even cleaner! Air-conditioning worked fabulously! The little cafes, coffee shops, and restaurants nearby were all very good and very friendly. I have stayed in Barcelona before, downtown, fancy hotel; however it was not as clean or as friendly as this great establishment! I would and will recommend this hotel to anybody coming to Barcelona for a visit.
