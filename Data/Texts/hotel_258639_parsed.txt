<Content>Did not honor Suite reservation We had booked a Suite thru Expedia because the regular rooms did not have a King bed. When we checked in the receptionist was angry we had sucha good room rate and so he would not honor the contract.We called expedia and they faxed the rate and confirmationto the hotel. They then gave us a very barren suite with abed smaller than any King I have ever slept in. Their attitude alone would keep me from ever returning nomatter what the price of the room.

<Content>Kind of a dump I stayed at the Dorchester recently while visiting Art Basel Miami Beach. The location can't be beat, but the hotel itself is very shabby. Sloppy paint job, scuffs and chips everywhere, the bathroom was very dingy, and the entire place smelled stale--except in the places where it smelled overwhelmingly of very cheap air freshener. The beds were clean but the sheets were like sleeping on burlap. I would not have dreamed of letting my feet touch the floor in the bathroom. The television was ancient and every channel (about 6 channels are available total) had a very green picture. The telephones have instructions that are completely unrelated to the actual operation of the phone. The one good thing I can say about the room is that they have put wood laminate flooring in rather than carpet, so it seemed much cleaner that way.Wireless access is available in the lobby--for a fee of $5/hour. When are hotels going to get over this ridiculous charge?The staff is pretty friendly and some are helpful. There is a nice courtyard as you enter the hotel with chairs and tables--a good place to sit and enjoy the beautiful weather--and to escape your room.Do not pay more than $200 for a room here. The location is great, but the hotel itself is pretty much of a dump.

<Content>we liked it at the beginning of our trip we had a suite which was not in the main building. these rooms were not that nice but at least clean. when we got back to miami we first checked into a different place which ended up being a total [--] wo we went back to the dorchester. we then got a room in the main building which was very nice. nice dark wooden floors, nice clean bedding.. ahhh lovely. you should know that parking costs an extra 25 USD a day. They also charge you 4 USD a day for energy costs. The breakfast costs 15 USD a person but was very nice with pan cakes, french toast, eggs, bacon, cereal, fruits, coffee etc. we would go back there.

<Content>Very disapointing We booked to stay here for 3 nights in total, two at the beginning of our stay in Miami and the other the night before flying out of Miami. This hotel was recommended to us so we were disapointed to read others comments on tripadvisor about how The Dorchester was not up to standard. Despite our reservations we stayed there. First of all we were greated with an increased rate for the rooms which we had pre-paid, the receptionist could not explain what the $4 per room per night additional charge was for, having been on a long flight we just wanted our rooms so did not question further. The pool is a good size, however there is little room to walk around the pool as the sunbeds go right up to the edge. Watch out for the pool bar staff, who walk round offering drinks to any newcomers to the pool and eventually presents you with the bill, over double what you pay in any other bar, $5.45 + TAX for a small can of beer!!! Upon checking out we found someone who could explain the $4 additional room rate charge, this is for energy as the prices locally have gone up so they told us. An air conditioner in one of the rooms fell apart at 4am, there was no safe in the room which was included in the pre-paid price (we had booked and paid for the rooms on their own website), breakfast was not included, again this was included in the price on their website, needless to say we did not return there for our pre-paid last night.

<Content>Nice 'n Clean! I had the pleasure of staying at the Dorchester on 7-10-08 thru 7-13-08. This was a girl's escapade! My friend  I were quite impressed with the hotel. We were almost certain that we were going to be staying in a DUMP based on the reviews we had read. However, it was definitely the opposite! Whatever you do: DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS...THEY OVER EXAGGERATE!THE STAFF: Pleasant  helpfulTHE ROOM: Two very comfortable queen size beds, with white sheets  a white bed spread, which definitely lets you know that it is clean! We requested a renovated room, so we had hard wood floors, which were swept  mopped daily. The bathroom was small, but clean. Towels  toiletries were stocked daily. The 19 inch tv was out-dated , but who cares? We came to South Beach to par-tay!!! The a/c unit was an oldie, but goodie. Our room was aleast 60 degrees or cooler (burr!). Other reviews complained about the walls being thin, but we didn't hear anything. We slept like babies for 3 nights!THE POOL AREA: Was decent. There was a poolside bar. Happy hour was daily from 7p-8p. Only cheap liquors were free!THE HALLWAYS: You could tell the carpet was worn  old, but they filled the hallways with a pleasant air freshener daily.THE LOBBY: Was very artsy  contemporary. Having an ATM was very convenient  safe. The piano was a great accent to any photo shot!PARKING: Seemed to be a little congested, but workable.***Just keep in mind that this is NOT a 5 star hotel, only a 3 1/2! For the price, it is definitely a steal! Very convenient to SB  just a quaint, comfortable, clean place to stay if you are looking to explore more of South Beach and not the actual room! Perfect for a girl's or guy's trip only! Wouldn't plan a romantic getaway here.

<Content>Be Carefull, Hidden costs My Wife and I stayed at the Dorchester for one week. April 08.English is not the 1st language of any of the staff on reception. Communication was a problem when asking for directions or almost anything else. Room was cleaned daily but noise from the Shore Club opposite was a problem,with car horns sounding throughout the night and early morning. The self parking spaces are very limited on the front of the Dorchester and very tightly packed in. Only upon my arrival back in the U.K some weeks later on receipt of my credit card statement did I realise that the Dorchester had charged me $196.95 for six days parking. At no time on arrival or any other time was parking charges mentioned.

<Content>good but surly receptionist The hotel was clean and air conditioned (with a $4 per night charge that they don't tell you about). Rooms were ok, no complaints. The hotel could do with some refurbishment of the rooms but the foyer was lovely. My only complaint was at the front desk, with a woman called Viji-who was very rude to all female residents but most friendly with the male ones (much to our amusement). The pool area was lovely, with free drinks from 7-8pm. Very central. If you rent a car DONT PARK at the hotel-it costa $30 per night and parking on the street is safe and costs very little ($4 per night max)

<Content>Dont bring your personal juice by the pool I had a bit of a mix up with the hotel due to me booking through book it .com the suite that I reserved with a king bed and a pullout sofa wasnt available so I ended up with a room with a queen bed. Despite that and the fact that the pool side bar didnt have what I wanted to drink (Mountain Dew Soda) They wouldnt allow me to drink my soda by the pool. that sucked But overall the staff was wonderful atmosphere was warm and cozy. Great location I would most definetaly stay there again.

<Content>You get what you pay for - but that麓s about it The only reason why this hotel earns two stars is that the price -considering the trendy location- was OK for what we got.Be prepared to adjust your expectations when you go there. Friends of ours stayed at the Marseilles next door (sister property) with -compared to us - high expectations and got terribly dissappointed.We saw the Marseilles room too and it was not a lot better than ours for 50% more of the price per night.For the price we paid and the reviews i read, my expecations were very low, but then the cab driver dropped us of in front the DORSET (wrong hotel) and looking at it from the outside, we were pleasantly surprised, not realizing that it was not our hotel :-) So a block down the road we finally find the DORCHESTER:** When we arrived they did not find our reservation, even when we left three days later, our travelocity reservation was not in their system yet. But nevertheless they had a room they gave us.** Our phone did not work and we asked them every single day to fix it during our 3 night stay. But nobody fixed it.** We wanted to rent a car for sunday, but surprise surprise - WiFi did not work in our room either. The staff did not make any attempt to fix that.** The receptionist offered to help us get a car for sunday morning, so we trusted her and postponed the car search to the next day. What she really meant by helping us was to call THEIR car rental service to find out at 8.30 am in the morning that it is still closed. GREAT. So she advises us to go to 23rd street cause we would find 3 car rental companies there. Of course we do not find 3 car rentals. Only one. And that one did not have a car for us. So we return to the hotel by 9.30, pissed and without a car and i ask the receptionist if i can call some car rentals from the hotel lobby. No she says you can use the phone in your room. HAHA. VERY FUNNY. If somebody had fixed it, i would have probably used it already.Probably i should try to reserve a car online with the great wireless service you provide?** Don t go for the full breakfast buffet, it is not worth it. Rather go to Catalinas next door, their breakfast and ambiente is excellent!** Air condition in our room was only a small device in the wall that did not really help to get rid of the humidity in the room. So it happened that wet towels were still wet the next morning. Also, the bed cover always felt kind of wet, which should not be the case if the air condition works properly.** Our Queen bed had the size of a double - They promised to give us a King room the next morning, but this also did not happen.As bad as it probably might sound right now, the hotel is not a un-acceptable place. It is ok for a budget weekend in South Beach if your expecations are accordingly low. And there are in fact better things to do than hanging out in a hotel room when you spend a weekend in South Beach, ;-). That was the reason why we looked for something basic. The only nice things were the interior of the lobby, the pool, the pool bar and the fact that the Marseilles also sucked. So we spent at least less money for a similar experience.But seriously guys: Even though I did not expect any luxury for a 115 bucks, just some competent and friendly faces from the staff members would have been enough for me to recommend it and come back. That麓s the basics.

<Content>Great experience We had 6 rooms booked at Marseilles Hotel and were called a few days before our trip that we were being moved to the Dorchester. After reading the reviews I called and told them we were not happy with the things we had read. Since we were going to a wedding we felt there was not much we could do. We were told that they were taking money off our bills and that if possible would be upgraded to a suite. Two of us got suites, which were large and nicely furnished. The beds and bedding appeared new. All six rooms were very clean and everyone was happy that we had been moved. We all agreed that we would go back to this hotel

<Content>Great location....thats it! My girls and I took a mini vacation. The hotel is in a fantastic spot, we never needed a car for anything. Right across the street from The Shore Club, a few minutes from the beach and close to restaurants. But it stops there! The rooms are absolutely horrible. The view was a cement wall, the carpet and bedding is really outdated. Harldly no outlets to even charge our cell phones! The front desk are actually very nice and funny. But they ran out of towels twice when we needed extras. I can go on and on. Its only a good hotel if you are just looking for a place to rest your head and you are more into the South Beach scene than your hotel stay.

<Content>Choose Another Hotel! I researched this hotel through travelocity. After several attempts to call to make a reservation, I almost gave up due to the fact they would connect you to no extension or an extension that just rang and rang. I should have given up.Finally, I did get through to a reservationist who was very nice.In summary, the place is not clean, in need or renovation and the people are not helpful. In addition, after leaving the hotel to go to the beach, I came back to my room completely open. Turns out construction folks had to come in and they just left it open afterward. I had another nights stay in Miami and immediately checked out and went to an AMAZING cute, clean and renovated hotel around the corner called The Cadet. Highly recommend and same price.I am shocked they charge what they charge.

<Content>Great Location....but that's really all you get.....nothing more! I stayed here for a few days over NYE 2008. Great location! Close to the Shore Club, Delano and the Beach. The rooms were very old and need a lot of remodelling, but it was actually quite large. The bathroom is way out of date and they could use a new shower curtain and fixtures. We booked through expedia or orbitz (can't remember). I remember reading about a $1.00 a day safe charge. We stayed for three nights and had no 'incidentals' when we checked out but they did charge us $3.00 cash ($1.00 a day for the safe even though we didn't use it). We didn't have the time to argue.

<Content>Disappointed...deceiving website I stayed January 2007. I spent numerous hours researching hotels in South Beach, and this seemed like a good one. The website was beautiful. www.hoteldorchester.com I had a queen bed. When I checked in, I asked if there were any upgrades available. The front desk attendant was playing video games and briefly ignored me. I was told that the hotel is under renovation, and the 2nd floor was closed. Parking was $25 a night. I thought that was a bit high. I paid for one day of parking and then went down the street to 16th St and parked for $8. I suggest unloading in the hotel 20 minute zone and then parking down the street to save money. It's $1/hr. with $8 max. The room smelled..the carpet was old and stained, and had been repaired with newer carpet patches, making several patches of bright green carpet mixed with the old worn and dull green carpet. The bed had a HUGE dip in it. I could see before I even laid down. I found my sleep very uncomfortable and kept rolling toward the center. The blinds (vertical shades) in the bathroom were falling down...I could see the screw between the shades and the top of the window. There were also cobwebs. On the positive side, the lobby was nice, the pool looked nice (I didn't go) the room was a decent size, and the bathroom was nicely tiled with wall paint on the edges of the mirror (not good). If I were to do it again, I would have paid a bit more and stayed at another hotel. Location was also pretty good....close to Lincoln. Hope this review helped you...good luck.

<Content>They have sold our room although it was confirmed and even reconfirmed. We have booked the room on the hotel www with my credit card, which was not charged. I have got also the confirmation with the number as usual. The day of the stay I have called up the hotel and reconfirmed our arrival also mentioned that we shall be arriving later in the evening. The hotel worker told me that the room is held until mindnight if booked with a credit card. Upon our arrivial the night receptionist told us, that they are fully booked and have no room for us no matter the printed confirmation. We were standing at the desk and asking for explanation. Our room was twice confirmed and still we have no place to sleep in the middle of the night. The receptionist was not willing to help us in any way. We have asked her to provide us a room at a different hotel as it usually happens in case of overbooking, but she was not willing to do anything.Terrible.. Would never book the hotel again. In the future I will rather book a more expencive room, but I want to have the service which I am promised.

<Content>A negative gesture for the Dorchester Bring your earplugs to this hotel. The walls in the room are like cardboard, I was literally listening to the family's conversation next door whether I wanted to or not. It was also noisy outside but I expected that being that it is located in Miami Beach. The internet service was terrible. I can't stress how un-user friendly it was. Do not stay here if you're on a business trip.I felt bad for the staff at the front desk as they tried their hardest but were continuosly bombarded by phone calls and answering guests questions. They were very accomodating at getting me a cab though and I thank them for that.This location is in good walking distance from South Beach but Lincoln Road is right around the corner which was a really cool street to hang out on and eat. I can't remember the name of the little pizza shack on Lincoln but it was the best pizza I've ever had.If you are looking for a place to crash after partying in South Beach and Lincoln Road and you're easily going to pass out when you go to bed then this could be the perfect hotel for you. But if you're here for business or relaxation, STAY AWAY!

<Content>Not good There are 2 things good about this hotel: location if you want to stay in South Beach (however, our first room was facing the street and was WAY TOO noisy. We asked for another one and received it next day) and swimming pool.There was strong smell everywhere, rooms in bad condition, not enough parking spots (you don't have to pay for nights when there were no spots, make sure you let the front desk know the same day). We were charged for the room safe even though we never used it (reversed by request).

<Content>Worst ... Hotel ... Ever My company booked a room for me here, so the hotel must've charged a corporate rate. What I found when I checked in was nothing short of disastrous.There was no TV in the room! I called the lobby and asked for a TV ... and they acted as if I had committed a sin. It took until the second day of my stay before I received a 13-inch TV, without a remote control, accompanied by an envelope requesting a tip.I don't know how their website claims free wireless internet. There was no wireless internet service at all, and when I asked for wired service, I was charged $10 a day.Breakfast is prepared by an overworked little old lady. Clearly not geared to people who have to work early in the morning. While I am used to having hotels serve breakfast around 6am, the signs posted at this place declared a 7:30am start. Not too bad, I thought ... but when I came down at 7:30am, the little old lady clearly had not readied everything. There was cereal - but no milk. Coffee was made, but no cups were available. I decided it was faster to go out for breakfast.I asked for a manager, and I was told there were no managers on staff. Is this possible?I've stayed in plenty of hotels, some not as good as others. But the level of service I received here was as close as one could get to crap. I later found out that for $20 more, I could've had a real hotel (just across the street).

<Content>Terrible hotel -- stay away!! What a disasterous stay we had at the Dorchester Suites! First of all, we booked a suite for four people, only to be told upon arrival that there is only a room with one queen bed available. We found out throughout our stay that at least three other people had booked suites but did not get one upon check-in. I'm not even sure there are actual suites at this hotel! The room was small and nothing like the pictures online. The window airconditioning units were extremely loud and we heard other people at the hotel complaining about the toilets running all night and poor water pressure in the showers. The electronic card/keys we were given had to be continually reset because they wouldn't always open the door to the room. Of course, once one was reset, everybody else's keys had to be reset too! There were never enough towels for the rooms, we had to wait until 6-7pm one day to get clean towels -- we were told they were in the wash! We never got to sit out at the pool because there weren't enough chairs and anytime we complained to the staff, we were looked at with vacant stares and nothing was accomplished. This hotel really ruined our weekend and I will never stay there again, nor do I recommend it to anyone!! Especially if you expect to get a suite!

<Content>It was perfect It doesn't compete with all the big fancy places in Miami, but it is in the perfect location. When in Miami, if you arent' planning to stay at a resort then this is great. You are a minute walk to the beach and the shopping. If you plan to enjoy shopping, restaurants, nightlife, and the beach then stay here. It gives you all you'll need.

<Content>A Dump The hotel website was cute and clean. It boasted a multi million dollar renovation. It also had a fabulous location on Collins Ave in the heart of SoBe. However, upon arrival the staff was virtually non-existent and employees present were useless. It seems the renovations were done in the lobby area only. The rooms were disgusting. I went with 3 other friends, so we had 3 rooms between us. One room was worse than the next. They were rundown, with the AC unit dripping water on the floor, bullet holes in the curtains, strange noises. There was a mildew odor in the room and the walls were beaten up. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless I hated them. It was disgusting and I would never stay there again. It was not worth any $.

<Content>Pleased! At first I was worried because of all the negative review that I saw online. Once I got there I was at ease with seeing the reception area and greeted by the staff. The room was spacious and clean. Staff was pleasant throughout the whole trip. My only concern was them charging my account and having to do some reversing but other than that my stay was pleasing... I would stay here again... The night life was okay.. only thing is that they was not that much of a choice for getting something to eat .. Only a pizza/gyro place across the street that charged an arm and a leg for a meal..LOLI would recommend people to come here.. I was lucky enough to get a suite. I dont know how the other rooms are situated so I cant comment on that.. But I would like to thank the staff at the Dorchester for showing us a great experince at their establishment..I usually come to Miami in October every year... As long as I can get the same service from you I will stay there....Again thanks for everything.... People please if there is something that you need or that you are not pleased with you should go directly to the frontdesk and advise a staff member and they would be more than glad to help you but if you dont say anything they your stay there would be miserable...I think that you should try this hotel out..try me you would enjoy your stay.

My now wife called my cell as i was trying to find a parking spot and told me to bring some scented candles or incence to cover up the smell of must and mold inside the room. and she was not kidding!! this place hasnt been updated in 30 or so years and the bed was horrible, you know the kind, if you tossed you feel every spring in your back, we should have found a store and bought a set of sheets to sleep on, the only thing missing from our experience were the bullet holes in the wall!

<Content>Not great for the money! My family and I stayed here for 3 nights in June of 2006. First, we were charged $18 a day for parking! That is ridiculous. Next, we were charged $2.00 for a small cup of coffee, which is also ridiculous. They told us we could go across the street and get it for $1.00. That showed how rude some of the staff were. Hallways smelled musty. In our room, the curtains were ripped and the paint was coming off the walls badly. The maids wouldn't even clean our room until after 3 pm. There weren't enough towels and it took them forever to bring any extra and when they did, the maid shoved the door open past my 9 year old daughter and dropped the towels on the bed. Spend a little more money and stay somewhere nicer. We like to take nice vacations and aren't afraid to spend money on rooms. If we would've spent just $20 more per night, we could've been in a much nicer place and been much happier. This was the last 3 nights of our 11 day vacation and we will never do that again. They made it sound much nicer than it actually was and we were so disappointed. Go elsewhere!

<Content>You can find better for the rate I stayed at this hotel in March with 3 of my girlfriends for a weekend Sobe trip. OK there were lots of problems at this hotel...First of all, the hotel was dirty. The hallways had old, dirty, moldy carpet that should've been removed years ago. And just as we thought it couldn't be any worse...Our room was ghetto, our electric outlet had no covering and nearly every appliance in our room didn't work. We had a tiny, old t.v. in our room that didn't even work and everytime we used the blowdryer, the fuse would blow and the electricity would go out. Our bathroom wasn't the cleanest either...our floor had weird debris behind the bathroom door. Who knows what it was....More problems....Getting into our room was annoying because our key cards didn't work half of the time soo we would have to constantly go down to the reception desk and have them activate them again. It gets worse...The pool was scary. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned for weeks.  I didn't expect a whole this2 1/2 star hotel which barely makes it to 2 star in my book to have the sam ammendities as a 3 star hotel, but it should atleast had working appliances. The only good thing about this hotel was its location. Its right near the beach and across the street from the SHORE CLUB, a really trendy nice hotel with an amazing pool and lounge. I don't recommend staying there for its price...you can find a nicer, cleaner hotel for the same rate. I would have given this hotel 2 star hotel an Ok, but some problems rating if itwasn't advertised as a 2.5 star hotel because its more like a motel.Don't waste your time here its not worth it.

<Content>Really enjoyed the stay I was really happy with the hotel for what we paid (average 拢40 a night). After reading the reviews on this website I was really quite worried about our stay here- we had nine nights booked, but I was pleasantly surprised. Admittedly the first room we were in had a leak in the bathroom but luckily we had only been in the room for 1 hr and they moved us to another room that was fine. The decor was not great (greens and pinks) but it was a nice spacious room with a fridge, safe, TV and air con that all worked fine and a nice, clean bathroom. I had some good nights sleep here, but my only advice would be to watch out for the weekends as the hotel seems to be popular with young people (I myself am only 23) and it was a bit noisy. The hotel pool seemed fine and there is a washer and dryer which were very handy for us.Overall I was extremely satisfied, for what we paid- we were on a tight budget- we had great quality and were in a great location. I would definitely stay here again if I was on the same budget (wouldn鈥檛 like to pay too much) and would recommend for both young and old- the hotel was fairly mixed which was nice.

<Content>I wouldn't suggest it I booked Dorchester under the advice of a travel agency (i haven't already discovered Trip Advisor). It has been very under my expectations (definitely don't believe the pics in the website - of course i'm always suspicious about them but this time the gap between photo and reality has been huge). The furnitures were old, the pool was renewing (actually they provided another in an hotel nearby) and the room was very small. Fortunately we booked it only for two days so we moved nearby to a much better hotel (Catalina) where we spent almost the same amount of money.If you are not picky it could be ok (the restroom was clean) but i think that at the same price you could find something better.

<Content>Don't stay here! My reservation was for two nights but after entering the lobby, I wanted to leave immediately. The hotel was dirty. The walls were dirty, the furntiure in my room had stains on them, the carpet needed to be replaced throughout the entire hotel. The kithchenette in my room was a joke. The pink formica countertops needed to be scrubbed down. The headboard wasn't even attached to my bed; it was leaning against the wall. The A/C unit was loud and kept me awake all night. This hotel has no concierge and no one to help with bags. There is only one elevator and you will have to wait 10 minutes for it to open. The only good thing about the hotel was the staff at the receptionist desk. They were very friendly and very helpful when I asked questions.

<Content>What are yall thinking? If it wasn't for the very friendly and informative staff, i would have left without even thinking twice! This hotel was by far the worse hotel i think i have 1 ever seen, 2 ever walked in, and 3 that i have ever had to sleep in! My God! Lets put it this way...if your a teenager on spring break, great have fun, cuz you probably wont remember it, but if you dont like to drink yourself into space, stay back! Do not look at pictures of the hotel from different websites because, trust me, it does not look like it at all! the room must have been 10 x 10, a small tv, very plain and paint missing walls, carpet destroyed (couldnt even walk barefoot), bathroom the size of a small car, etc. I apologize but i dont know where the rest of these people that left reviews stayed because it wasnt that hotel! Some positives are it is very close to shops, nightlife, restaurants and the beach, but there are plenty of hotels on the other side of the road! Good luck yall!

It was basic, but more than i had expected after reading the reviews before i went.The rooms were clean and always kept clean, the staff were great, and very chatty, and helped us alot when we asked where to go out...The pool was basic, but who wants to sit by the pool when you are in Miami?!I really cant say more than it was what you would expect, no flashiness, just a clean, and VERY pleasant and comfortable stay.About to book to go there again!

When I found I had no refrigerator I asked for one and received it within minutes.I cannot understand those who have given negative reviews. OK, this place is not the Delano ( $725 a night for the cheapest room), but for the price it is very fine.Loved the heated swimming pool.You pay more, you get more. Enjoy the Dorchester for what it is in a great part of South Beach.

<Content>very pleasent stay. My wife and I visited M.B. for a wedding, and I booked the Hotel. I was a bit concerned because of all the bad reviews, but I thought lets give it a shot, as most of the others similar were a bit out of our price range. I was very pleasantly surprised for what we paid. The lobby was nicely done in that art deco feel of old days, and it wasnt in bad shape as some reviews mentioned. Yes, this hotel is quite old, so you have to look at that also. The room was in an older state, but we were looking for a place to sleep, and change...nothing fancy, so it suited us. The only problem I had was that there was some mildewy smell in the room, and when I asked the nice man at the front desk if we could switch rooms, he basically asked us to pick any available room! Un fortunately, the ones available were on the main street, and it was a little to noisy. All we did was buy a scented candle and lit it everytime we were there. By day 2 of 6, no more odor..only vanilla! Overall, I would book it again.

<Content>not so dour at the Dorchester From the reviews of this hotel it seemed it was your worst nightmare. Actually it was quite pleasant. Everything worked as it should. The decor was old but clean. The refrigerator worked. The air conditioner put out lots of cold air but was a lttle loud when on high speed. The only fault was the small TV which had a poor picture. The bathroom was newly remodeled with a walk in shower - no tub.It was quiet and I would stay at the Dorchester again; make no mistake this is not a luxury hotel but is very functional in a plebian way

<Content>Dont ruin your vacation! awful disgusting unexceptable I would like to say that I have been traveling for the last 15 years staying in 15 to 45 hotels a year (over 500 lifetime). If traveling to a city for the second time usually a diffrent hotel each time. Anyway, I have never stayed in a worse establishment. I arrived to an older, 50's deco?, three story building. Not really knowing what to expect (first time to miami) it looked like the other hotels in the area so I was not concerned.I checked in to a non smoking room a and went up the elevator to the 3rd floor. Exiting the evlevator I notice some kind of petrolum smell, dirty stained hallway carpets and 7+ layers of paint on the walls. Tourning the hall corner I notice an old wall unit air conditioner which Im still not sure is causing the petrolum smell. I find my room open the door and smell the worst combined stench of stale smoke / humidity / and someones armpit.I have never felt the needs to switch rooms in my life, but there was no way I could spend my stay in that room. I went back to the desk and asked for another room which when I arrived at that one the air conditior did not work. Finally I settled on my third one which at least didnt smell and the air worked.Getting a little lengthy so I'll sum it up with this. We had 6 people from our company staying there and each person swithced rooms 2+ times. The room that I finally settled on had mold on the ceiling the tub and sink took approx 30 minutes to drain. My phone did not work. The TV controller vol. down button didnt work. The rooms lighting was terrible.I came back from work at 9:00 pm to an open door to my room. Apparently the maid who was there before noon had left it open. Unlocked for 9 hours. I asked the desk the next morning to ask the maid to please lock my room when she leaves and he told me that they have been having problems with that and there is really nothing he can do?????? The next day my parter comes to work and tells me that the maid went through all of his bags. Another one of my coworkers came to work with over a dozen bug bites on her lower body from something that was in the bed. And on the last day my air conditor broke which spewed hot humid air into my room all day long. I had to wash all my clothes even the still clean ones because they smelled so bad when I got home.One front desk girl was nice and it was in a good location for me half way between the ocean and the cnvention center, but there are tons of other choices in that area that have to be WAY better even if you have to pay double or even triple.I would sleep with the bums in the park through a hurricane before I would stay in that dump again. If you need more details feel free to email me.

<Content>Go elsewhere if at all possible! Had an unpleasant stay at this hotel. Stayed in the standard rooms (not suites) - maybe the suites are better but not these standard rooms. Carpets were old, dirty and sticky! Beds were uncomfortable (think halls of residence beds), bedsheets had old stains on them. Bathroom was small with no extractor fan or windows, so it was humid as hell. The air con had a methol/musky smell coming out of it and the smell stuck on my clothes and suitcases for days. But worst still.... if you used the sockets in the rooms.... it sparked!! With wires protruding through the walls. Hotel charged for EVERYTHING... including looking after your luggage (even for a couple of hours, after you've checked out), internet, the room safe and parking.The rooms were equivalent to 1* UK hotel.

<Content>Absolutely awful! I was in Miami Beach for a conference Sept. 24-28 and I had booked a room at the Dorchester mainly because I had read such positive reviews at this site. When I arrived, I was immediately uncomfortable. It struck me as the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour! The lobby was dimly lit, smelled of must and urine, had dirty lobby furniture, and the area used as a front desk looked as if it had been wiped down with a mud soaked cloth. walked into my room and was greeted by a huge stain in the middle of the carpet, odor of must/urine, and more dirty furniture. I picked up the phone to speak to the staff, and they were unable to hear me because the phone was broken. I could hear them, but they could not hear me. The only upside to the place was the bathroom, which looked as if it had been recently renovated, and belonged in a much better hotel. I didn't even set my bags down. I returned to the reception desk and immediately checked out. I was able to find a room at the Fountainbleau, which I highly recommend.

<Content>Won't stay here again When we arrived at the hotel around 1:30PM, we were told there was no early check-in and we'd have to wait until 3:00PM for check-in. Ok, that's reasonable, so we went to lunch. Arriving back at the hotel, we were told they didn't have a queen, which we reserved, but only 2 doubles. I really wanted a queen, so we were told we'd have to wait even longer. Around 4:00PM we were finally shown to our room. The air conditioning was not working at all in this room and it was unbearablly hot. When we complained, they said they had no other rooms available. After much arguing, they finally let us stay in the model they had available. It was on the street level and right on the street. There were no curtains in this room, only blinds which were broken in places. This meant people on the street could see right into the room, not a very secure feeling to say the least! We had to keep the bathroom door closed as the odor coming from the bathroom was intolerable. Overall, this was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a hotel. It was not a clean hotel, shabby and moldly smelling in the rooms and halls and the staff was not at all pleasant.

<Content>Great place, great price I was concerned about some the previous reviews I had read about the Dorchester Suites so I felt obligated to review it after my trip. The hotel is conveniently located across the street from the beach, a very short walk. You have easy access to the beach boardwalk and bricked pathway for morning walks. The suites are wonderful...large, well furnished. Everything was clean and the front desk responded quickly to our every need. Parking was $18 which was cheap for South Beach and you parked right at the hotel. Pool was very clean, warm and the poolside chaise lounges were the best I've ever seen. The price was unbelieveable for South Beach considering the size of the suite. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Never again Don't waste your time by staying there.It is small, has nothing and quite frankly is on the same level as a motel.Our tv didn't work properly, our phone didn't work properly. There was no kettle, so if you have a baby and need to heat up milk......you cant. No way of getting hot water after 11am. In the morning they charged 50cents just for a cup of hot water. No coffee making facilities. No public phone in the lobby. I'm not used to that. Dirty carpets. Sheets changed once every 3/4 days. They messed up our valet parking bill. They tried to make us pay for 5 days parking when we used it once and paid cash up front. Tried to charge us for the use of the safe. MAKE SURE YOU REALLY CHECK YOUR BILL WHEN YOU LEAVE. Rooms smell a little bit like pee due to the Air Conditioning. Use the stairs as the lift is very slow.The pool area is o.k. but very basic. Don't expect a jaccuzzi.The so called laundry room is not a room......It is OUTSIDE in the swelltering sunshine under some stairs. Nowhere to put the clothes as you fold them and as you'd assume everything is dusty from being outside. There is one washer and one dryer.The keys kept on not working so had to constantly go down to renew them.They asked for a deposit of $150 upfront...I'm used to giving them the credit card details just incase, but to actually have to pay them that in cash or on my card was unacceptable.I have stayed in 4 other hotels in Miami and this was the worst. I will never stay there again and for my fellows Brits a US 3star is nothing like a UK 3star....its more of a 1 to 2 star.I must say that some of the staff were quite helpful and it is not far from the action.

<Content>Dorchester a good deal in Miami Beach Myself and my two girlfriends stayed at the dorchester over spring break this year and were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were clean -average size. The hotel was nice and the location was great. The pool was small but clean. The staff ranged from very friendly to ok. Overall - we spent very little time in our room so it was a great place to sleep, get ready for the beach, change for dinner and going out and then sleep again. There are a million hotels in south beach and unless you are paying $300 a night they are all older hotels- I would definately stay at the dorchester again as it was clean, reasonably priced, great location and had an overall friendly and helpful staff.

<Content>cheap  For the price I thought this was great value for money, about 20 mins walk from all the action on ocean drive but great if you want an undisturbed nights sleep away from the music blasting away into the early hours like some of the other hotels nearer the centre. The room was spacious enough, cleaned every day, fresh towels etc, had an empty fridge great if you wanted to put your own drinks in to keep cold. There was a safe which they charged $1 per day. Hotel parking was $18 per day which was cheaper than the metered parking else where. Substantial buffet breakfast for $9. All in all I enjoyed my stay here and would certainly stay again.

<Content>ok but not great As per someone elses view the carpets were shabby shabby shabby, they had a scent. The top sheet on the beds are not changed when the room is relet. so it means we were induldging in someone elses sweat we had to request the change after noticing dried bits on the bedspread, however the sheets were changed everyday. The staff are nice and the breakfast was fine too. Is ok if you just need a room but not ok if you want to chillout in and watch telly all day. The hotel spacing was large and the bathroom was nice recently refurbished, this was the best feature.

<Content>Good Experience I stayed at the dorchester last month. Very nice. It is not the Taj Mahal but from what I witnessed not to many places in South beach are. Nice Lobby, nice room. Everything worked well. Nothing smelled bad or looked old. I was actually pleased. Because of the price I thought it would be awful but I was delightfully surprised. One negative. If you are from the ages of 20-30 and want to be in the middle of all the action then stay a little further downtown. Most of the action is below 14th street and the dorchester is on 19th so there is a little bit of a walk back to the place. All in all I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Not Bad I just returned from a weekend getaway at the Dorchester. It was a moderate hotel and offered exactly what it said it offered. Clean rooms, a pool, good location. Almost daily we walked to Ocean drive which was about a 20 min walk to get to the heart of Ocean Drive (between 11-5th streets) If you walk along the boardwalk that runs behind the hotels on the ocean, its wonderful.The hotel staff was great, specifically Viji and Adan. The airlines had lost my luggage so I was not in the greatest mood when checking in. Viji did her best to keep my spirits up. We walked down to Lincoln Road (about 4 blks from the hotel)for lunch while we waited for our room to be prepared.This is great place to people watch and eat. It is a pedestrian mall that offers a variety of food and shops. Our room was ready when we came back to the hotel. Its nothing fancy a basic room. We left again and upon our return we found our section of the hotel was without power. After a tearful request (due to lost/damage luggage issues etc) we were switched to a new room and upgraded to a junior suite at no charge. We did go over The Marseilles, their sister hotel, which is about 1.5 blocks down from the Dorchester to use their pool. Only drawback, not alot of room for chairs, so seating is very limited. Plan on spending money for drinks and food. I would also suggest you share at least lunch servings. Most places we ate at the serving sizes were large enough for 2. Drinks, unless you catch a special, are about $10 a drink. Also, most places include tax and gratiuty on the bills when presented to you. Would I go back again--probably not, but I usually do all inclusives and found I missed just being able to get food/drink whenever I wanted it without having to carry cash with me.. Admittedly I am spoiled by that type of service.If someone was looking to go to the South Beach area, and they wanted to be away from the heart of South Beach, this is the area for you..far enough away to enjoy the peace and calm but not too far to enjoy it if you choose.

<Content>will stay here again! i was nervous about staying here b/c of the few negative reviews i read on trip advisor, but my friends and i had a very good stay at the dorchester. whatever we needed: towels, pillows, blankets, etc. the staff provided quickly and politely. had no probs at the front desk checking in, no language barrier - not sure what one reviewer was complaining about. this is not one of those 4 star chain hotels so don't expect bliss bath products and 200 count sheets! BUT it is the perfect hotel if you're planning on spending most of your time on the town. the location is prime and the price is just right for an affordable stay in miami. i would definitely recommend this hotel for spring breakers, wmc-goers.

<Content>One of the worst hotels I've been to... Most of the rooms have a door (locked, of course) to adjacent rooms. This means that you hear practically everything that goes on in your neighbour's room. The staff wasn't particularly friendly, and cleaning personnel didn't do their work properly. Once when we forgot to tip, the cleaning lady had not made our beds and the morning 10-11am day she kept knocking on our door, even though we had a 'do not disturb'-sign on.. ..we didn't open the door, so the woman phoned our room...We were in this hotel for two weeks, and and that was enough, because the rooms were unpleasant, old (+ tv didn't work at times), the beds were uncomfortable. The bathroom was nice, though, and the pool. The smell of some kind of detergent was glued to our clothes and baggage after our stay, and at home we had to wash our clothes many times before it disappeared. I don't recommend this hotel for those who plan to stay longer (=over two days/nights).

<Content>Fantastic for Miami! Myself and my girlfriend have just returned from a week in Miami, where we stayed at the Dorchester.When we arrived late on Saturday evening, we were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel, and the very friendly staff we encountered when we were checking in. The staff were helpful all week - except one girl who seemed determined to sell us trips which we did not want to go on - the concierge service was very useful for a restaurant booking as well.The room was spacious, and although it didn't have coffee making facilities (there was a shop which made great coffee for $1 just left of the hotel!), everything else you wanted was there. The pool was sheltered from prying eyes, but was a suntrap, which was good!! One of the main benefits of staying in this hotel was the option to use the sister hotel, The Marseilles, bar, restaurant, pool and private beach. The Marseilles was situated about 1 block south of the Dorchester.The location of the Hotel is ideal for people who want to be just far enough away from the main hustle and bustle of Ocean Drive / Collins Avenue, as it is about 1 5 minute walk to Lincoln Road and the top of Ocean Drive. Because of this, it does mean that the hotel is quiet enough to be able to get some sleep after a night out!! Getting around town was made extremely easy as there was a bus stop directly outside the hotel, meaning that you could be in Dowtown Miami within 20 minutes or so, and heading off to do loads of other things than just lying on the beach!!We had originally been booked into the Catalina hotel, which looked like it was in a war-zone, and we are very glad we changed!! The price was tremendous, and overall this hotel was perfect for what we wanted, and tremendous value for money.I would definitnely recommend this hotel to people travelling to South Beach!!

<Content>Great location and rooms, terrible service My friends and I had our yearly reunion Oct 8-11, this year in Miami. We picked the Dorchester Suites because we got 1 Br, full living room, dining room, and kitchenette (toaster, microwave, fridge, burners, dishes, but no oven) for half the cost of a regular hotel room at the fancy hotels across the street. The rooms were in great condition and had plenty of room for 4 people. The A/C worked great. They were located in a quiet courtyard with fountains. The pool was good. The hotel has the ideal location - directly across the street from the expensive hotels (National, Delano), the beach, 2 blocks from Lincoln Street Promenade (restaurants and shops) and many clubs. The downside to this hotel is the service. The lines for the front desk took forever. We weren't given both rooms with 2 doubles as requested, but the hotel provided two free cots in the king bed room. The parking sold out because they didn't tell us to reserve it at check-in and then they tried to charge us for it on checkout. One day we had the do not disturb sign on in the morning and the cleaning people never returned to clean the room at all. Another day they cleaned it and took away all the towels! Calling the front desk to get extra utensils for cooking, etc was useless. Many other people were stuck at the front desk with all kinds of problems. This hotel is great if you are a group of young people looking for a great location, clean room, and reasonable rates. Don't expect anything in the service department.

<Content>Better than expected The pictures available in the Internet are not exactly what you find there. However, it is well located, fair price, clean. They can enhance the quality of the bedclothes and pillows. Additional fees are parking (USD 10) and safe (USD 1). The only thing that I consider bad was the shower, which we have to waste long time because the water flow is very, very weak. I recommend, and I would stay there again.

<Content>An Average Guy's Honest Review Disregard all the One Star reviews. This place is CLEAN, AFFORDABLE,  GOOD SERVICE. If you're not some sort of prissy this is a good value for the price. We rented to rooms, one was nicer and newer than another. But there we're no bugs, no broken anything, and it looks like the website photos. If you can't afford something posh, this is great.Only problems: there is no bar by the pool and the elevator was slow. It's only 3 stories at most, take the stairs.

<Content>My best stay in South Beach This is the best hotel I have lodged in South beach in Miami.I am not talking about hi-end hotels, I am of those kind of travelers that cares about staying at good hotel while reserving my bucks to spend them in other activities.Have been in half dozen hotels in this same area and this is the best room I have gotten.King Size Bedroom, Kitchennete with microwave, stove and refrigerator, lounge with TV and Stereo Radio.. dining table....Huge!I have to be honest, I got a free upgrade in the week prior labor day. But at least I can say that there are not bad surprises. Clean, Pool, Nice, good service, caring employees and great location.Only thing you have to know is that parking is limited and is worth $12 per night, neares public parking is $20 for same $12 hours and coin parking is worth $1 per hour. I just love it.Ramon Duran

<Content>Liked the Dorchester Stayed @ the Dorchester on 19th  Collins over July 4th week-end. Good location, nice sized rooms...tho it did smell a little moldy/smoky, bring a candle...the pool was great to soak in after spending the day on the beach...the little fridge in the room was a great way to keep drinks cold...I think they have a free breakfeast buffet but I never got up early enough to try it :) I would stay there again.

<Content>Quite but still close to action I stayed here for a week and found the suites very nice, especially for its price.All the appliances were new and kitchen area exceptional.I would recommend this hotel to a friend. Did not get a chance to see the hotel rooms connected to it though. The pool is heated and wonderful to go in on a late night swim. If your looking to be in the middle of all the action I would not recommend this hotel. It is a good 3 blocks from the clubs. Nice distance to the shops though. But it took us a few times to call the staff to clean.

<Content>Horrible!!! The service was terrible. No bellman, had to carry my bag up two flights of stairs. The bathroom lock was broken, so we were locked out of the bathroom for a bit. The phoneand the safe didn't work. Which they tried to charge us for in the end. The towels will rub the skin from your body and the noise is unbearable. The front desk not helpful. The key for our room needed to be reset at least six times. Everytime we got to our door the key wouldn't work and we would have to walk back to the front desk. The only positive thing is the Suite itself was okay.

<Content>Great welcome for an English woman travelling alone! The trip was booked through Trailfinders. A single room was request for 2 weeks. Stayed 22 May 2004 to 6 June 2004The hotel reception was clean and the reception staff were very welcoming. Note - 拢150 deposit is needed. A single room was not free when I checked in after 5pm so I was given a One Bedroom Suite Room 150.The suite was excellent, large lounge with t.v and stereo system (CD did not work) dining room, standard size kitchen with double hob, fridge and toaster (didn't work) lots of storage space.Clean good size bathroom!The bedroom was great large king size bed, plenty of closet space. The only down side to this bedroom was that the window was next to the rubbish dumping area so it can be a little noise first thing in the morning other then that it was fine.I had this room for five days. As it was Memorial weekend and quite busy I was told that I needed to move to the room that had been paid for within the hotel. The suites are at the back of the hotel by the Pool.They helped move all my belongings (and there was a lot)The first room that they attempted to put me in was awful the drapes were ripped and there was an awful smell in the room (205) and the bed looked very uncomfortable. The friendly porter noted my disgust and moved me to the next room 206, this was better but the drapes would not close this was needed as the room had three very large windows.The room was on the second floor and the windows faced the Collins Avenue - the view was great!The drapes were fixed imediately and I was happy!The bathroom was very clean - recently fitted.There was a small fridge, sink and food storage places. Queen size bed with a small closet (with safe) and TV and radio (both worked).The rooms were cleaned on a regular basis.There is a small workout room (treadmill and two weights machines) Decent size poolWashing machine and dryer - Dryer did not work but housekeeping did all the drying for me.Overall the hotel was good the staff very friendly (well most of them)If you are going for a relaxing chill out holiday stay in the suites as it can be very noisy in the rooms at the front of the hotel - Especially Memorial Weekend when the music/noise does not stop from Thursday to Tuesday.If you are looking for somewhere to get you head down after clubbing then this is the place for you!I hope this helps xx

<Content>NASTY!!!! ok. where do i start? gross, gross, gross. i stayed at this dump on may6-9. i was in town for a wedding so i was trying to keep costs down. first off the roons were hideous!!! picture bright green blankets with green curtains to match. now add a musky smelly funk to the room, that doesn't go away even with the a/c on. i have no complaints with the bathroom. it was newly renovated and clean but small.  but back to the room. on our last night there we discovered these 2 little maggots on our bed!!!!! EWWW then we found all these pairs of insect wings on the a/c unit. thank god we were leaviing the next morning.check out was easy. no hassles.....oh and one thing... if you do stay at this hotel, make sure you check your luggage when you get home. WE FOUND MORE OF THOSE MAGGOTS IN OUR BAGS!!!!!! bottom line...this hotel is NASTY!!!

<Content>Great time at the Dorchester We arrived here to be pleasantly surprised considering how cheap the room was! As 4 girls we found the room to be large enough for all of our cases,clothes, products and shopping etc and the bathroom facilities enough to make us happy! ie big shower,constant hot water,hairdryer,LARGE mirror!!The situation of the hotel was perfect, close enough to explore south beath, the bus stop right outside and a perfect location for people watching!The swimming pool was clean and big enough to have a swim...only complaint not enough sun beds so get up early and be prepared!The staff were lovely and very accomodating especially the night staff!!!
