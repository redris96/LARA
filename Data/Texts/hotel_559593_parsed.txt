<Content>Excellent Boutique Apartments Bit of delay putting my review on but I have been going through my old holiday snaps and thought this place deserves a review.I loved the white furtiture in the Junior Suite and the wall parting between the living area and the bedroom.The bath was off the wall where you step down into a huge square shaped space. Wierd. Tha staff were friendly and the restuarant looked although we didnt eat there.I booked it direct from the website and they arranged flowers for my girlfriend because it was her birthday. The flowers were fablulous. The apartment is situated near the trendy Mitte area and there are some very nice restuarants around.We would definately go back to Berlin and the Lux - very nice apartment in a very nice trendy city

<Content>Decent design hotel - bit too sparse Stayed at the Lux as part of a group booking for friends attending a launch party in the City. The hotel staff were great, the breakfast is a good buffet with delicious croissants. The beds are not true king size but are ok for a couple and perfecly comfortable. Very design magazine looking room but white walls inevitable get scuffed.The bathroom is a design feature which I personally wouldn't choose, but the shower is great, loads of pressure and aboth overhead and handheld. It is open to the room but unlike other reviewers I think if you have issues with your partner seeing you in the shower thats your problem not the hotel.Location is good, Mitte is a great hub to get to everything, there is a U-Bahn and S-Bahn within a couple of minutes walk, and the best boutique shops are just round the corner. No cleaning daily but towels changed which is fine.Overall good for a weekend stay but wouldn't pay their rack rates.

<Content>What a beautiful place to go i was a bit concerned about the different ratings in this blog. some likeed it, some liked it not. however, so the question was: how will it be for me? i booked the hotel directly on the hotels webpage. got a good price (225 euros per night) and was very surprised! surpriced positivly!!! what a nice and beautiful place to go. very stylish decorated, beautiful looking and utmost freindly staff. outstanding service, brilliant breakfast - in total: i can not understand if somebody is dissapointed with this place. we've had free internet with our special hotel rate, we've got aircon in the room, we've got roomservice, however - we got anything to fullfill our expectations and needs about the place. location is excellent and not to beat and we will return for sure. just one think which should pointed out: i've never seen in any other place or hotel so many nice and beautiful young and stylish guest as in the lux. you have the feeling you are in a model agency for a casting when you enter the bar or the breakfast room or entering the hotel floors! so beautiful... we loved it!!!

<Content>Aweful service, overpriced, bad mangement and disappointing rooms First I have to say: we love boutique hotels, booked them all over the world and do not mind to pay the usually a bit steeper price for nice rooms. But staying at the Lux 11 for three nights was one of the most disappointing stays we ever had.The service was very poor to say the least, arriving we were treated more as annoying invaders rather than greeted as guests. Fhe first appointed room was not their standard square room in this category, but a corner room, that way the actual usage space of the room was tiny, no space even to put one bigger suitcase. After complaining we learned that all the other rooms in this category were booked out. We were only offered higher category rooms, for a much higher price. The prices were even much higher than the price we would have paid on the website through which we booked our room. Pointing that out to the front desk manager we were told that he cannot give us the room for that website price, since they will sell these rooms anyway for the high price. Eventually they downgraded us to the lowest category room. That room was still a bit bigger than the corner room in our booked higher category, but still was tiny, tiny, tiny. It was facing the street, even though the hotel advertises its windows as sound proof, they are not. The noise of the traffic will wake you up very early in the morning. Within three nights, we never did not get our normal category room. On top of it the personal was very rude not only to us, but to a biz partner who called in and afterwards he was connected to the wrong room. All together the rooms are not really stylish, just trying hard and even more tiny than we experienced in Tokyo or Hong Kong island and totally overpriced. The bigger rooms are ok, but even more overpriced (starting from around 300 US Dollar without breakfast). The internet charge is 40 Euros per day, about 60 US dollar.The service is poorly to say the least, up to being rude. Apparently we were not the only ones making this bad experience his was the first hotel were the management decided to downgrade us, after figuring out they do not have a decent room in the booked category - even though they had other rooms available. Our advice: Do not book Lux 11 it really spoiled our stay in Berlin! ..

<Content>Disapponted Booked the hotel for two nights to celebrate a part of our honeymoon. We read about the hotel in Wallpaper guide.We ended up leaving one day too early as we were so disappointed about the rooms and especially the service.Service: BAD!!!- We had to ask several times to receive a confirmation of our booking- There was no more parking spaces left for our car and they dont have valet parking. Thus, we had do drive to a near by hotel to park our car-We called to ask if it we could cancel our room for the second day and was told it would not be a problem. When we then checked the day after they wanted us to pay for the second night despite what they informed us the day before. After a long argument they agreed to cancel without penalty as promised.Rooms: Do not live up the the price-Nice design, spacey, nice colors-Shower/tub in same room next to bed (guess some people like that)-No minibar-Small kitchen if ones wants to cook-Beds short (if you are over 190cm tall your legs will stick out)All in all very poor hotel considering the price they are asking.Second day we switched to Bradenburger Hof, which was fantastic and at about the same priceWill never be back.

<Content>Great Location - Average Room Location perfect for walking Berlin. Lots of cool shops and restaurants in Berlin Mitte - Loved Oliv Coffee/Breakfast Bar (around the corner from hotel) and Dolores Burrito Bar (tasty and fun) just down street from hotel. Hotel麓s restaurant Shiro i Shiro was almost too hip. Very loud and tight. Sushi starter was good, entree was average crossover creative something-or-other. Room was light and clean, functional - a bit too much IKEA. Amazingly quiet for street side. Kitchenette was stocked with utensils, glasses, etc. and there are lots of markets nearby for supplies. Perhaps it麓s my age or prudeness but the open bathroom concept was a bit unsettling - even after years of marriage there are certain bathroom things that shouldn麓t be shared. The toilet itself is separate from the room - just the shower, sink and vanity are integrated in the sleeping space. Interesting to look at but strange to share.....Hotel staff was nice. Was a bit put off by the hotel limosine service offered. Taxi to Hauptbahnof is 10 euros with tip. Hotel limosine surprised us with 20 euro fee. Nice driver, though.For big style and great location, check out Hotel de Rome (lovely! Will stay here next time!) or the Sofitel am Gendarmmarkt. Can book super deals for only a bit more than Lux 11. Hotel am Hackishenmarkt also looked good - charming. Hotels on Potsdamerplatz are impressive but location is too far out. Would be good location for musicals, even checkpoint charlie but for Mitte (and the great scene in mitte) Potsdamerplatz is not convenient. Be happy!

<Content>Apart-hotels are the way forward.... We stayed in the Lux for our anniversary and loved every minute of it. No maids fussing over you all the time, disturbing your restful sleep after a very late night/early morning out in Berlin. No one coming and tidying up your room whilst you're out so it feels more like your room (the bed wasn't changed in the three days we stayed, but who changes their bed at home every three days?). As other reviews have stated, if you like room service, don't stay here. But if you like getting away and feeling like the room you have is your own then this is perfect.Nicely designed without being over the top and therefore dating quickly. We had a massive room with kitchenette and walk in bath. The hotel is perfectly located for the former East berlin and all it's funky districts and sights and it's not that far to walk to the Brandenburg gate and on into the west. The restaurant attached does great fusion food and the whole experience converted me to the apart-hotel concept. Highly recommend

<Content>Designer hotel in Mitte which could be beat but OK. Cool design hotel which is more of an apartment place. Each room has a kitchenette. They are more hotel rooms though than apartments. All very stylish and modern. Staff is nice but as some wrote a bit overwhelmed at times. Location is the best part about this place. Perfect if you are staying in Mitte. It's not cheap but if you shop around you can find better than most people quote (120 Euro a night). What I didn't like was that the floor in the room wasn't much different from a jail cell (don't ask). Hard, cold cement just painted with some light blue color. Not my thing....I like carpets. Further, the shower in my room was really cool but not designed well. I managed to get a nice area of the room wet when showering. Finally, the cleaning every three days is kinda weird at this price point. Still definately a good place if you're looking to stay in the area. There is much cheaper to be had with fairly good quality.

<Content>very nice vacation in berlin and in the Lux 11 I have visited the apartment house Lux 11 in Sep. 2007, one month ago. On my arrival day I realized that the hotel is not very easy to find for a person who has not been in the city befor. On the outside of the hotel are no signes which show you that you are at the right place. But when I entered the entrance of the hotel I was quiet impressed, the entrance was very colorfull and the staff welcomed me with a big smile on their faces. I felt very comfortable in the atmospere of the Lux 11. The staff made a very friendly and relaxed impression on me. The apartments are stylish and cleand well. On my second day of vacation I started with a brekfast in the restaurant of the hotel. There I got the chance to choose between a large variety of food and drinks. I was able to produce my own waffles and my own orange juice, for exampel. When I had finished my breafast I decided to look arund, to get a better picture of the area. I麓ve visited lots of famous buildings, museums and stores, which were all easy to reach by bus or train. All in all I can say that I had a very nice vacation in Berlin and in the Lux 11. The friendly atmosphere helped me to feel comfortable in the hotel and I can say that I would recomment the hotel to everyone who want麓s to have a pleasent stay in Berlin. If you want to get an impression of the hotel by yourself it might be helpful to take a look at the website [---] because there you can find a very detailed description of the hotel with lots of pictures. Enjoy your vacation as much as I have done!

<Content>Great location -- untrained staff Cute designhotel located in Mitte, where things are happening at the moment in Berlin. The rooms are sweet and calm, and if you have a room to the backside you'll have a spacious balcony.Unfortunately the hotel has a very untrained staff that sometimes is unpolite and very inattentiv when there is a high pressure.I recommend it because of the location and that it's new and fresh, but not for a longer stay.I would also recommend to eat breakfast in some of the caf茅s in the area. Berlin is famous for it's nice breakfast and the hotel charge you 10鈧?per person for a very poor one with machine made coffee.For that price you get pancakes with fresh fruit and a freshly made cafe latte just around the corner. Don't use internet at the hotel, it's free at most caf茅s and the hotel charge 4鈧?an hour.

<Content>Not for the summer! In most respects this is a very good hotel with generally well equipped, good size rooms and great location. But had to mark this down since the rooms have no air-con - this is not made clear ( should be for a hotel of this standard), and results in the hotel being quite uncomfortable to stay during hot weather.

<Content>A great stay! We had a great stay at the Lux 11. We chose an executive suite which is highly recommended as it gives quite a lot more space than the other apartments for not much more money. The whole building is very stylish but very relaxed. The location is great near to lots of good shopping, bars and restaurants.The staff were fantastic, very helpful. Very surprised by the negative comments about them.The only reasons I would not give an excellent rating is because there were some failings. The sink in the room looked amazing but only served up very hot water. Yes, it is an apartment but to not service the room for 3 days is awkward. The floors are painted light green so quickly get really dirty, the bin is small and so fills up (with no where to empty it downstairs/outside) etc.. I think if they were to consider a light clean every day and then change bedding every 3. Also not being able to buy simple stuff like water/wine in the hotel seems bizarre when there is a restaurant on the ground floor. There are a lot of rooms, surely a simple delivery service would make them money!

<Content>Great time in Berlin We had a fine 4 day stay ended with our departure this morning.We enjoyed the Lux very much. The room was very comfortable and attractively styled. The locatiln was superb. Wowever, what really made our stay so pleasant was the helpful and friendly attitude of the staff. We would be happy to recommend the house to our friends, the athmosphere is great, the kitchenette and the cleaning every third day make you feel like beeing home. This is what I expected when I booked an Apartmenthouse and not a hotel, it was so much fun.I also would recommend the Lux for business people, because it is so close to the center and you have a desk in every room.

<Content>Cool design, but not for the business traveller I was in Berlin on business, so stayed a night in the Lux 11 hotel. The hotel had been recommended to me by our German colleagues and from the website I was really looking forward to my stay.The location is excellent if you wish to explore everything that Berlin has to offer. However, I was here on business and just wanted a comfortable bed for the night, as I had an early start.The hotel looks incredibly stylish from the outside, and the rooms are also deliciously style conscious. The simple, sleek and elegant feel and look to the rooms makes them feel quite homely despite the lack of colour.The only drawback for me is that the hotel is geared towards the trendy traveller, rather than the functional business traveller. I arrived after the reception had closed, and the process of obtaining my room key was far from simple - I had to go to the restaurant and phone through my credit card details.The room is nice, but as I've said, not for the business traveller. I couldn't get an internet connection for my laptop and there was no room service - things that I'm sure the average tourist can live without.Breakfast on a morning is divine - although not included. It's definitely worth waking up for!Overall, a nice hotel in a good location that caters to its target market of the casual, style-conscious traveller.

The location is magnificent for anyone wishing to see Berlin: for museum and cultural events as well as for shopping.It is a design hotel: we liked the furniture/decoration and the overall hotel ambience.We liked the whole residence thing: not having cleaning ladies bagging to your door every day - waking you up.There was no noise at all. It was pleasently warm. Staff was very efficient.Value for money.We had a very good stay.

<Content>coolest place you can go... Most boutique hotels aim to create an immersive and theatrical experience, one that the low-maintenance traveler may find slightly overbearing. If you鈥檙e the type that depends on the hotel bar for your entertainment and the hotel staff for your every need, then Lux 11 may feel a bit sparse. But for guests who know their way around Berlin Mitte, and simply need someplace stylish to lay their heads, this could be just the thing. Lux 11 is nominally an apartment hotel, meaning it鈥檚 light on services and heavy on independence. The front desk closes at 10 on weeknights and 5 on weekends, and maid service comes along just every couple of days 鈥?it sounds like corner-cutting, but the result is that guests very quickly begin to feel like residents. And for a residence you could do quite a bit worse. These rooms are cleverly laid out to feel much larger than they are, and feature well-equipped kitchenettes and luxurious modern bathrooms, and space-saving touches like wall-mounted flat-screen televisions. White-on-white rarely looked so good 鈥?you鈥檒l quickly remember why monochrome became the default boutique hotel color scheme. Downstairs the Aveda spa and the Italian/Asian restaurant will see to all your corporeal needs. The main attraction, however, lies outside: the Mitte district is one of Berlin鈥檚 hottest neighborhoods, home to an endless array of galleries, shops and restaurants as well as a sizable proportion of the city鈥檚 media and design sectors.

Small room, cold atmosphere and a pretentious design without means for that. I don't understand why such a place is recommended by some of the prestigious traveller magazines.

<Content>Great Location for the Hackersher Market Got a great deal through American Express. Hotel very modern and trendy. Bathroom arrangement not for the shy! Great for young couples how want privacy as their is little in the way of hotel ammenities. Suited us fine as I hate loads of fussing. Reinherts restaurant is gorgeous and not too far to walk but you need to book in advance. Didn't try hotel restaurant as it looked very bright and looked full of people who adored themselves. Mitte is the only place to stay. The television tower gets huge queues( you will queue inside also for an eternity). We went for opening and had breakfast which was really great. I would stay here again although it isn't terribly cosy and some may think a little stark. For the price we paid 225 Euro for 3 nights in a junior suite if was fabulous!!!!!!

<Content>Perfect Location w/ Small Compromises Had a fantastic 4-day stay at Lux 11. It's the absolute perfect location for anyone who wants to be in the center of Berlin's burgeoning creative scene. You'll be surrounded by high-style boutiques, hip restaurants, and cool nightclubs. Also near many U-Bahn and S-Bahn stops, so it's easy to get to all corners of the city. And the building is former housing for the secret police...a little bit of East Berlin history to add to the place's mystique.I have read most of the reviews here and think the people who hated it had the wrong expectations. One thing should be made very clear: this is not a 4-star hotel that will cater to your every need. There is no room service, no concierge, no minibar, and bed turndown/room cleaning is done every third day. Sounds odd for a hotel, but because these rooms are more like small apartments, it seems to work. You get a rather chic, fully stocked little kitchenette (all the tools you need to prepare a dinner for 4) and a good DVD/CD player. It's kinda like being home.Also, this is not the place to stay if you're sharing a room with friends or coworkers...or if you're shy. There is very little separating the shower and the bedroom (just a step up and a clear glass divider). Again, sounds odd, but I found the use of space and overall design to be artful and ingeneous.I was there during moderate weather in August, so air conditioning was not an issue. I found the rooms to be airy, light-filled (very high ceilings with lots of large windows), quiet, and extremely comfortable (great bed). When you do need maintenance of some sort, they are fast and efficient. When we arrived, there was a small problem with the window (not shutting all the way and letting in some street noise). The problem was fixed within 10 minutes and the room became silent (and we were on the first floor right above the street). It's a very solid building.Long story short: for the independent, unfussy, style-conscious traveler, Lux 11 is an excellent and affordable choice. Just know what to expect.

<Content>Hip, cool, conceptual, no air con, unconventional This is a very stylish hotel with a cool restaurant. Great location.I really enjoyed it, but would probably chose a different hotel for a short trip.The staff is young, German and hip. So don't expect stiff service.The room is stylish, some designs are useless though ( I nearly broke my arm every time I used the sink - you'll have to experience to understand this comment).It is an appartment hotel and you will get a good price if you stay more than just a few days. I don't understand the kitchen concept in there. No Air con - for americans not familiar with European hotels - better not come here.Also I like my bed being made daily when I am on a short culture trip.So in all a little overdesigned, the appartment concept will soon be abandoned I guess. But it is a great place - it just fits the location: Berlin is young, improvising, experimental, relaxed, European, unconventional, multiculti, so utterly cool - same is the LUX

<Content>Great Hotel, Perfect Location! My husband and I stayed at the Lux 11 for five nights (13 Aug through 18 Aug) and thought it was a great little hotel. We booked a junior suite with a view of the TV tower and loved looking down on the city streets at night. The rooms are not like those of your typical hotel...there is a lot of concrete (floors, sinks, shower, counter tops) and a very large rainshower that's right in the bedroom area and separated only by a glass wall. The furniture is modern but very comfortable ... especially the king size bed! Maid service is every three days, unless you request it daily and pay an additional daily charge. It is definitely a modern, hip establishment geared toward a younger clientele, but it was a lot of fun even for old folks like us. Our room was very clean, and the staff members (all of whom looked like very well groomed college kids) were extremely friendly, always smiling and very helpful in advising us how to get places, where a good internet cafe was, where the closest bank machine was, etc. (TIP: Make sure you say bank machine and not ATM...ATM just drew looks of confusion.) Contrary to what others have said, I think the staff at the Lux 11 were exceptional. The location of the hotel was perfect...just a five minute walk from both Alexanderplatz and Hackeschoffer Hoff and surrounded by tons of restaurants, cafes and shops. If you want to stay at a traditional hotel that could be transplated in any city around the world without noticing a difference, don't stay at the Lux 11. If you want to stay somewhere really unique that encompasses the vibrancy of the rapidly changing eastern section of Berlin, then the Lux 11 is for you. We had a great time during our stay at the Lux 11 and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Awful Experience This was supposed to me the first stop on a 3-leg European trip. As soon as I arrived I knew things were not going to go as planned. The front desk person informed me that there would be no towel or maid service and after checking into the room, I noticed there was no airconditioning--making the room unbearibly hot. There were also mildew stains on the uncomfortable concrete tub and the room was anything but warm and inviting. This place is a joke--I can't imagine anyone finding it alluring. The staff is unprofessional and unfriendly--the place has the charm of a prison. Within 5 minutes, I asked to check out. The front desk person pleaded with me to stay, but leaving was one of the smartest decisions I've ever made. Checked into the Westin--stayed in one of their brand new spa suites--and had one of the best stays of my life.

<Content>Perfect Stay We spent a whole week in this extravagant place and decided to book a junior suite for 165,00 EUR. Having been a guest in some other fine Berlin designhotels, I must say this one is by far the best.The staff is very, very professionel and catering to every need on request, and absolutely friendly. No matter whom you will meet, the bellboy, the ladies from the housekeeping or a manager everyone will wish you a good day. And it seemed to me, they really meant it - that was not just the result of good training. Everybody is rushing arround with a smile.... we like that very well and really felt home.The room was spacious, nicely decorated with a rooms-smell called callas, the bed perfect, two different choices shower-amenities (one for ladies and one for gentlemen). we've had a large flatscreen tv with a dvd player and we enjoyed our own cds when beeing in the room and no boring hotelradio or similar.The location is convenient and very hip: at the Hacksche Hoefe, directly in the mitte district. you can rush out of the hotel and you are immedialty in teh center of the hippest and coolest district of berlin.I can highly recommend this hotel! and, however, i've never seen so much beautiful, young and good looking people (all guest) in any other place i've been before. everybody is ultrastylish and look like models, actors and celebrities...

<Content>NOT recommended - unfriendly and arrogant despite its hip surroundings and interior, lux 11 is not a place to recommend. problems started with a phone call enquiry where i was simply referred to the website for all information - the guy on the phone repeatedly referred me to the website with each question i asked. then there was a misquote on the price - a substantial sum but given lack of availability we had to take it. front desk staff were clearly annoyed with having to field innocent enquiries, did not make for a pleasant atmosphere. staff let themselves into the room late at night while room was occupied. then at check out there was an extended delay as they claimed we had not paid , which we had done so in advance. on discovering that we had we were offered no apology. NOT recommended! for the standard they boast, you are better off staying in a lesser star establishment where you will get better service. dont go there.
