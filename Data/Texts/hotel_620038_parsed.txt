<Content>No way Jose! We ended up booking a one week stay with this hotel in Madrid, after reviewing comments on tripadvisor.com. Little I knew at that time (soon I would come to regret it), as it slipped me that there is a hotel with a similar name in New York (USA) that apparently has great reviews and people that stay there post on this one from Spain - hence the high rating for this MADRID (Spain) one.To carry on, except for the great location, right next to the Royal Palace and literally steps from the Opera and Opera metro stop, there is nothing nice about this hotel: room sucks, breakfast sucks, maybe service doesn't that much - but then again after a sleepless night in a horrid heat and no air conditioning and no way to fix it for one week, then yeah, service sucks too.Rooms looked quite interesting in photos, but once on the ground, well, they're just not: very small and noisy, you can hear everybody, doing anything - and I don't mean that funny stuff you just thought about. As for the decorations, the glamor from the photos is lost, as the nice painted walls just look fade and colorless. The bathroom is actually just a small closet, fitted with a shower cabin and toilet - it had the smallest sink I ever saw and the economic shower head, that pumps water under pressure, great on the environment but absolutely dreadful when it comes to taking a proper shower in less then 30 minutes.Breakfast was not that bad, so that's a plus. However, being located next to the breakfast area meant we invariably had to wake up when the first guests arrived for breakfast - don't ask about the Don't disturb sign, is just that, a sign.I guess we just clinched our teeth and did not leave earlier because we just did not want to let this ruin our beautiful experience in Madrid. Guess that will not happen next time, because there will not be a next stay at this hotel.Adios!

<Content>Excellent NYE base! Really couldn't find fault with this hotel. Excellent location by the Palace and opera, spotlessly clean, modern design and helpful staff. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty too.My partner and I stayed at Mario over the New Year and found it an excellent base - it was only a couple of hundred metres from the main celebrations!Only minor gripe is noise at night from the street, but this isn't the hotel's fault and is to be expected in such a central location. Would definitely try another of the hotel's branches in future.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Helpful friendly staff Just returned from a stay at the Room Mate Mario. This is a lovely hotel with great staff. The buffet breakfast was lovely and it was open till 12 - (which is unusual), which was great for us as we like our lie-in in the mornings - and not having to be up and at breakfast for 10 was a nice extra.On the downside - even though the rooms were nice, they were abit noisy - everytime a toilet flushed above or in the next room it could be heard.Overall it was a lovely hotel and I very much enjoyed the stay

<Content>In one word: EXCELLENT True: the rooms are tiny, but I think that is the case in every hotel in Manhattan. Every space is optimised. The personnel is very friendly, the breakfast is excellent, the hammam and swimmingpool a warm welcome after all those hours off visiting and walking, the dj is good, the ambiance is relaxed, the hotel kiosk very well equiped (from a dog leash to lubrifant gel!) but most of all, it is only a few feet from Times Square.We had a wonderful stay, and we will tell all our friends of this great hotel.THANK YOU

<Content>Awesome Breakfast and Great Staff I have stayed at the Room Mate at Malaga before; my friends and I loved it so I am pleased to say we made a good choice to stay at another RM this time at Madrid!  This hotel has a great location, very close to the Palacio Real, Gran Via, Plaza De La Puerta Del Sol, Plaza Mayor, and multiple metro stations. We love the breakfast that is included in the rate. It has a great selection: bread/pastry, cereal, fresh fruits, ham/turkey/cheese, all different kinds of juices, tea and an awesome coffee machine. We had the unfortunate event of losing our luggage during our transfer and the staff has been very very helpful in calling the airlines for us for multiple days. They were all very pleasant and professional. One last note, the free internet at the lobby is also a plus when most hotel would charge you like 鈧? for a card for an hour access. I will definitely stay at another RM hotel during my future Spain trip as they have multiple locations at various cities.

<Content>Couldn't Have Been Any Better Hotel Grace is simply the BEST! My fiance and I went to NYC for a romantic pre-holiday weekend getaway. We wanted to imerse ourselves into the city at the holidays. Hotel Grace was the perfect place to do that! We were centrally located to everything. The hotel was super cool with a European feel. The rooms were very comfortable. The staff was very cordial and accomodating. The rates were EXCEPTIONALLY fair, especially for the weekend before the holidays (typically the most popular time of year in the city). We travel quite a bit and have been in hotels around the world. This hotel is a great find, especially considering it is in the heart of NYC. We are going to go back to the city in either the spring or fall, and will be returning to Hotel Grace.

<Content>A bit disappointed My wife and I recently spent our honeymoon at Grace in NYC. I had been in correspondence with a rep from the hotel prior to our stay. I had inquired about having a bottle of champagne on ice, rose pedals on the bed as well as candles lit throughout the room. She told me there would be an extra fee (which was NO problem). She told me she would inquire with a local florist and find out a price. I never heard back from her. A few days before we left for NYC I sent another email as a reminder. Still no reply. When we arrived, the kiosk acknowledged it was our honeymoon (So i thought things were on track) However, when we entered our room....it looked just as every other room did in the entire hotel. I felt very disappointed because I got in contact with the Grace hotel with ample time to effectively accomplish my requests. Unfortunately, my expectations weren't met.

<Content>Nice but over-rated Took a shine to Mario when I saw the pictures on its official website; the rooms looked incredibly stylish. Truth was while the hotel lobby was very chic and decked out in designer furnishings, the room we stayed in was less than impressive. Firstly, it was way smaller than we had expected, especially the bathroom or should I say shower-area? It was literally that; a shower space in a glass case right next to the toilet seat. The basin was situated out of the bathroom because there just wasn't any space!Add to that, the water in the shower just would not drain! So if you keep the shower turned on, you'll soon be flooded. Plus, water was flowing out through the glass door which wasn't properly built to shut. At the end of it all, there was water on the floor outside the shower which in turn soaked through the bathmat/towel meant to dry your feet and keep them toasty after a hot shower.Next came the beddings. I found strands of hair on the white sheets! Unacceptable for a mid-range hotel that prides itself on being a designer-boutique brandname.The only saving grace was the very helpful assistance we received from one of the staff, Guido. We needed directions to get to a shopping outlet located outside of Madrid. Guido spent more than 20mins giving us detailed directions, pointing out the Metro stops on the map, checking the exact address of the outlet on the internet and providing personal recommendations. Definitely went beyond his call of duty! Thank you Guido.Overall, while the hotel experience was mediocre, its location was good; you're less than a minute's walk away from the Metro (Opera) and about 15mins walk from the major shopping belt; Gran Via. There is also the lovely Teatro Real right next door. Other than that, Mario should seriously consider looking into improving their room standards if they would like to keep up with the competition.

<Content>Great Hotel but not so good welcome... We stayed 4 days. The hotel was confortable and nice. The big deception was about people at the desk. They should take more care of the customers. We just had a hello yes no this is your room number That's all. The last days we had to check out at noon but we were leaving at 2pm. We had to carry down our luggages because the people in charge was out for lunch and nobody helped us even to keep the door opened to put our luggages out ! I asked for a cab and just had a grab one outside ! answer, that's all. Not even a goodbye have a nice trip back We were really disapointed with the unwelcoming people at the front desk ! The housekeeping people were very kind fortunately. The smell of chlore is too important in entrance because of the pool.

<Content>Great location near Time Square Was very impressed with the hotel and particularly its midtown location. The hotel pool/steam room were great - once of the best steam rooms I've experienced. The room was tidy and of a good size, and the bed was massive. On the 4th floor there was virtually no noise from the street below and apart from noise from others inthe hotel coming back from a night out, there was generally very little noise. Great idea to serve breakfast until 12pm on weekends as well!Only issue (this is more a general observation and not a criticism of this hotel) was the price - not sure whether it was the time of year, but the cost was very high.

<Content>Amazing Grace Stayed for three days over the Thanksgiving weekend, and had a wonderful time. Great location, and convenient to everywhere in Manhattan we were aiming.We did not spend a lot of time there, but when we made it back to our room, it was a wonderful sleep on a wonderful bed, and we awoke ready to enjoy more of the city. (And the loft bed was both very convenient, and incredibly fun) A great breakfast in the hotel later, we then went off for another day of enjoying the city. Will definitely remember this when we visit New York again. Thanks.

<Content>Good clean hotel. With the great metro location is not a major problem with most tourist hotels. This hotel is located at one end of the main pedestrian street, loads of bars, restaurants, few mins to Plaza Mayor and Plaza Sol, so at night no need to take the metro, major benefit. It is on a side street so it is quietBreakfast was great, local meats, cheeses, bread and other items. Local papers from London, Frankfurt and Madrid they also have a computer available downstairs with free internet access. Overall a nice, clean hotel.Only complain would be the bathtub, only used as a shower. The tub is around 1 meter long and around 4/5 of that is covered by a non-movable glass barrier(water block), that leaves 1/5 to get out not a problem except the towel rack is blocking a part and with my 6 foot+ height I had to duck to get in and out, which made it a little slippery. Not good if you are disabled or elderly.This was in a double room, due to discount price and availability got the double for less then a single.

<Content>very good location We spent 4 days in Madrid with a friend from 14 til 18 of November in Mario hotel.The hotel is very good located in the centre of Madrid at metro station Opera. But if you are coming from the airport (as we were)- it is not really very convenient by metro because you have to change the lines twice- so you are going by 3 different metro lines. It takes not so much time but actually we came to Madrid on Friday about 16 PM and it was a great crowd in metro. So we passed through some trains but all of them were full, so we got inside with great problems and decided to go to the airport for our coming back by taxi. I can say that it costed us 40 eur by taxi. I would say much more expencive than we were expecting... The guy at the reception told us it should cost about 25 eur. But we had our taxi early in the morning (about 5:30) and we had Terminal 4, that is the most far situated. May be that was the reason of the high price.About the hotel.... By hotel graduation it has 2 stars superior. It has nice desigh. Of course all the desigh is made from not expencive materials but anyway it looks good. We had standart room in white colors. Two twin beds. And the window looking to the inside. So its not even yard view- its just small space between four walls. But we didnt mind- we had all the time blind closed. The bathroom with a bath. Safe box in the room. Big wardrobe. We were thinking we had not big mirror in the room- only one we had in the bathroom, but at the last day we recognized its inside the wardrobe on the door:)Little LDC tv, i would say too little for watching, its like a pc display. But we only were listening to music channels so it wasnt a problem for us...Every day after cleaning we found green apple on the bedside table- very pleasant surprise:)Individual thanks to cleaning lady (if i dont make mistake her name is Esther)- she is so sunny, nice, allways smiling person.The breakfats is served till 12:00- good enough- cheese, ham, toasts, musli, yogurts, spanish tortilla.Sometimes we were lost in hotels corridors, but its not so difficult as it could seem from the first time...Sometimes when we were relaxing before dinner it was rather loud for sleeping, but in the morning time- no claim.The reception very helpful, answering all the questions.Also there is a PC in the corner so you can check your mail if you need- no fee.The location of the hotel is great- centre. So we didnt use public transport at all- all the time walking around on foot. One day we took city bus tour- it cost appr.16 eur for one day, 20 eur for two days. its very nice to see all the sightseeings- and you can hop on hop off during all the day...We booked the hotel on the hotels website and we got special offer- stay 4 nights with Mario. It costed us 470 eur- 4 days for 2 people. So very nice design hotel at the very good centre location with late breakfasts till 12:00 and helpful staff.

<Content>Good hotel in good location We stayed in the Room Mate Mario for four nights at the end of October 2008. Having stayed there once before and been impressed, booked again for another stay.Prices were high for the holiday week so we had booked an ordinary room. The first room offered had a view to the outside, but the windows did not properly shut. The hotel immediately came to check, verified that the window would not shut, and so promptly showed me two other rooms, one of which I accepted. Gracias, Samuel, for being so efficient.The room was rather stuffy as the weather had been good for a couple of days, but the aircon had been moved to 'heat'. However as the windows opened, this was not a problem.The room was small, but well-apportioned, with a generous wardrobe, cupboards, large bed, small flat screen TV and large bathroom with shower.Free internet was in the room with a password from reception, and the hotel was happy to print our boarding passes for us.Breakfast was included and huge, and included soya milk and a large selection of cold breakfast things.Location is perfect, on a quiet street just minutes from Opera metro station but a short walk to Gran Via, restaurants, bars and the Chueca area.

<Content>Mario - very convenient! Excellent location in the Opera district of Madrid, easy access to metro. Urban, minimalist design very comfortable. GREAT breakfast buffet, until 12:30 pm. Nice touches - even apples in the room! Computer with internet connection in the lobby, that was a bonus. Staff very friendly and helpful.We stayed just one night at a time, two separate times, and they kept luggage for us in between. One room was a bit larger than the other, but both were adequate for our needs.Note - there is no bellboy and there are a few stairs to negotiate, even after you take the elevator to your floor or the breakfast room. Enjoy!Diana [--]

The front desk staff was friendly and helpful and offered to store our luggage since we arrived early and our room was not yet ready. We were able to check email in the lobby from an available computer and were comfortable lounging in the hip lobby areas. The room was huge and very modern, with comfy beds and a great large bathroom. We were able to make changes to our reservations with ease (stay an extra night in the same double room). We also loved the breakfast buffet. The Room Mate Mario exceeded expectations on all levels and had the best location of all the hotels we stayed at in Madrid.

<Content>Excellent budget-boutique hotel An excellent find (through TripAdvisor originally). The Room Mate concept is of a design hotel, with all the services I require, for a very attractive price. The rooms are clean and functional, with minimalist design. The lobby and the corridors are attractively decorated. The breakfast was plentiful and varied. Free wi-fi is always good, and there was a terminal available for guests without laptops or whatever device of their own.The Mario hotel is right in the centre, very convenient for pretty much anything.Discounts are available for multiple nights, which I will certainly be taking advantage of next time I am in Madrid.

<Content>Great location Room Mate Mario is in a fantastic location, right near the Palacio, Square and Opera. It is also around the corner from the Monastery. The closest Metro station is 1 minute walk. The staff were helpful, always pretty happy. The breakfast was good compared to other breakfasts in Spain. The room was very spacious, although the bed was too hard for our liking. The shower was a bit weird as it did not have a door or curtain so you had to make sure that the water did not go everywhere. The air conditioning needed to be looked at and was on their list. The hotel was very fresh and funky and they had wireless internet as well as a computer to use. Overall we had a good experience - the best things were location, hotel presentation and breakfast. We would stay again if in Madrid again.

<Content>Great location Considering this is a 2 star property I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the location on Calle Campomanes is excellent. And the first impression of the hotel is great: The lobby is minimalistic and chic and very very cool. The people at the front desk were always nice and helpful, and - compared to the rest of the city - spoke great English.Our room (117) was located on the first floor, facing the street. The Madrilenos are talkative and loud people, particularly when they've had a couple of drinks, but that's about the only noise we experienced from the otherwise quiet street (Calle Campomanes). The rooms are minimalistic and quite small, with an interesting en suite bathroom. Basically the shower and the toilet is in the same room as the bed, only hidden by a glass door. If you're sensitive to those kinds of sounds, you should probably find someplace else to stay... The sink and the mirror is however placed outside these glass walls right in front of the bed, which I found nice as I could put on my make-up (although the lighting was not too good) and get ready while my boyfriend was taking a shower. Our room was conveniently located only a few feet away from the breakfast area, but this also proved to be negative as there was quite a bit of noise in the early mornings. I believe rooms 116, 117 and 118 are the only rooms affected by this - so my advise would be to ask to switch if you get one of these three.The breakfast itself was excellent though. It's the continental type, which means you have a buffet to choose from. The Spanish potato omelette is highly recommended ;)Also, kudos for free wi-fi in all rooms!

<Content>Mario Did the Job Mario is nicely located within a couple blocks of the Royal Palace and a 5 minute walk to Plaza Mayor and Puerta de Sol. The Room Mate hotel chain seems to be opening new properties which were booked at the time we planned our trip. Mario was one of the only properties left as we would have liked a newer property such as Oscar. Our room was clean and nicely sized facing the street with a small balcony. Noise was not an issue for us as the windows did a great job of blocking out sound. We were only a couple floors off the street and didn't hear a peep. The hotel isn't on a main street, so it was relatively quiet anyway.The hotel delivered what was expected, but showed signs of wear and tear. Breakfast was included in the rate and was a nice selection of fruits, breads, meats, cheeses, tortillas (spanish egg and potato omelette), and cereals.The staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke great English. Free online access in the lobby helped us build our game plan for our nights out in the city.I would stay at the Mario again, however, would probably try to stay at a newer property.

Good sized, attractively decorated rooms and bathrooms. We were at the back so didn't have much of view, but not a problem.The staff were helpful and friendly .The breakfast was very good and was available from 7.30 until 12.Conventiently located about 5 minutes walk from the Palace Real - if you're an EU citizen free entry on a Wednesday and changing of the guard every first Weds of the month except in July and August, which was impressive (don't forget photocopy of passport). About 10 minutes walk in the other direction lots of bars  main shopping area..

<Content>everything perfect, above all the continental breakfast The hotel is very clean and a wonderful continental breakfast is served. Hotel attendaces are confident and professional, and they welcome you each day of your staying with an apple on your bed... I hope it was a way to wish the guests goodmorning...if not, it means that every day of our staying, my husband and me had eaten the fornitures.... :-)

<Content>Just great value for money Having just returned from five days at the Mario, the hotel is such great value for money. The location is ideal for walking to a lot of the major attractions if you do not walk the Opera Metro is about a 100mts away. we had a front standard room which was very clean equipped with a safe at no extra charge, the reception staff are all so pleasant and receptive to your needs, the continental breakfast buffet is of a very high standard and available until noon. We would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Nice Rooms in good part of the city The hotel has a nice design of the entrance, the rooms, etc. The have everything arranged in detail.The service and the breakfast was excellent.In comparison with the price the room we had was quite small. What we also suffered a little bit of the noises of the nearby hostel.The location of the hotel was perfect. About three minutes walk from the Palacio Real and the Plaza del Sol. There were a lot of recommendable restaurants nearby.

<Content>good base for madrid Hi!We stayed at the Alicia for two nights last week on a short holiday in madrid.What we liked:great location - plaza santa ana had great buzz even on monday night yet we did not hear any street noise from our room.great price.very friendly staff - it isn't often that you get asked how everything was at checkout or such a personal welcome on arrivalthe room was great (107) - very clean, nicely laid out, good supplies of towels, toiletries etc.breakfast til 11:30 great for giving opportunity to sleep in while on holiday. fruit salad excelentwebsite easy to negotiateroom for improvement?coffee at breakfast was horrible: any chance of nicer coffee??while there was no noise in our room from the street we did hear shouts on both nights from guests in another hotel room: bit disturbing and might put me off staying at alicia again. I wish hotel designers would consider sound proofing rooms more!thank youAnne-Marie

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Great Location Room Mate Hotel Mario is simply great! Perfect location in the heart of Madrid and just a few step from Opera underground station. Staff was always really kind and helpful (my sincere compliments). They gave me room 222 which was a large and really confortable room. Good point for the spacious walk-in shower!!! A rich buffet breakfast (that you can have until noon) is included in the rate. If you come to Madrid you should definetly visit this hotel considering also the fact that you pay just 100/150 euro per night.

<Content>Basic but good Basic hotel with just reception and breakfast room in the public areas. That said, room was clean and well maintained and bathrooms very good (we had two rooms as a family). Breakfast a highlight as ever with this chain - excellent continental and thrown in with the very reasonable price. Location very central - a couple of minutes from Palacio Real and main shopping area but not at all noisy as down a side street. Staff all spoke good English and were very friendly and competent. In value for money terms 10 out of 10. We would recommend this place and indeed this chain and will stay with them again.

<Content>We must have been unlucky For the last few years I've used this web site before booking a holiday and have always found it more that usfull but this time we really seem to have been unlucky. Having said that we really enjoyed our time in Madrid which is an excellent city.The location of the hotel is excellent as it's just a short walk from the Opera Metro which itself is ideally situated for site seeing.Entering reception would be like entering an easyjet nightclub if there were such a thing; orange and black decor, dimmed lighting and tecno music playing.We booked a superior room and upon entering it was not what I was expecting. it was of reasonable size but the carpet was worn, splatter marks of something on the headboard (blood/coke, I don't know) and the room and its fitments were generally tired looking.The door to the bathroom was an old sliding door dangling on a boxed in runner which leaves an inch or two gap between the bathroom and bedroom (so if you're going there with someone you've only recenly met you'll get to know more about each other quicker than you might like!!)I went to reception to say we'd booked a superior room and was told, nicely, that it was a superior room.I can only assume this room was to be refurbished soon as it was nothing like the other reviews I've read so whilst we'd happily go back to Madrid again we will not be staying with Mario.

<Content>Lovely hotel We stayed here after leaving the hotel Emperador because it was so bad and the move really turned our holiday around.They fitted us in at the last minute when they were really busy and then up graded us to a junior suite. The staff were all fantastic, friendly and helpful with good English.The room was massive and really nicely decorated in a simple style which made it feel even lighter and airier than it was. The location was perfect. Right in the centre of everything. Our room was nice and quiet, I understand some rooms are noisier, but I think a little noise is to be expected in the centre of a capital city. Breakfast was good, served in a nice room with a really good selection. It was self service but the staff were really efficient at replacing food as they ran out and cleaning tables as people left. Even though the hotel was full while we were there the breakfast room was never crowded (perhaps because of the generously long breakfast hours).The only negative I can think of is that the bathroom was nothing special and not decorated to my taste (black tiles) and the sink was in the bedroom while I would personally prefer it in the bathroom. The holder of our shower was also broken, but it was still usable and I can鈥檛 blame the hotel too much for this as we forgot to report it (it obviously didn鈥檛 bother us that much).Overall a great stay. I think we will come back, though next time we would like to try the Room Mate Alicia. We鈥檝e already been to the Laura which was just as good as the Mario though we didn鈥檛 like the location quite as much. I whole heartedly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel Stayed at the Room Mate Mario for my Hen Do. It was the most perfect choice. The hotel is modern and very clean. Staff were extremely helpful and let us keep the room longer so we could change before going to the airport. The breakfast is amazing, it is served until 12 and there is loads of choice. The location is minutes from Puerto Del Sol and Plaza Mayor and yet quiet enough to get some sleep. I could not have asked for better. Will definately stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Decent Hotel at an Excellent Location Stayed for 3 nights on a room facing the street. Luckily the hotel was on a quiet side street, because any shouting or loud vehicles passing by was quite audible inside the room. The room was very basic, but clean with a comfortable bed. The air-conditioning worked great. I thought that the free breakfast buffet had enough variety and was plentiful. The hotel had one computer in the lobby guests can use to check email or look up something on the web. The hotel also had a Music Lounge and a Reading Lounge but didn't get a chance to check out either. Hotel was very close to Palacio National and walking towards Puerta del Sol, there were plenty of decent and cheap food options. Location was a 2min walk to the Opera metro stop. Since part of Line 2 (red line) was closed at the time we often walked to the Sol metro stop to catch Line 1 (blue line) for the museums. The walk to the Sol metro was not very far maybe a 10min walk at most. One complaint I had is the bathroom. The sliding glass door was not a big deal, but the entire floor would get wet every time we took a shower (no tub). It got so bad that the small towel you put down the floor is soaked and won't soak up anymore water; leaving the floor completely wet.

<Content>Not as good as advertised The hotel was not as nice as the website suggested. The room was small and clean with a tv, but was decorated in a very basic fashion. The style is supposed to be minimalist but this seems to be an excuse for cheap furniture and white walls without any character. The bathroom was pleasant enough but the toilet seat was broken and the shower did not drain very quickly.The buffet breakfast was pleasant without being anything special.The staff were friendly enough, and helpful when we asked them questions.Overall the room was clean and in a good location but not as nice as the website suggested. It is not the elegant chic place as advertised and is overpriced.

<Content>Trendy design hotel with friendly service The hotel is in the heart of the old town of Madrid. The area is lively in general, but the hotel is on a small, quieter street. Overall, we were really satisfied with the hotel. Smart looking rooms and common areas, above average breakfast, efficient air conditioning (a must in Madrid!), free wi-fi everywhere in the hotel, and friendly and flexible staff made our stay very enjoyable. They even let us sneak in the breakfast room early on our day of departure, to get some fruit and youghurt before heading to the airport at dawn. The hotel advertises rooms with a street or patio view. We did not have the street view, so seeing the wall of the next building and neighbours' laundry hanging from windows must count as the patio view.We paid less than 130 euros / night (including tax) and with that price I would stay again at Room Mate Mario.

<Content>Funky Room-Mate The location of the hotel is PERFECT!its close to everything..restaurants,theatres,the metro etc..The buffet breakfast was good and the staff were really friendly and helpful. I arrived at the hotel at around 9pm and the staff already knew I was coming and everything was ready. I asked to change rooms TWICE and they were very accommodating about it(no extra charges for a bigger room!) I suggest to any couples who are planning to stay in this hotel to get an executive room instead of the standard ones, and ask for a room facing the streets as you'll have two large windows and more sunlight. It was quite noisy during the last two nights though(sounded like someone was dragging and banging their bags on the roadside) but other than that, everything was perfect! I highly recommend the room-mate chain of hotels for their excellent value for money and service.

<Content>Mucho mas que Mario! The Room Mate Mario is diagonally opposite the Opera metro exit, across the plaza, and slightly uphill on c/ Campomanes. From the minute we stepped in, we were blown away by the hotel. Funky decor, reading area, free internet - that's just within the first 10 metres!Reception, at check-in, recommended a street-facing room (the views were nicer) so we agreed. Got to our room, and were extremely impressed. For North Americans, the room would have seemed slightly compact, but all the facilities needed were there. Plasma screen TV (only one English-speaking channel though), mini-bar (with space for storing your own items, much appreciated), digital safe, fully functioning bathroom with insane power shower, an expansive double bed, a small balcony and free apples each day!!! The breakfast, provided as part of the room price, was more than substantial. No greasy bacon and eggs, which was no shame, but croissants, cooked meats, fruits, cake, yoghurts, juices and coffees on tap. Mario is just a short walk from the Palacio R茅al, Plaza Mayor and the Puerta del Sol and Madrid's base for many, many bars, caf茅s and eateries. Access from the airport involved 2 changes on the metro (we used line 8 to Nuevos Ministerios, then line 10 to Alonso Martinez, followed by line 5 to Opera).We highly recommended the hotel to young people or couples of any age looking for a chilled-out, trendy and good value hotel base in Madrid.

<Content>Perfect for a visit to Madrid We really enjoyed our three night stay at the Mario. The rooms are small but adequate and, like the rest of the hotel, spotlessly clean. For us, the best points were the central location in a quiet street, the excellent breakfast and the friendly staff.Our room was at the back of the hotel, with a tiny window and no views but the compensation was the quietness, apart from some inconsiderate corridor noise. We had no problems with the bathroom which actually had a (very welcome) bath in it.Our favourite place to eat was the Museo del Jamon in Calle Mayor, where you can stand at the counter with the crowd of locals and have a drink and a sandwich or eat a hot meal upstairs in the equally packed cafeteria. Great atmosphere and reasonable prices.For a full restaurant meal, try La Vaquita Argentina, tucked in a corner of the Opera square - especially good for carnivores.If you fancy a change from standard Spanish beer, Naturbier in Plaza Santa Ana brew their own German style cloudy lager. Ask for a tostada and you will get a dark version. Very tasty.The Tourist Office in Plaza Mayor do a selection of guided walks in English, lasting about an hour for around 4 Euros. We did a couple and found them very good value.Room Mate Mario is a great hotel - book it now.

<Content>Recommend the Room Mate Mario! My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in May after our overseas flight and found it quite enjoyable. Location is good, a very short walk from the Opera metro stop (though it's not immediately clear which direction Calle Campomanes is---I had to ask a woman, and I don't speak Spanish). Check-in was simple; staff was friendly. The colors are modern and intriguing. The hallways go up stairs and down and on and on, but the room was spotless and large enough. Firm beds (which we like) and a green apple to highlight how white everything is. The bathroom had our only negative comment: our shower was poorly designed, so that when I used the handheld shower, water went everywhere, and there's no place to hang the towels without them getting wet. Breakfast (included) was excellent! Lots of choices, including protein (yogurt, ham, cheese) and little chocolate croissants. It's only a couple blocks from the Royal Palace, and we walked through Puerto del Sol (not at all appealing, due to construction, crowds, and trash) to the Prado, which took about 25 minutes.I booked online and was prepared to pay 125E for the good location, but I discovered that with my early-bird booking (3 months out), the room was only 90E. That is a great deal!

<Content>Great little hotel Loved this hotel, it is excellent value for money, bright and cheerful, with very friendly staff who fall over themselves to be helpful.Only two problems, as others have said, it is noisey. We could hear everything going on in the next room, shower, toilet flushing even the conversation which was annoying.The other problem was the bathroom, althoug spotless, the shower plughole seemed to be getting blocked and the water was slow to drain. This meant that it was impossible to shower without flooding the bathroom and the door frame was going rotten from constant soakings and it made the door stick.It's the only hotel where I've had to shoulder the bathroom door in order to get out. Badly designed bathroom I think.Other than that, hotel is fine, lovely generous breakfast. Would stay again

<Content>Mario in Madrid! What a hip and easy way to stay in Madrid! We spent two nights at Room-Mate MARIO in Madrid. SO PERFECTLY located - a nice long walk to the Prado and all the wonderful spots in between - great location to Teatro Real for theatre, opera, dance and concerts - couldn't be CLOSER! Also perfectly located to the Metro/Subway and many fun restaurants, shops and bars. The property was SPOTLESS, the staff very helpful - with my broken Spanish and their English, we did just fine. We were MOST impressed with the breakfast buffet. It was HUGE and very well managed. The Dining room was bright and cheery and a great way to start the day - no matter what time you start it. B'fast went from 7-12!! We loved having a room on the street side (could almost TOUCH the building across the narrow street!) - with French doors to open for fresh air, urban din and, of course, hanging out some laundry. It was a great way to take in ALL the essences of Madrid in a small pace. Also, VERY smart of management to have ALL things electrical work based on putting the room keycard into a slot ... Surely, very energy efficient ... You leave? You take the key and everything goes OFF. HIGHLY recommend this property. We understand their Room-Mate property nearby also offers self-service laundry for those who'd need/want it. Mind you, the space is MINIMAL (a bath, a bed, a chair) Terrifically firm bed for hanging out and sleeping - it's perfect for an urban stay - as a tourist or business traveller. Loads of outlets and connections for all your gizmos. Free Internet in the Lobby!Lois  Jim - Chicago, IL USA

<Content>Excellent location - in the heart of the City Just returned from 5 nights at the Mario in Madrid.The hotel is situated down a nice quiet street some 100 metres from Plaza Isabel II (known as Plaza Opera) and 150 metres from Opera Metro station.Reception staff at the hotel were very good being both helpful and pleasant. Breakfast choice was excellent and very fresh.Our room (120) was a good size, very clean, well equipped and more than comfortable. My only gripe about the hotel relates to the noise created by inconsiderate guests returning during the small hours from a night out and the noise they make. The corridors are not carpeted and are quite echoey with regard to loud voices and singing etc which at 4 a.m. can be a bit much if you are trying to sleep. Prospective visitors be aware also that rooms 116 thru to 120 are all going to suffer from this. Rooms 116 - 118 are all located immediately adjacent to the breakfast room entrance and I would think any chance of a totally peaceful lay in is out of the window with the traffic of guests going to/from breakfast.Because of the transport system it's easy to get around the city. It is also great for walking around. Reported elsewhere on TA are the museums so I won't mention them. I would recommend a visit to the Royal Palace, Plaza Mayor, the Retiro Park and also the area around Plaza Santa Ana.There are so many restaurants in Madrid all I can do is recommend the ones I visited that I would return to again:Restaurante El Buey, Plaza Marina Espa帽ola 1 - the asparagus tart and the beef dish (Lomo) where you cook on sizzling plates was excellentArroceria Gala, Calle da Moratin 22 - the paella is superb and the venue really great.Around the Plaza Santa Ana there are some many eateries to choose from but I would recommend totally La Casa Del Abulo Calle Victoria 12 - its all prawns and they are truly scrumptious. There is also another tapas bar almost opposite this one that does some great tapas as well. I am salivating at the thought!If you can be bothered it is well worth getting a bit out of the main centre as there are loads of places to eat and the price drops as it is not quite so touristy. Must say the cheaper end of the restaurants we saw in the Plaza Mayor looked overpriced as you quite clearly pay for the location. The expensive restaurants are easily identified, and I am sure are fine but I would suggest TA visitors looking for a cheaper option would do well to avoid here.Madrid is a fun place to visit and there is more than enough to do there however if you fancy a change make the effort to get to Toledo. You will not be disappointed.We will certainly return.

<Content>Loved it! Just got back from a two night stay at the Room Mate Mario. The room and the hotel were incredibly clean. The breakfast was lovely and the staff were EXCEPTIONALLY pleasant (honestly!). Would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would return on my next trip to Madrid!

<Content>Room Mate Mario Great The entire experience at Room Mate Mario was perfect. Upon our arrival the receptionist was so friendly and warm to us, we instantly felt at home. The room, an executive one, was large, the bed so big and it was nice to have the ottoman at the foot and the bay window with the leather cushions. Everything was very comfortable.The location is excellent; very close to metro stop, the Puerta del Sol and other sights, plus half a block by the performing arts center.Our only question was the shower door, with just half a glass door, the water came out on the floor even though I tried to turn the shower head toward the wall.The breakfast buffet was the best assortment of healthy choices and all the fun croissants, etc. This was the best breakfast buffet we experienced on our trip to four cities.I thought it was a nice touch to send a reminder email a couple of days before we came.

<Content>Spotless and In a great location! My husband (age 71) and I (age 49) were very pleasantly surprised at the modern sleekness of the hotel and its rooms. The rooms were slightly compact but modern, very clean, nice linens, upgraded TV and a minibar that was stocked with my kind of stuff!! The biggest bonus was checking in around 1040PM and still having a restaurant three doors down that was open (The WOk). ALtho we were both sick with colds and only got to spend a few hours exploring Madrid, the hotel and an english news tv channel did a lot to help us feel better. Would definitely return; staff is a real treasure; and would recommend to others and stay at a mario roommate in other locations. Thanks for a great stay!Kim and Chuck, Florida, USA

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location We stayed at Room Mate Mario in April 2008 and we really enjoyed the hotel. The hotel is modern in design and is kept very clean. The rooms are standard by European sizes. We did have an issue in one of the rooms we stayed in - there is no shower door and so the water runs out all over the floor. However, we stayed in a different room our last night there and that bathroom had a much better set up.The hotel staff is excellent and were extremely helpful. The hotel has a breakfast room set up each morning, which included breads, breakfast rolls, juices, coffee, etc.We loved the location of the hotel. It is very close to a Metro Station (the metro in Madrid is very easy to use) and is close to many sites, shops, bars, restaurants, etc.We had a great vacation in Madrid and would certainly stay at Room Mate Mario again.

<Content>New Year's Eve at Mario We stayed at Mario on 30th and 31st December while visiting friends for New Year in Madrid. The entrance is discreet on a realy pretty and relatively quiet street (with a nice restauarnt opposite where we stopped at the bar for a great bloody mary!)The hotel is really laid back and the atmosphere is chilled out which we really loved. Very modern and quirky without being austere, still manages to feel cosy.The rooms are fine, really clean, an ok size and a very comfy bed. Only quibbles: ithe bathrooms are TINY and it was impossible to have a shower without the whole bathroom swimming in water, and teh walls are really thin so we could hear next door's radio as if it was blaring in our room. We banged on the wall andthey turned it off though luckily. That aside though, we liked our room and spent rather a lot of time in it!The breakfasts are massive buffet affairs and were absolutely delicious... the best part was that on New Year's Day they allowed you to have breakfast up to 1pm and check out late which was utter bliss seeing as we hadnt got in til 4am!So if you dont mind a bit of noise, you'll love the supercool Mario

<Content>Great value boutique hotel in fantastic location We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Mate Mario. Although the room wasn't enormous the size and comfort of the bed more than made up for any lacking floor space. I was impressed with the variety of breakfast options and also that breakfast is served unti 12pm. The reception staff were extremely courteous and attentive. I would highly recommend this hotel for value for money and am looking forward to visiting its sister hotels in other locations.

<Content>Good value and very welcoming My wife and I have just come back from a three day stay at the Room Mate Mario in Madrid. From the moment we arrived we encountered a level of hospitality well above that we had met earlier on our ten day holiday. The hotel has a minimalist style of decor, but our room was fine and the bed was both large and very comfortable. Breakfast is more than adequate and the time you can access it is extremely flexible - 7.30 - 12.00 ! This is obviously not a luxury hotel, but it is well positioned (very central but in a quiet street) and our stay was excellent value for money.

<Content>Super Mario We had a lovely four-day stay in Madrid, enjoying the April sun and a great city.At the hotel we were warmly greeted and experienced pleasant service through the stay. We had ordered an executive room, but was upgraded to a junior suite. It was due to overbooking, but I tell myself it was because they knew I was celebrating my birthday during the stay.The breakfast buffet was great, although they only had yoghurt the first day. The room was airy and nice and the bed excellent.When all the major sights were in walking distance as well, everything made it a nice stay.We would like to come back to Madrid, and it is highly likely that we then visit Mario again.

<Content>Not bad Overall a nice hotel. Good location, good staff, free breakfast, good price. Our first room smelled like smoke though and we had to change rooms. The second one didn't smell much better due to some possible plumbing issues. Also, the shower alternated between hot and cold which was annoying, but the quality of the room was nice.

A well above average breakfast served til late morning and friendly staff.Good location too, just a five minutes walk into town.Ask for room at the front of the hotel as these have a nicer view.Only the shower was a minor glitch as the pressure and temperature were a little variable...Will definately go back.

<Content>Great Location, Good Breakfast Fantastic location close to the Opera House and Palace. Walked nearly everywhere, although there is a metro station at the end of the road.I stayed for a long weekend in early April, for a short holiday with my Mum.Staff were very helpful, fluent in English. Breakfast was a very good cold buffet selection, much better than the usual in a nice breakfast room.Just a warning though, the room we stayed in (not sure if it is the same in every room) had frosted glass between the shower and toilet and the bedroom, and the door didn't shut properly so there wasn't a lot of privacy! Hotel is nicely decorated overall, although a couple of signs of wear in the bedroom.Overall I would recommend. It was booked via Expedia at a very reasonable price.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, great location We found the Mario to be an excellent hotel. The location is fantastic and we walked everywhere, sampling more of Madrid as we did so. The room was relatively minimalist but with a very comfortable bed and decent bathroom. The staff were brilliant, really helpful and friendly. In particular Christiano (we think that was his name) was great and full of ideas, always ready to help. Although the communal areas are relatively limited, we spent a good few hours on the sunday lounging on the sofas in the front room - it genuinely did have the feel of someone (Mario's) home... Breakfast was very good, fresh bread and tortilla were our favourites but they also have cereals, jams, fruit, pastries etc. All in all a really fantastic stay for a very reasonable price. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will be back the next time we are in Madrid.

<Content>great breakfast, great location Although the room was darkish and facing inwards it was really quiet and well appointed. Geat after a day in this busy city. We were within walking distance of all the art galleries too and the metro was just around the corner, making it really easy to get to the airport. Reception staff are friendly and helpful. It was no trouble asking them to book a show or recommend a resaurant. The breakfast buffet was exceptional and consistently good. We would definitely return here, it was worth every penny!

<Content>Not as good as expected I booked this hotel for a two night stay for a short break for my fianceesbirthday. Although this hotel was good, it was not as good as I had hoped.Good points - 1. The location is fantastic, right next to metro and palace in the heart of royal Madrid and close to shops; 2. Breakfast is absolutely excellent and is served till midday, the only thing that let it down was the lack of good tea!! 3. Our room was clean and tidy with safe, tv, minibar. 4. The staff were helpful and all spoke English5. On the day of my fiancees birthday they left some fruit and a note to say happy birthday which was a nice touchBad points - 1. The smell. The corridors of the hotel had some horrible smell athough this didn't affect the rooms!2. Our room was a little small. The bathroom was tiny and theshower wasn't great. 3. We had a mix up about payment. I booked the room through Room mates website and thought that the room had already been paid for. However, I was told that card details taken here were only as a guarantee and not payment for the room.Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel, but don't set yourexpectations too high. I would like to be able to give it a 3.5!

<Content>Great value!!!! I would have to say that overall my stay was great. For the price, it was a tremendous value. The location was very good, the staff were very nice (and spoke English thankfully since I dont speak much Spanish) and the accomodations were terrific. The breakfast buffet was amazing! My only complaint (and I did put it on the in-room survey that I completed) was that my room was not as clean as I felt it should be. The bathroom was fine and the bed linens were fine but the room was dusty and the carpet needed a good vacuuming...otherwise I had not one complaint and would definetly go back to a room-mate hotel!

<Content>Great location After reading a few reviews decided to book this one. Especially since the other hotels in Madrid were expensive. Hotel was in an excellent central location, literally five minute walk from Opera metro station which made it easy to get to and from airport. We stayed in a junior suite which was very nice, clean and roomy. The Staff were excellent and very helpful. Breakfast was included which was self serve had everything you needed. Decor was very modern bordering on bizarre but made a change from normal hotels. Only let down was no hot water in late afternoon/evening over weekend once more guests had arrived. However this seems to be the norm in other hotels we stayed at in Spain including some larger more expensive ones.

<Content>Highly Recommended!! We stayed here for a long weekend/ 3 nights in mid march. We chose it as the hotel had a high ranking on tripadvisor and although it was a bit more than we wanted to pay (拢100 per night) we thought we would give it a try. I am so pleased that we did - it was a really great place to stay on our first trip to Madrid. The location was great for the Metro and also walking about. The hotel had a very trendy boutique feel - suited to younger people - well I'm 40 and include my self in that! Room's are very clean and newly fitted. Breakfast was amazing in terms of choice of stuff to eat and also it was really relaxing as they serve till noon so no big rush like you get in some hotels.I would highly recommend it and it deserves it's high ranking on Tripadvisor - really good VFM and a great experience to stay there.

<Content>Great location, helpful staff Hotel Mate Mario is a cool hotel located near the Royal Palace and the Opera near a major walking street in Madrid. The staff was great, helpful with a great breakfast served until noon! This is helpful since dinner is usually past 10 pm. The location is great, right near a Metro stop, but also within walking distance of almost all major attractions. The old wing had an electrical outtage that was quickly fixed, but in the mean time we needed to have a room with electricity to get ready. We borrowed a room in the new wing - and the difference in rooms was substantial. If you get a choice try and stay in the new wing - everything was updated and beautiful. The old wing was fine, and until we saw the other rooms, we were feeling good about it. I've traveled enought to know a good deal in a major city so I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good location room a tad small After a short flight from Jerez airport near to where I live it was nice to arrival at the hotel for 2 nights and get ready for the Bolton v Atletico Madrid game.The double room was quite small, but with a very good bathroom and fully working wi-fi internet access, which is necessary when I travel for business.Location was very good, close to tube and within walking distance of most areas. Breakfast was excellent, lots to choose from and well stocked by the kitchen staff all the time. Not many places you can get breakfast till 12 noon, much needed after a late night with fellow Bolton fans!Staff very nice and when I emailed them a document they happily printed it for me without fuss.I thing I would add is if your room happens to be in the same area as the breakfast room, you may have quite a disturbed morning with guests coming and going.

<Content>Great location, helpful and friendly staff make this hotel a winner!!! My husband and I just returned from a long weekend in Madrid. Arriving late Saturday from London, we hopped on the Metro toward the city centre. First impression of Madrid was that it was clean and efficient (almost all the airport staff spoke fluent English). We arrived at Opera station after 2 train changes and the hotel was about a block away from the station. Check in was a breeze, and we found all the staff there friendly and really helpful. Our room had a small balcony and was fresh and funky. After popping our valuables in the room safe, we went wandering. Within 5 minutes of the hotel is the royal palace and cathedral, magnificent in daytime and floodlit at night you can get some really nice atmospheric photos. There is a huge garden (Sabatini I think) next to the palace, which is fabulous. A few minute walk and we were at the Templo de Debod, and Egyptian temple in a park that is fascinating to see. The only blemish on our trip was being pickpocketed by teenage girls at Opera station. Beware anyone trying to jostle you, they are quite good and very aggressive. Lucky for us they only got 20 Euro but also my credit card. The staff at the hotel were sympathetic and helpful about reporting it (apparently they aren't immune to the criminals either). I would recommend going to Retiro Park, especially if it's nice weather. The staff at Mario will suggest non-touristy restaurants if you want to eat like the locals. Breakfast at the hotel will keep you going through most of the day and they serve from 8 until noon!! The breakfast room is quite funky as well, IKEA in an art gallery. Madrid is rich in culture and architecture, it was safe to walk around even at night. Room Mate Mario is the perfect base for exploring this city. If you get a chance, do take the 30 minute fast train to Toledo, it is an exquisite medieval walled city (but do wear comfy shoes as it is VERY hilly).

<Content>Great Location, clean, functional but small rooms - I spent 3 nights in Madrid on business and wanted to book a hotel that was very central to the downtown area in Madrid. I was not worried too much about the size of the room, I just wanted something that was clean, central and comfortable. If you are looking for a budget hotel in Madrid, with outstanding location and clean rooms, then Hotel Mate Mario is a good choice. Location: Transportation from the airport was convenient. I took the train and it dropped me off at the Opera station (about half a block walk to the hotel). The hotel is very centrally located so you can walk to most of the major destinations in the downtown area. Should you need to take the local metro, the station is half a block away. Hotel: Very clean and modern looking interior design. Kind of reminded me of the W Hotels feeling. All rooms have free wireless (which actually works well through out the hotel). I believe they had a free continental breakfast but I did not try it.Rooms: Very clean and modern looking. Comfortable but quite small. Summary: This is a good hotel if you are travelling alone. I definately would stay at the Hotel Matte Mario again if I was I was alone. If I was travelling with family or small kids, I do not think I would stay here.

<Content>Three great nights at Room Mate Mario My boyfriend and I arrived at Mario feeling exhausted from our journey from Salamanca that morning. To our chagrin, we realized that we had incorrectly written down our arrival date and gotten to Madrid a day earlier than our reservation! The front desk attendant immediately told us it was no problem and got us a room for that night. He also cheerfully made us dinner reservations and gave us directions to the places we wanted to visit. The rooms at Mario are ultra modern and clean. Our room was truly an oasis of calm after days spent in busy Madrid. The hotel is a little difficult to find the first time, as it is on a side street, but the location is in a desirable part of the city. The breakfast buffet at Mario is excellent--fresh breads, fruit, cheese, cereal and more. The best part is that you get all of this for a very low price. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Madrid!

<Content>Great Location As a special occassion was coming up and Madrid was our next city to visit we searched Tripadvisor for a good hotel.Booked through a website here and was delighted with the room rate for a superior room.We arrived last Thursday night from Dublin.We had e-mailed the hotel beforehand to confirm everything.We took a taxi which took an hour due to very heavy traffic.It cost 30 euros and the taxi driver was very sorry that it took so long and that the price was so high.We met a lovely receptionist called Aba who said that there was only one room left as they were full and we had arrived so late but that the following morning we were to go to reception and we would be sorted.Our room was tiny with a tiny window on the inside of the building and very claustrophobic but we felt we could cope with one night.The following morning as requested we went to reception to be told that no larger rooms were available.Having said all that this is really a fantastic location and we had a brilliant time in Madrid.Left for airport on Sunday morning and flew there in 25mns to be charged 48 whopping euros!!! If your not too pushed about space and confort this hotel is really about its great location.

<Content>Liked the Room Mate Mario First of all, I really liked the cool and modern design of the hotel. Secondly, the location is great - just a stone throw away from the Opera, the Royal Palace, and the city centre with lots of bars and restaurants. Yet it is really quiet: if you get a room to the back you will not hear anything!Breakfast was good, and the free-of-charge (!) wireless LAN connection worked fine. Ok, my room was a bit on the small side but then I paid far less than for comparable hotels in Madrid previously. So the overall value for money was really, really good and my experience in relation to the two-and-a-half star-rating certainly above average. I can definitely recommend this hotel!

<Content>slightly above average if you get a nice room We booked this hotel for a romantic weekend away. Having consulted a few website this sounded like the perfect funky hotel. We got there on friday evening. It was very easy to find as it is in a geat location. Reception looks amazing and the staff was really nice. There was a little mix-up with the rooms but we initially paid no attention to it. We were allocated a spacious room facing the street. Large french windows letting in the sunshine.... deco was as funky as we expected. We were well impressed with the large breakfast the next day. In the afternoon of the second day the flush broke so we asked for assistance from reception. They explained it had happened to another room and it couldnt be fixed easily (something about having to break the bathroom wall...) so they could either give us a bucket (?!) or swap us to another room. A few room swaps followed and we were assigned to a significantly smaller room with tiny windows and awkard bathroom. All along the staff were really helpful but we figured that it is a nice hotel if you are assigned one of nicest rooms (we viewed 3 over 2 days).

<Content>Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Madrid !! I have to agree with all rave reviews on this site! The Room Mate Mario is an excellent hotel!I had a wonderful stay there while in Madrid. The location is excellent, in a quiet treelined street in Opera zone, yet close to shopping, restaurants and major atractions: Palazo Real, Plaza Mayor, Gran Via, etc.It's a no frills hotel, but it has all the ingredients to make you feel as comfortable as in any 5 star hotel!Rooms are bright, spacious, imaculate, with excellent mattresses and pillows, plasma tv and even free cans of tea- They always leave a green apple on your night table . Bathroom is simple and nice and has good quality towels and a good water pressure shower.The breakfast is to die for, everything very fresh and plentiful, with good quality. I loved the breakfast room, it has a wonderful green tone!The front desk staff are very friendly and treat us with no cerimonies yet kindly, not the sort of stuffy people. I was travelling alone and I felt as if I was staying with friends.You can also access internet at the reception free of charge.To sum it up, the value for money is great. I wish I had one hotel like this in every city I visit! I wouldn't stay anywhere else! And I won't stay anywhere else when I return to Madrid!!I highly recommend Room Mate Mario to anyone who travels to Madrid and looks for quality, comfort and a good value for money.

<Content>What a Breakfast! An excellent Hotel, clean rooms, great location and what a breakfast! Kept us going on our first day until 6pm! Can't recommend it enough. The teatro real is 100yds away, the Kings palace just behind it and the 'opera' metro station literally on the doorstep.If you are staying here, some tips on the local area. The Argentinian bar (la vaca) in the near left-hand corner of the square is excellent and very reasonable, particularly if you eat from the bar menu. Also, very friendly and nice atmosphere. The bar/restaurant that runs along the left edge to the Calle Arenal is good but expensive (a beer was over 4 euros). One final thing, when out shopping around Puerto Del Sol avoid the Calle Montero at all costs. Full of dodgy rude shops and ladies of a certain profession (and all this during the day!)

<Content>great location Great boutique style hotel with emphasis on the style. Well maintained, spotlessly clean, friendly staff  good continental style breakfast. Ideal location next to the opera metro stop  few minutes walk to the beautiful plaza de oriente gardens where you can sit at an outside bar  watch the world go by.All sights easily accessible on foot or on metro. We got taxi from airport for convenience but cost 35 euros - went back on metro - 2 euros per person!Take care especially on metro when crowded as pick pocketing is rife.Loved madrid (weather suny  warm in feb!) Retiro park beautiful, plaza Mayor very grand, plaza de santa Ana nice outside cafe bars.

<Content>Nice hosts Hello,I went to Madrid with a friend and we stayed in Hotel Roommate Mario. We had booked quite in advanced, so we were a bit dissapointed with the room we got. This problem was less important thanks to the kindness and sympathy of the receptionnist who helped us to have another room for the rest of the stay. The hotel is well located and nice decorated but I would say that it is a little overpriced. Design is good but the quality of the materials is also important and maybe these are not the best standard. Breakfast was quite good, but the most of this hotel -besides location- is its personnel, nice and kind above the average. Keep doing like this. Thanks,Josep Maria, travelling from Brussels.

<Content>Above average, but... A nice small design hotel, with some problems. Our room costed more than oru friend's room and it had a smaller bath, a smaller interior and a very nice terrace that would have been useful during spring or summer, but was completely useless in winter time. The hotel is very central, but for this reason there's a little noise during the night (Madrid people use to party all night in the streets and squares). There is free wifi (and it's pretty fast) and at the reception they allowed me to print the online checkin boarding pass for free. I really appreciated that. If you have kids, just ask for a junior suite. It's non possible to book four people in that kind of room if you book online but, if you ask, there's no problem and kids under 12 don't pay. Overall, it is an above average accomodation.

<Content>Excellent Value It was our 1st trip to Madrid and we had a lot of concern and reservations about safety issue. However, we were pleasantly surprised with Room Mate Mario. It was situated at a very convenient location. All the attractions are within walking distance. The hotel is trendy and clean. Breakfast is great. We simply love it and we highly recommend this hotel.The LeongsSingapore

<Content>Brilliant place to stay in Madrid! Just returned from a 5 night stay in Mario as part of our honeymoon and we are in absolute agreement with all of the positive comments that other reviewers have already made; Room Mate Mario is a brilliant place to stay in Madrid!The location is superb. Very close to Opera metro stop (1-2 minutes), it's also within 10 minutes walking of Plaza de Callao, Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor and that's no exaggeration. The street on which the hotel is located is very quiet by Madrid standards and we were never disturbed by noise at night. It's also a very safe area and not as intense as Sol even though it's so close.The rooms are spotless and decorated in a modern minimalistic style with tv, desk etc and very nice bathrooms. Throughout our stay the cleaning was excellent. The hotel has aircon even though we didn't need it in Feb. The breakfast (served until 12:00!!!) is very good in variety and quality.But the best thing about the hotel was the quality of the staff. Extremly friendly and professional yet never fawning, they made us feel so welcome and this contributed greatly to our wonderful holiday. Mario is a fantastic place to stay. Highly recommended!

<Content>incredible staff! February 2008What I appreciated most of all would have to be the staff. I was greeted so warmly upon arrival, it felt like I had walked into a good friend's house. There was a very relaxed, natural way about everyone; they looked happy to be working there and therefore made me feel content to be there as well. Their restaurant suggestions were excellent. There was a great breakfast buffet and nice little details in the room and in the lobby. I definitely will come back.

<Content>Different Indeed....Great Location This hotel is smack bang in the middle of Madrid and central for a lot of the main sites and museums.For example the royal palace is a five minute walk.Easy to get to from the airport via the metro, Opera station is about two minutes walk away. Buy a tourist card for the metro and buses at the airport station.The hotel. We had a room on the first floor. It was a reasonable size but had no view to speak of. Be warned one of the rooms is adjacent to the breakfast room so everyone in the hotel walks past this door. Room was a little on the small size but clean and obviously recently redecorated. All fixtures and fittings are of the ultra modern design as are the colours used. Definately a matter of taste and I must admit rather an aquired taste.Breakfast was buffet style and was very good catering for the health concious and the not so...Sausages and bacon etc.Overall at good hotel. If you can put up with the decor (see sites for pics) the hotel can be highly recommended, especialy for it's location.

<Content>OK but not great I booked this hotel through Opodo. Bad start at checking in - I had a printout of a confirmed reservation, but they did not have it in their system, and although they had a room, the rate they charged me was (slightly) higher. The hotel is very modern and is of an interesting design but I found the decor and lighting a bit weird. The room was clean, modern and in good condition - it was very small but I have no problem with this for a city hotel. Strangely, a light seemed to come on inside the air conditioning vent periodically and I found this rather irritating during the night. Breakfast is included in the room rate and was nice but nothing out of the ordinary.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Breakfast, Great Location (but too loud hallways!) We really loved Mario... the breakfast every morning was unbelievable. Delicious coffee, tortilla, tomato puree, sweets, fruit, cheese, lomo, etc. etc. And they let you get it till NOON! Unreal. It's in such a great location - we never took the metro once. We really are missing Madrid, but my stomach probably couldn't take another piece of pork. The only reservation I have is with the hallways. They are loud and you hear everyone coming home at night. It's not carpeted so heels are a killer noise and voices, even at a whisper are echoed. We had this idiot 22 year old American come home around 5.30AM after a night of going to the clubs and he brought 'home' 10 of his closest friends. They kept me up for an hour until another disgruntled person must've called the front desk. They were hanging in the hallways. Regardless of this - it's a great stay. We love you MARIO!

<Content>Great price, great location, great breakfast, very clean I lived in Madrid as a student for a year and returned with my boyfriend in November 2007. We booked through an online holiday website and as I knew the area knew it to be very central and very close to the metro and in a safe area.The location is second to none, 5min walk to Puerta del Sol (the centre of Madrid) and 1min walk from Opera metro station. The hotel is also just off a plaza but we were never disturbed by noise levels.Upon arrival staff were very efficient and before arrival had quickly responded to my email enquiry. The hotel is ideal for young people and couples travelling. Our room was spotless and the beds comfortables. The only thing is people may feel odd that the bathroom is separated from the main room by frosted glass but as a couple we didn't mind really.The breakfast is buffet style and served from 7am -12pm. The range of food and juices were excellent (breads, pastries, yoghurts, meats, cheeses etc).The price is very fair for such a central and clean hotel. When I next return I know not to look anywhere else!

<Content>Mario was a good choice Very good location -- near museums and on a square full of restaurants and bars. The room was pretty large and comfortable. The glass enclosed shower is right in the room, which might be a problem for someone shy. The windows were very good; once we closed them, the street noise was gone. Also, the drapes and shades were well-thought out for maximum sleep. Breakfast was included, making our early booking special rate even better.

The staff was unbelievably helpful and suggested what was to become our favorite restaurant during our 11 day stay in Spain. The complimentary breakfast buffet was over the top. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! And our thanks to the staff!

<Content>Great hotel, shame about the noise Conveneient location 2 mins form opera metro. Travelled by metro from airport which took about an hour. The hotel definitely has the wow factor. Each room is different - we had 2: one was a twin overlooking the street. It was a good size and had 2 Romeo and Juliet balconies and a full bathroom, It was rather noisy at times due to nightlife and traffic. The 2nd room was a double. The room was small, with a large comfy bed. There was a sink in the room and a shower room with wc. We looked out over other rooms and could hear the lift and footsteps because the corridors are tiled rather then carpeted. Breakfast was from 7-noon, self-service, varied and plentiful. The staff were helpful and friendly at all times. We walked miles and saw too much to list individually but would particularly recommend the Bernabeu tour.

<Content>OK Hotel We stayed here between 29th December and 3rd January. Location is excellent- 2 minutes to Metro. Most sights were within walking distance. Breakfast was good for a 2 star hotel. There was plenty of food and the staff were continuously filling it up. There was never a shortage of anything for long. The rooms were very clean and were in fact cleaned even on New Years day.The bed was very hard. We could hear, without difficulty, our kids who were in the room through the wall.They had a door to block the bathroom and shower off from the beds. This gave them some privacy. We did not have anything seperating the toilet from the sleeping area other than a bit of frosted glass. This meant there was no soundproofing! It was not too much hassle for us as we have been married for a while but there could be a large amount of embarrassment for some guests. This was room 224.

<Content>Great hotel in the middle of Madrid Just back from Madrid after celebrating the new year there and what a fantastic hotel to stay in. It's located just off Plaza Isobelle and 2 minutes walk away from the hub if Madrid. It's on a side street, so it's nice and quiet. It's also very close to a Metro station (there's one on Plaza Isobelle)The rooms are individually decorated in a boutique style, very roomy (we had a double), clean and great facilities (air con, TV, phone etc.). The staff are very friendly and also very helpful, especially when your Spanish is not that good. Didn't have breakfast, so can't comment on that. I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't stay in this hotel. It's only a 2 star, but don't let that fool you. A fantastic hotel in the middle of Madrid and very reasonable too.

<Content>Fab Boutique Hotel We recently spent 4 nights at the Room Mate Mario. The boutique hotel was fabulous! It is is conveniently located in the heart of the city within walking distance to the Plaza Mayor, Sol and Palacio Real. The Plaza de Isabel II just around the corner from the hotel is filled with vendors during the day and offers economical shopping options. If you enjoy chocolate, the Chocolateria San Gines off of Calle del Arenal at Pasadizo de San Gines is to die for! However, don't expect to enjoy your chocolate and churros seated and there may be a short wait.The hotel is cleverly designed in chic, modern style from the lobby to the guestrooms and dining room. We were not expecting much from the breakfast, so it turned out to be a pleasant surprise when we saw the delicious spread of hams, cheeses, quiche, cereals, freshly baked bread, yogurts and fruit.The hotel staff were very friendly and courteous. We arrived to the hotel at 6:30 a.m. exhausted from our flight and lack of sleep, so it was much appreciated when the hotel staff allowed us to check in early and enjoy breakfast on the house (normally the breakfast would not be included for your arrival day, only the next morning).Downsides of the hotel: small room, but not the end of the world in Madrid where there's so much to see and do; small beds, not very comfortable; shower is poorly designed and leaks water; we felt like rats getting lost in the maze of the hallways, but it was somewhat amusing, especially after a night out in town!Despite the downsides, the overall experience was wonderful and I would highly recommend the hotel to friends. We walked by the Roommate Alicia which is also at a great location in Huertas, but I would anticipate that the noise from the buzzing plaza and late night party-ers could be a problem. The Mario was very quiet and just a delight!

<Content>Decent hotel, convenient location Friendly staff, great location, very clean, excellent breakfast options, plenty of pillows, and good amenities (wireless internet, fresh fruit, etc).2 downsides (but would not necessarily prevent me from staying in the future)-Do not expect a Westin heavenly bed... mattress is a typical budget hotel slab.-Lighting is all or nothing. Sometimes in the evening one just wants a small lamp or corner light. Would be nice to install dimmers or separate the desk lamp from the vivid ceiling spotlights.

<Author>,,,,
<Content>Great value I stayed at this hotel for a week. Initially for work and then hubby joined me for the wend. The room was small - especially when staying for so long. But it was very clean and had everything you needed. Reception staff were great - really helpful booking restaurants  taxis. Breakfast is good - just cold. But if you arrive later on, things will be limited. Its also rather a hectic experience so not the most relaxing start to the day. It is a shame they dont do room service or evening meals - back late after work and on my own I didn't always want to go out - but i knew this before i booked. The location is great. Near the shops. And Plaza Oriente is lovely for a quiet drink. Definitely recommended.Mr  Mrs B

<Content>Nice hotel, reasonable price, funky decor! I spent 2 nights here in October. I've stayed in Madrid a few times before and this is the best hotel so far regarding location relative to price/standard of accomodation (I've paid more for inferior accomodation).The hotel decor is interesting - a kind of groovy, funkadelic, 60's/70's style, man! But don't let that put you off. Navigating your way around the corridors was also a bit confusing. The room was large, clean and comfortable with good facilities, but I believe all the rooms vary somewhat in size  layout.I found the staff very helpful, and the receptionist spent time choosing  discussing the best room for me when I arrived. I ended up with a room looking out into the central courtyard, but she said this was one of the better rooms. I thought the location was excellent - central but with a very relaxed feel to the area (by Madrid standards). Plaza de Oriente is a great place to stroll around in the evening and stop for a drink. The Palacio Real is also nearby - visit this to see groovy, funky decor from a different era entirely!!

<Content>Great location, great value, great service, awsome breakfast We had a 2 day visit to Madrid on our way to Valencia for a longer stay. As I was planning my trip I saw a show in the Travel Channel that featured this hotel. I had not heard of it before. The recommendation was excellent, and in reading the reviews in Trip Advisor we decided to book. We were not disappointed. We had a great location near the Opera, Plaza Mayor, Chocolateria San Gines (best churros), and with a metro station nearby to get you to Reina Sofia and Thyssen Museums and more. It was a great value, with great service, and an awsome breakfast buffet included. Everything was presented beautifully, made fresh on-site, and frequently replenished by the lovely staff. I dream of that breakfast everyday. An example of great service - we arrived early morning in Madrid after an overnight flight. I called the hotel from the airport asking for an early check-in. Cristiano said it would be difficult to accomodate as they were full, but he would see what could be done. We did not have our hopes up. But upon arrival Cristiano had found a room, and we were so happy to be able to take a hot shower and have a place to leave our luggage before we went out exploring Madrid. We had room 18, which was right next to the breakfast room. We were not bothered by any noise, but then again we are not light sleepers. Room 18 had two windows facing the quiet street the hotel entrance is on. It was mostly white with modern fixtures. It was compact but comfortable. We basically just used it to shower and sleep, as there is too much fun to be had in Madrid. Just one inconvenience was the amount of water collected on the bathroom floor by the toilet during a shower, as there was only a half-glass wall separating the shower from the toilet. I am definitely recommending this place to my friends visiting Madrid.

<Content>Nice Hotel Stayed here for two nights while in Madrid to see Bruce Springsteen. The hotel is nice enough. Its quite contemporary which I like. It does feel slightly cheap but it is very good value. Some of the fittings in the room could be better quality but for the price its very goodLocation is great, up a quiet street off the Teatro Real. No noise at night at all. Very friendly staff, and a lovely breakfast made it a fine base to see Madrid. Didnt like the very thin curtains, which were also white. It was ok in gloomy November, but can imagine they are pretty useless in summer.

<Content>Thumbs Up.....But We booked this hotel based on the Tripadvisor reviews. Basically the reviews were pretty much on target but there were some caveats. First the good news: the hotel is marvelously located within walking distance of the Metro as well as many important sites and next door to a really lively and wonderful restaurant. The staff is universally superb, willing to help with any questions, totally unpretentious, down to earth and always ready to go the extra distance, answer questions and provide assistance. We were not particularly needy but when we needed them they were always there for us. The breakfasts are wonderful......the best croissants we've ever tasted in many years of travel and lots of other goodies as well. To call this a continental breakfast is an injustice. It's a delightful spread, albeit all cold, and everything is fresh, appetizing and delicious. The free hookup for the laptop is also a very nice plus and it was very fast and easy to get going.Now the bad news: our room, facing a courtyard, was considered to be one of the larger rooms. I just cannot imagine the smaller rooms. We constantly were banging our feet onto the plastic chair at the computer table since there was just no place to walk around it. The room was just too small. The mattress was very hard and uncomfortable and it was hard to get the lights dim enough to read before drifting off to sleep. The room was too well lit with no soft lights near the bed. There was also a step from the bathroom into the bedroom which we were concerned about. An easy way to break an ankle and a real danger. They were not very generous with the daily refills of amenities. We got one laundry bag which was not nearly anough for a 6 night stay. No matter how minute a piece of soap we left, it would be there for us when we returned in the evening. Supplies seemed to be rationed out very parsimoniously. And we were told to recycle our towels if possible but this was never possible since the towels were always needed to mop up from the shower which was not enclosed (although ours was in the bathroom and not in the room as others have reported). And, despite the descriptions of designer decor, our room was very sterile looking, without any charm, almost like a hospital room, functional but not attractive or welcoming.All in all, the Mario had pluses and minuses but it is far from dirt cheap. It cost us almost $1,000. for a 6 night stay in November, not the busiest time of year. Perhaps we could have done better.

<Content>Room-Mate Mario (Madrid) was worth it! we absolutely loved pretty much everything about this place - great location, very friendly staff, amenities were wonderful, beds were great (clean and firm), staff wonderful, etc., etc. The breakfast was incredible - best in all our travels - fresh fruit, great coffee, wide selection, a dining room with a very pleasant view - more nice staff always re-stocking the table, very clean (again!). Free Internet access and multi-language TV were nice touches, too.A couple of drawback, which were minor to us, but could be problematic to others:walls were pretty thin; if you're a ligth sleeper, know that you may hear people in other rooms opening closet doors, etc.Showers - ours needed proper caulking - the hotel is new, but already there was minor water damage around teh floor of teh shower (room 221); also, drain was a bti slow.We would recommend this hotel without hesitation - we had a great stay in a centrally-located hotel.

However the decor is already a bit run down (despite the hotel being fairly new), so don't think this is another Hotel Jazz (the one in Barcelona) in Madrid. The staff was very nice, and the breakfast was good. Overall pretty ok but not the fantastic experience others described.

Hotel was full of character delightfully Spanish without the glitz of the Costa's.Whenever a request was made to the staff they were incredibly helpful and there local knowledge was invaluable. If you stay in Granada go to the restaurant - La Huerto Juan Ranas just below the Playa St Nicholas. Loveley food with the best view I have I ever had.

<Content>Very unique. Property was great, staff was great. Checked in at late hour and everything was handled very smoothly. Room was soothing despite being very modern in its decor. Only wish breakfast was served a bit earlier (in most other cities on my trip it started at 6 or 6:30 am) -- but nothing else seems to be open in Madrid at an early hour, so that probably can't be helped. Would stay here again.

<Content>Mario Average I stayed at the Room Mate Mario for 7 nights, as I was in Madrid for a conference. The room was clean, the service was reasonably pleasant. The location (near the Opera Metro) is excellent. The English of some of the staff was not very good and made things difficult at times. The breakfast was fine, but after day 2 was tiresome as it was exactly the same thing each day. The wireless internet went down for the last two days of my stay - that was a HUGE problem as I required it for my work - but the staff didn't seem bothered by this and it still was not working by the time my stay was over.

<Content>Fabulous! This hotel was excellent. I am unable to find even a small negative. From the minute you walk in to the foyer with its funky black and red decor and fabulously friendly staff you feel at home. Each floor is decorated in a different colour scheme - ours was red. There were funky red lights everywhere and our room was painted in a groovy red design. The room was extremely comfortable and the breakfast was fabulous. The breakfast room was just as funky as the rest of the hotel! The location of the hotel was excellent. I would recommend staying at this hotel without reservation. We spent a month in Europe and this was by far the best hotel we had the pleasure to stay in.

<Content>I am tempted to lie about Mario The problem is that all these glowing reviews could make it more difficult to book into this excellent hotel again. I can't find any fault with my stay at all. I have paid twice as much for hotels in the past and got so much less.The room was spotlessly clean, bed comfortable, shower powerful, towels thick and big. Minibar was well stocked and breakfast was the best buffet breakfast I have seen in a hotel.And then there's the incredibly convenient location. Just a few steps to an underground station and a good range of bars and restaurants nearby. I look forward to coming back or trying more of the Room Mate hotels.

<Content>Every Big City needs this hotel We totally enjoyed our stay at the Mario. The location was perfect, near everything we wanted to see in Madrid, shoping and restaurants. It was less noisy than the hotels we had stayed in Granada and Sevilla which were located in the middle of the cities. The breakfast was great, served from 8a-12n. The rooms were clean and everything worked. The people were very helpful. The only thing I noticed amiss were some light bulbs burned out in the red lobby chandalier. Somehow I can't get very upset about that when everything else was so perfect, right down to the apple free by my bed. The price was right.Thanks, Mario.Ann

<Content>Close but no cigar It's a really cute concept, but it kind of fails upon execution...My door key card let me into someone else's room (my fault...it was late at night and I wasn't paying attention to the room numbering) - they were understandably annoyed and I was freaked out.The shower head holder was broken, so water sprayed everywhere. Not good when it took the better part of 5 minutes for the water to heat up.Room was also kind of noisy - lots of sound from some sort of airconditioning unit outside the window. Although breakfast was great, I don't think I'll be coming back.

<Content>Great experience, fabulous staff! The hotel Mario is a gem in the centre of Madrid. Its location is excellent, very near main shopping and entertainment areas, and within walking distance to fantastic restaurants (I specially recommend Entre Suspiro y Suspiro, just around the corner).The rooms are a bit on the small side, and quite a few of them are interior - although if, like me, you rather spend time OUTSIDE, then if wouldn't be a problem. The restaurant and breakfast are quite nice, and reception area very cool - great music!But the best of it all was the staff. Every member of staff we met was friendly and extremely helpful.I'm already planning my next visit!

<Content>Mario is spot on! Brilliant! Room Mate Mario is a fabulous hotel, right next to Opera metro station! Brilliant access to the airport - takes about 45 minutes by metro and costs 1 Euro per person - fabulous! Close to shops, restaurants and about 25 min amble from Prado and Reine Sofia museums.Our room was very clean, neat and very funky! The decor is just fantastic - bright murals on crisp, white walls. The room was at the back of the hotel, so was very quiet. Lovely bathroom with great towels and custom toiletries. You might need to watch out with the shower because if the shower head is not pointed straight down in the cubicle, water splashes all over the bathroom floor!As a welcome, you have crisp apples (!) and a fresh green tea drink waiting for you. We definitely enjoyed the healthy buffet breakfasts which were included in the room rate. Plenty of delicious fresh coffee, cereals, baked goods and fruit really set you up for the day. The staff are really laid back but at the same time, really provide lots of help if needed.The only thing we would warn you about is the funky, plastic chair and desk. Both of us stubbed our toes on the chair legs and ended up with painful, bruised toes. There's not much space around the bed or desk areas, so the layout is perhaps not that easy to move around in.Another bonus is the free Wi-Fi access, brilliant when you're on business! We would definitely stay here again - well worth the money in a beautiful, trendy city. The rate, location and service make it a great place to stay.

<Content>RoomMate Mario is a winner! I stayed at Room Mate Mario Sept. 23-28, 2007. This is a gem of a hotel! I had a small, quiet single in the back with a large , separate bathroom. The room was lovely, with beautiful white bedclothes, huge white towels, and navy blue carpet and accents. The room and hotel are pristine--real modern like a Vogue or W boutique hotel. the breakfast is great and it doesn't end till 12:30 PM, which is good if you're still on some other time. It's less than two blocks from the Palacio Real and the fabulous gardens there and the national theater. It was easy getting from the airport to the hotel on the subway. But going back, I found a route from the Opera station using the Red, Purple and Pink lines because they feature escalators and there's less walking up and down stairs during transfers.The hotel is on a safe, elegant sidestreet that has a used and new bookshop (which features lots of popular paperback in English, probably left by American tourists), a Spanish deli, and a couple of other stores. Around the corner is a well-populated square, with the Opera subway stop right there! Just down the Arenal pedestrian walk (with a zillion stores and restaurants) is the Puerta del Sol subway station and all the activity, department stores, (and., groan..... McD's, KFC, Burger King, Starbucks and all that)...but with plenty of great, inexpensive Spanish restaurants, too.The staff at Mario (give Christiano a holler when you go!) is extremely helpful and friendly. The only downer (slight) was that the American dollar was so low against the Euro when I visited (worth 61 cents!) that my 5 nites ended up costing $950 US, which at almost $200 a nite is no bargain. I would stay at Mario againa and again....despite the unfortunateRoom Mate name, which sounds like some kind of youth hostel.

<Content>Modern, comfortable hotel Good hotel with excellent location in Madrid. The room was comfortable and very modern. There was a slight damp smell in the room which was resolved once the air conditioning unit was turned on. We also found that we got lost a few times in the Alice in Wonderland corridors of the hotel trying to find our room, but once you get the hang of it, it does get easier. There is a great breakfast in the morning and convenient use of the internet. The staff were also very helpful. We were also able to leave our luggage with the hotel after we checked out to do some last minutes sight seeing which was very handy.

<Content>Loved Room Mate Mario Great location! We could walk to everywhere from here and we were close to the Opera Metro Stop if we wanted to take the Metro or buses. The staff were friendly and helpful in making dinner suggestions and booking cabs, etc. The breakfast was great, lots of different choices and the coffee was nice and strong! It also went until 12N which was great for those late nights in Madrid. The rooms were small but clean. The only negative was the bathroom is actually not a spearate room but separated by some foggy glass. The shower door did not close all the way so it was hard keeping water from getting all over the floor. Not alot of privacy from your room mate if you care about that. Would definitely stay here again, felt like we were at someone's house and not a big major hotel. Lots of local bars/restaurants nearby.

<Content>Stay Here! This was definitely a great choice for a mid-priced hotel in Madrid. Centrally located we found that we could walk everywhere we needed to go, including all museums. The hotel staff was so helpful, highlighting maps and phoning in dinner reservations for us. We arrived at the hotel at 7:00 a.m. and check in wasn't until 2:00 p.m. The hotel clerk made a great effort to get us one of our two rooms early. It was so nice after a 12 hour flight not to have to wait for hours to check in. Free high speed internet in the lobby as well as an excellent breakfast buffet made our stay even better. The hip atmosphere is entertaining and the rooms are clean and spacious. We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Stayed at the Alicia twice in August, first in a standard room and then in a duplex suite. On both occasions the hotel surpassed all expectations. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful with a fun attitude and the hotel is beautifully designed and furnished. The standard room had great views across the Plaza de Santa Ana from the full length windows, . The room itself was stylish and it was a nice touch to have the shower incorporated in the bedroom space. We returned five days later to spend four nights in a duplex suite. The suite can only be described as fantastic. Both floors are tastefully decorated and it has two LCD tvs, CD player, electric blinds and a huge bath. However the real WOW factor was the roof terrace, it is huge, with views across the Plaza, It has a double sunlounger, teak settees and coffee tables, shower and black tiled plunge pool. It was the perfect private space to relax while still being in the very centre of the city. The only place to stay when in Madrid.

<Content>Mario in Madrid...highly recommended We have just returned from a weekend at Room Mate Mario in Madrid. The hotel was easily located from the metro using the website directions and the hotel signage easy to spot from the roadside. On entering the hotels cool lobby you are confronted with sleek lines and a hip contemporary feeling reception area. On the whole we found the staff to be attentive and helpful (although a slight hiccup on the first night when there were a few communication issues with the receptionist on duty). The corridors on each floor are lit differently with blue and pink wall panels that guide you to your room which was also well signposted. We were impressed with our room as it was modern and unfussy with a mini bar and safe and a view of the surrounding area. The website describes the bathroom as being 'uncommon' which it certainly is and definitely not for the faint hearted. Our bathroom was on a plinth area and was really just a Perspex box opposite the bed housing a shower and toilet. So it is definitely an intimate experience with your bedfellow (who is able to see your outline when the light is on)! Breakfast was from 08.30 鈥?12.00 noon, hot and cold food was plentiful and replaced as soon as it started running low. The range was fantastic and catered for any palette and involved a lovely continental spread with cheeses, fruit, pastries and meats etc 鈥?it set us up for the day ahead. The dining area was again very contemporary and clean and there was enough space to relax ourselves into the morning.Overall I would say this is probably the best located hotel in Madrid and a great base for exploring the magnificent old city. We would recommend a visit to both Room Mate Mario and Madrid.

<Content>Truly excellent boutique hotel - highly recommended I booked rooms from the hotel's website for a party of 14 visiting Madrid. The website was well laid out  allowed me to look at  get a feel for the hotel.The rooms were very comfortable, stylishly decorated, well equipped  air conditioned. Myself  my friend had the junior suite, which I can highly recommend. The room layouts are a little quirky (e.g sink in the room, frosted glass walls to the bathroom/toilet), but this did not detract from our enjoyment.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, recommending  booking restuarants, arranging cabs, recommending bars.The location of the hotel is also very good, close to the Opera Metro line  only a short walk from Gran Via, Royal Palace, the theatre.The cost of staying in the junior suite was just over 100 euros for 2 nights - a bargain.In short - if you want great value, a beautiful hotel  friendly and efficient service - Mario is your man.

<Content>This hotel is a MUST!! Relaxing, quiet and excellent staff. If visiting Granda, you MUST stay in this hotel. This hotel has everything going for it! Brilliant, central location, quiet, beautiful, spotless and excellent , friendly staff. The hotel is filled with character and has been decorated very tastefully. It is so peaceful and has an immediately relaxing influence as soon as you arrive. The attention to detail is second to none and the room was very large. We had a lovely view of the Alhambra Palace, which was a joy. On the final night of our 10 day tour of Spain, we managed to forget our camera in the taxi in Granda.I had the taxi drivers details, so the evening reception guy was brilliant and managed to get the camera back to me for the next morning! We were so pleased and couldn't have asked for better hotel staff. If going to Granada, you will be mad not to stay at this great hotel! We loved it and will recommend to all our friends.PS. A TIP: If coming by car, the parking arrangements can be confusing. There are two car parks with almost identical names, opposite the road from one another... however, the discount that you get from the hotel is only 1 Euro a day! Daily rate of parking is 15 Euros. The hotel paid for our taxi to the hotel, but not on departure and back to the carpark... no big deal, but thought we'd mention it!

I had Duplex suite 401 which was lovely-very luxurious and very spacious over 2 levels- but I could hear the busy Plaza down below during the night. If you stay in the hotel ask for a room at the back away from the plaza. My friends had rooms 209 and 309 and they couldnt hear the plaza at all. I would certainly stay in this hotel if I was to return to Madrid.

<Content>outstanding hotel in a great madrid neighborhood It is a small hotel on the corner of a very active square about 4 blocks from the Prado. There is activity on the square with multiple restaurants and bars. There are numerous very good restaurants within 3 or 4 blocks of the hotel. The staff speak English very well and were friendly. The room is small but looked exactly like the picture on the internet. We had room 107 that was not facing the street. There were double paned windows that may be ok facing the very busy square that stays very active until late. We thought the traffic noise in Madrid would be like Italy so we asked for an interior room. However, nobody honks their horn and the motor scooters are much quieter than Italy, so the interior room may not be necessary. The room was small but not as small as rooms we have stayed in Rome or Paris. Extremely clean and in very good condition. The bed was two singles pushed together, and were very comfortable, this from a very highly critical evaluator. The breakfast is served in the restaurant on the bottom floor and was excellent, the best we have had in Spain. An extremely good value for Madrid in an excellent location. By the way, the Westin is two blocks away.

<Content>Good value for Madrid This is a great boutique hotel which compares very favorably to higher starred establishments in Madrid. The location is very central - just steps away from the Opera metro station and the Palacio Real, and about 10 minutes' walk from the Gran Via and Sol. However, it is situated in a narrow, quiet street. I had a standard room, but it was clean and spacious with a rather large bathroom. A decent breakfast was included in the price, and served buffet-style in the breakfast room (until noon on weekdays, and 1 pm on weekends - suitably civilized hours for a vacation in Madrid!). Reception staff were young, but very helpful and friendly, and spoke perfect English. Sure, there was no restaurant or bar or swimming pool or gym - but all the night life, sights, and restaurants were only moments away from the hotel. I had friends who were staying in a much more expensive boutique-style hotel nearby, and Mario room-mate was in no way inferior to their accommodation. If catching a cab to the Hotel, just ask the driver to stop at the Teatro Real (Opera House) or it is just as convenient to get the metro to Opera. This hotel chain is opening a new establishment in Chueca (Oscar Room-mate). It wasn't quite ready to open when I was in town, but it looked great from the outside.

<Content>Xlent service! My family had booked 5 rooms early July 2007 to attend to my brother麓s wedding in Madrid. The first morning of our stay, the day before the wedding, two of the family members got health problems (minor, we found out afterwards). The personnel gave fantastic service to us during the whole stay, from arranging medical service to change of rooms, free fruit and drinks and most important of all, showing concern!This hotel is really to be recommended, not only for the great service but also the rooms, design and location.

Very professional and with a lot of empathy for us as their guests. Within our group there were some health problems. The full staff dealt with those problems in a very professional and friendly manner. We definatly recommend this hotel for a stay in Madrid. Superb location, great rooms and the people........ truly fantastic.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Great Value Great hotel, centrally located, and very clean. We were impressed by the value, especially in a large city. I had my 10 month old son with me who is crawling, and I never worried about the cleanliness- which to me was worth a lot. Ultra modern, which I am not a huge fan of, but well done. Staff was great, and breakfast was good. I would definitley stay here again!

<Content>My New Hotel in Madrid Room Mate Mario is a great choice in Madrid for either business or leisure. In short, 'it does what it says on the tin.' LocationExcellent location in Madrid center within walking distance of all the sties. The location is not bad for business, as taxi are readily available in the adjacent square. HotelThe lobby is smart and inviting. I recieved a warm welcome from the woman at the front desk who checked me in. There's a nice sitting area off the lobby, and the 'living room' on the first floor where breakfast is served, but is open throughout the day. RoomThe room I recieved was basic and clean, with nice design features. Free wifi throughout the hotel is a nice touch. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom had everything I needed, also presented with some nice design elements. If you're looking for super delux, this obviously isn't for you. But if you like to stay at a smart hotel, in a good location with prompt and friendly services then it's a good bet for you.One note -- I do wish they'd change the name a bit... Room Mate Mario makes it sound like a hostal...

<Content>Location, location, location A short walk from the Opera metro stop this hotel is superbly situated. Helpful staff and tasteful decor and tidy rooms. Food is ok - nothing flash but adequate. However only small drawback is if you stay in a room which is on the main street frontage you have to put up with a lot of noise both of revellers going home and street cleaning staff at work !! To avoid this be a reveller yourself and sleep through it all !! All in all good value for money and would stay there again.

<Content>Fantatstic small hotel Had a brilliant three night stay there over the weekend.A great hotel with lovely buffet breakfast included in the price.The hotel is in a great location,we had no problems with noise as mentioned by a couple of earlier reviewer's,apart from people passing outside our window at various times throughout the night,but I am a notoriously light sleeper anyway,unlike my wife who never heard a thing(as usual),so I wouldn't worry about that. Anyone thinking of booking a trip in Madrid wil do a lot worse than booking this hotel!

The rooms are fine and spotless, the breakfast is great but what really makes the hotel is their fantastic staff who are friendly and willing to give good recommedations for restarants etc.The location is also good, very central and we had 3 rooms in different parts of the hotel and none of us suffered from any of the noise referred to in earlier reviews. - despite us being 40ish year old women.

Rooms are very clean with efficient use of space - modern, funky decor. Breakfast (included) was a varied buffet - cereals, meats, cheeses, hot coffee, juices. Although there was no parking at the hotel, we were able to park at a different hotel near by. Would definitely stay here again and would be willing to try other Room-Mate hotels.

<Content>I Like Mario Good points:Great location (close to the Metro, the Palace, Gran Via, Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor). Very pleasant staff and a good selection at the buffet breakfast. Room (junior suite, room 101) was big and very stylish.Bad points:A little noisy because of the narrow street. Room should have had a CD player (I didn't ask for it because I had no CDs with me!). A wider selection of TV channels would have been nice (my Spanish is not good enough to follow Spanish TV and I got bored of CNN).I would definitely go there again.

<Content>Mario is made for Madrid We (my boyfriend and I) stayed at the Room Mate Mario in Madrid the week before last.This is a great little hotel and and ideal base for exploring Madrid as it is central to Sol, Gran Via and the Palace. It also has the metro station (Opera) just a few hundred yards from its door.We arrived really early in the morning as we had caught the sleeper train from Paris so our room wasn't ready but the staff took care of our bags and checked-us in so we could go off and enjoy a bit of Madrid.The room we were given was on the second floor was a good size with a good size bathroom. The rooms was decorated with butterflys over the headboard. There was a safe in the wardrobe and a flat screen TV. The bed was comfortable but was two twin beds pushed together (which isn't unusual). The only downsides were there was no natural light in the room as we only had a small window which looked out over the central courtyard and was mostly obscured by scaffolding (although all the scaffolding was removed on our last day) and that occasionaly noise from other areas drifted into the room - but nothing too disruptive!. The room was immaculatly cleaned every day.There is free internet access through a terminal in the lobby and WiFi connection in the rooms. The breakfast is included in the price of your room and you certainly get value for money - there was a great range of breakfast delights on offer and it was served from 7:30am until 12pm so you didn't have to rush to get up in the morning! Word of warning - if you do stay here don't lean back on the chairs in the breakfast room - we saw a couple of people literally snap the back of the chair in half!The staff are very friendly and helpful. I would recommend staying at this hotel as a base for exploring Madrid.

<Content>Like a boutique hotel at a fraction of the price First off this hotel looks as good in the flesh as it does in the photos. It's centrally located (but if you are getting the metro from the airport you'll need to change three times but it only costs a Euro and is only about 10 - 15 minutes longer than a taxi which costs about 30 Euros more), the hotel is really clean and the staff were really helpful. The breakfast is really good and really long so if you don't want to get up early it's on 'till 12. However, the builders outside the bedroom window on the scaffolding covering the front of the building, whistling and listening to radio from 7 - did mean that there was an early wake up call each morning. One of the other reviews advised taking ear-plugs, which I would recommend, the hotel does have hard floors and comings and goings in the night can be quite loud at times - the ear-plugs helped with the builders dawn chorus. The room was one of the cleanest I have been in and had its own style and air conditioning, as well as a safe in the wardrobe and a good sized bathroom. The only slight drawback with the room - was that although it was booked as a double it was in fact win beds made up as individual beds and pushed together. This may not be a problem for everyone but if you are looking for a romantic getaway twin beds aren't that great : (Other than that I would highly recommend the hotel to old and young alike.

Location was excellent and when we were there it was quiet. There is scaffolding up on the adjacent building at the moment so road looks a bit of a mess. Seemed a bit expensive but staff were cheerful and bright.

The Hotel is not to big but is greatly located just a couple of Blocks of Palacio Real and Plaza Mayor. The Room we stayed in was very well decorated and kind of small, a good surprise was tha they didn麓t say anything about breakfast being included when we made the reservations but when we arrived it turned out it was , so that was another good surprise, specially because it had a good variety of food. I definitevely recomend this hotel for a good price and ood location.

<Content>Ikea on steriods Pros: The staff was very friendly and helpful. The shower was pretty good. The flat screen TV was small but nice. There is free internet service in the lobby, and there is a great, free breakfast buffet.Cons: There is no separate bathroom; rather, the hotel room was one large room with a toilet area and shower area off to the side. As a result, there was very little privacy for bathroom activities. Other bathroom shortcomings: only one towel was provided (until we called and asked for a second), and there was no kleenex. The beds were rock hard and uncomfortable. The walls were thin and you could hear hallway noise, other people's showers, etc. Lastly, the room was designed with cheap Ikea-like furnishings that were cheap and worn.

<Content>great little hotel Stayed here for three nights, loved the location and thought it was a great deal, as we paid 116 USD per night for double room on Expedia. Room size and bathroom were pretty typical for budget hotel in Europe - tub with mounted hand shower and good water pressure, built in hair dryer, shelf for toiletries, nice tilework and overall design. Room was small, but well lit with flat screen TV. We had two windows, and the apples on the bedside table were a nice touch. Breakfast was 7:30-12:00, and included ham, cheese, fruit, cereal, yogurt, breads, and pastries, as well as a Spanish omelette, and all sorts of coffee, tea and juice. And, unlike some other small hotels I've stayed in, there was actually enough room for everyone in the breakfast room. Staff was friendly, and the location was ideal.

<Content>Noisy Nice venue: smart, sleek and cool. Undoubtedly friendly staff, good breakfasts and a smashing location.But just one, over-arching, annoying problem. The noise.Anyone staying in a street-side room will be affected if there over the weekend. The hotel sits right above a very trendy bar - La Viuda Blanca - which keeps going until three/four in the morning on Fridays  Saturdays.So either stay in the back rooms, or give it a miss altogether. The trendy corridors - without carpets - can also wake you up very early in the morning as staff/visitors get on the move.Not the most relaxing venue: but ok if you're happy to live with a bit of a din. I won't be back, however.

<Content>Really enjoyed our stay at the mario We really enjoyed our stay at the room mate Mario, nice little hotel, very clean, very trendy, we stayed in room 118 which was on the outside of the building, nice size room larger than the one we had stayed in london. The reception asked us if noise would bother us from the street, we said no, not a great deal of noise in February, and walking round madrid all day once our heads hit the pillow we were out like a light. The room was right next to the breakfast room where there was a bit of noise, but it didn't bother us, we could still doze off, and anyway we needed to be up and out, we didn't go to madrid to lie in bed late. Lovely breakfast, the museli was good and toast and juice plus coffee, good selection of meats and cheese if you like that sort of thing, very clean.Great for the tube and just round the back 5 mins walk away was the royal palace. Great location.

<Content>Great location, but noisy I stayed in this hotel for three nights at the start of January. The location is very, very good and I would stay there again because of this. However it is not the perfect hotel. It has very contemporary decor which makes a pleasant change. However, all the trendy timber and steel makes for a noisy place, especially at night when every sound echoes. A woman walking past your room wearing high heels sound like a 21-gun salute. the noise of voices also travels, as do the rumblings of the lift. Also, there is no bar which is a pity as it's nice at night to have someplace to come back to for a nightcap. There is some tricky photography in their web-site, and what looks like a bar is in fact the reception desk!! The breakfast each morning is very nice and the staff are helpful. They have an amazingly low rate to use the bedroom phone. I had to make an emergency phonecall from the room to a mobile in Ireland. This 4 minute call cost me 45cent!!! I asked for this to be checked but was told that this was their rate.....wow! It's a nice place, safe location as well as terribly central. When you exit the metro at Opera, just look for the bright lights of Burger King and it's just a few doors up that side street. It;s spotlessly clean too.

<Content>Marvellous Mario From 14/01/2007 to 19/01/2007We stayed at Room-mate Mario Hotel in Madrid, Spain after reading an article in The Observer newspaper which was very favourable. Also checked out Tripadvisor for reviews (mixed).We thoroughly enjoyed the experience from start to finish. The accommodation was just as advertised - minimalist design and spotlessly clean. We were mucked out every day and clean bedlinen, towels etc., provided. Staff were exceptionally pleasant and rate top marks. The buffet breakfast was all that one could wish for (except a full english) but hey, it had almost everything. There was some street noise but it is a capital city and also there was building work going on outside (scaffolding etc.) but the building workers are the quietest I've ever come across!! I guess the works were going on at this time of year in readiness for the busiest tourist season Spring  Summer but have to say it did nothing to detract from our stay at this lovely hotel. A very central location close to lots of wonderful places to visit (one minute away from the Teatro Real Opera House) in Plaza Isabella II.We enjoyed the whole experience of staying here.

<Content>Great small boutique hotel We had a great time at the Mario. It looked exactly as portrayed in its website, sort of a cross between Ikea and some psychodelic '60s look. The breakfast was great and bountiful, and the staff was extremely helpful both in recommendations and directions. Their English was very good as well. They even let me use their PC to use the Internet.The hotel is well situated, just across from the Opera house and the Metro,and steps from the Royal Palace. We wanted to extend our stay one day, but they were filled up. So we got a reservation across the street at the Hotel Meninas (also very good), and the people at the Mario even carried our luggage to their competitor for us!S. FlansLas Vegas, NV

The breakfast is quite good (buffet style) and open until noon (which you'll need given the lateness of most Spanish dinners.The downside was that the windows block little sound from the street and the hall has bare floors and walls, so every sound is magnified. Bring earplugs and your own alarm clock. Queen size beds are actually two singles pushed together.

<Content>Handy but noisy Having stayed there for one night last week, I was surpirsed that no mention has been made of the noise in other reviews. I stayed in Room 106, which is situated in a corridor without carpet. This meant that every time somone opened or closed a door it was like they'd banged a saucepan next to my bed. As I wanted a sleep in, it was very annoying. At one stage the plumbing also kicked in at a deafening roar.The breakfast was just about adequate but on reflection I would have gone out for something more tasty.Having said all that, it was quite fun staying somewhere so handy and trendy but I think I would choose somewhere else next time.

<Content>Super Mario Hotel Mario is Fab.Perfect location Staff excellent all young and very helpful and extremely friendly explained Metro stops and wht buses to use for the differennt places we wanted to see.The rooms are gorgeous. we had booked 2 for ourselves and our sons 2116.Rooms different boys had a closed in bathroom and slightly smaller but lovely decor and fresh smelling cleaning staff a credit to this hotel everything was spotless. Our room was a lot bigger and overlooking a courtyard which could get a little bit noisy but was so tired after all the walking never really bothered us.Beds very comfy pillows not so but we managed a/c was great as it was extremely warm this week which was lovely Our shower had no door so floor got a bit wet and sink and mirror on the outside in the room.our wardrobe space was limited but boys had loads.

<Content>Yes, it's good Earlier reviews may give the impression that this place is really just for the funky retro-chic (not to say gay) brigade. I'm sure such folk would like it, but we are a solid elderly couple of conservative tastes, and we were very happy to stay there. You would have to be a real devotee of chintz to dislike the d茅cor. Also, the breakfast buffet is ample, the situation is excellent - OK, a fair step from the Big 3 museums, but there's a metro station nearby, and Madrid public transport is seriously cheap. The lovely Plaza de Oriente is just 5 minutes' walk away, and for those who like sustaining food of high quality and low price, the Casa Marta restaurant (C/ Santa Clara) is even closer. No bar in the hotel, though. Well, nowhere's perfect.

<Content>Great hotel! We stayed for 4 nights in September 2006. The hotel is located on a quaint, quiet, cobblestone block in the center of the city, 5 minute walk to the royal palace, plaza mayor and plaza oriente. The location was really terrific. We also walked to the prado - a 25 minute walk. The metro is right on the corner. Rooms are small but very stylish and funky. Staff was helpful. Breakfast was typical European spread. They have one computer with internet access - there usually was not a wait to use it. I booked the hotel directly on their website and got a great deal of 80 euros a night. I recommend this hotel as a really great moderately priced place. It was very clean, decor was fabulous and location superb.

<Content>Mario was PERFECT!!! This hotel is also known as Hotel Campomanes. Very high end looking, sleek, artsy, modern, smelled clean and fresh...and had very inviting desk help each of the 4 days we stayed there.We stayed in Room 201, a HUGE suite facing the picturesque street. We had two huge french door style windows with billowy curtains and a small balcony...great Plasma TV, which my husband loved, very spacious room with sitting area, big closets, and ever so important, a comfortable bed! The A/C worked well too!There was no after hours street noise that we heard...mid morning we could hear the buzz of office employees coming and going but nothing to complain about.The breakfast that was included had a big variety of food choices and their mini chocolate croissants were excellent and so was the fresh squeezed OJ and coffee.The location was excellent! We were just one street off the Opera, which is one street away from The Royal Palace and Plaza Del Oriente. The Opera Metro stop was right there in front of the Opera and any side street leading away took you right to lots of shopping and eating. One of the best places we found to eat was near the entrance to Plaza Mayor, a restauurant called Colonia De Sacramento, which had a great covered terrace eating area and a fun bar inside. The food was yummy and it wasn't over priced liked the Plaza Mayor restaurants.The cafes at Del Oriente were also good and the p;aza was a good spot to people watch in pretty surroundings and write out postcards or journal. We came and went all hours of the night and in the peak of world cup Frenzy and never felt unsafe in this neighborhood or at this metro stop.Hotel Mario was a great Value, super friendly staff, super clean, and we would definitely return! And those with picky teen/kid eaters...there is a Burger King and McDonalds right across from the Opera house!

<Content>Great hotel I stayed at the Mario for a week in July 2006.I had a great time.The hotel is very clean and comfortable. The staff spoke english and were very helpful even printing up maps to give me directions to various sights.The breakfast is very good with a cappucino,coffee and latte machine, fresh fruits,cereals,pastries,yogurts and cake.The beds are comfortable and there is a dryer in the room and there is no extra charge for the room safe.The air conditioning worked well.The room was quiet as the hotel is located on a quiet side street off plaza Isabel.The opera metro stop, is in the plaza. Sol and plaza major are both about 5 mins walk away.There is a delicious nice cream store off the bottom right corner of plaza Isabel.Watch out for pick pockets at Ingles cortez Dept store.I was pick pocketed by 2 well dressed women ~ 30 years of age!

<Content>Good value for the money, perfectly located Room Mate Mario Hotel is perfectly located to discover Madrid.A lot of interesting sites, shops, restaurants and bars are within walking distance. The rooms are very modern and stylish and of a decent size. If you ask for a Kingsize bed you will get two single beds moved together which offer enough space for two tall persons to sleep. Rooms are very well cleaned. Stuff is friendly and helpful.Breakfast is good, nothing fancy but all things available are good and fresh.A very good choice for a 3 star hotel in Madrid.

<Content>boutique, central hotel with parking One of the reasons why I chose the Hotel Mario was due to the favourable reviews on TripAdvisor. Having stayed there for two nights, I would agree with the other reviews - it's very central, very cool in its design and very reasonable. Another plus is the free use of internet facilities in reception. The only drawback would be the noise from the air conditioning, but even then I'd still recommend it as a place to stay. We also used their parking facilities. Hotel Mario uses a car space (I think they only have one) in the nearby Hotel Preciados. We ended up in Plaza Mostenses car park on the other side of the Gran Via (the car park at Plaza St Domingo is undergoing renovation and it looks like it won't be available for abother 18 months). We then walked to Hotel Mario, picked up confirmation that we were staying there and then drove the car from the public carpark over to Hotel Preciados - no easy feat in Madrid traffic! A member of staff in Hotel Preciados parked the car for us in their carpark. It's well worth it though - in Plaza Mostenses I noticed it would have cost us around 鈧?55 per day to leave the car there (and it didn't seem all that safe), whereas leaving it in the Hotel carpark felt far safer and only cost about 鈧?16 per day.

<Content>Very good moderate-priced choice We were very please with our choice of this hotel. The rooms were nicely furnished in a budget design hotel style : 2 out of the 3 rooms our party booked were a decent size but one was rather cramped. Our own one seemed to be the second biggest on the 2nd floor, on the fire drill plan, and it had 2 small balconies on to the street. There was some street noise from late night revellers but not enough to disturb us, although it might disturb others. It was a very narrow, one way street  not busy with traffic. The location was very central  quite good for walking everywhere - very close to the palace, although closer to the big 3 museums might have been a bit better for us. The breakfast was a very good spread and the reception staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. One tip - if taking a taxi back to the airport, ask the staff to book it more than 12 hours in advance as their preferred taxi firm demands that much notice. We didn't  got a real cowboy - the one minus point of a very enjoyable stay. We would stay at this hotel again - at 鈧?05 + 7% VAT per night it was good value.

<Content>Good value. Good location. We booked this hotel having checked the reviews on TripAdvisor. Happy with the choice. Very good location only a minute or so from Opera metro station and less than five minutes walk from the Royal Palace.The hotel has been recently re-modelled in the 'modern' style. The rooms are smallish but not bad for such a central location at this price. Everything very clean and tidy.Staff very helpful. They booked us into a restaurant just over the street as we arrived late on Saturday evening (Restaurant CHIC ... recommended ... good food, reasonably priced and very friendly English speaking staff).Breakfast buffet included in the room rate. Perfectly okay, although limited to the usual cold meats  cheese selection etc.Free WiFi, altho' signal wasn't very good from the bedroom. Worked perfectly from the lobby.Our room looked over a small central courtyard so zero view. Our companions had a room overlooking the street but did say this was noisy ... but then again, no one in Madrid seems to go to bed until 2 - 3 in the morning ...

<Content>Good location, great staff, We stayed in the Mario at the end of January 2006, and would recommend it.Located on a quiet street, we had a room facing the street which was quiet, something that would be difficult to find in many other parts of the town - it's a late night town.Situated just beside the Teatro Real, the Opera metro station and the impressive Palacio Real. Much of the city is an easy walk, with Plaza Mayor and Puerta Del Sol a few minutes stroll from the hotel.Rooms were warm (with A/C) and clean and a good shower with plenty of hot water. The w.c. was a strange shape and a little uncomfortable ... but we didn't go to Madrid to check out bathroom fittings!The staff were great, the breakfast was good and included in the price. We thought also the madrid people were most enjoyable very laid back and friendly. We thought it was good value for money.

Centrally located on a charming street, great bathroom facilities, great breakfast area (although we never got up early enough to use it), gobs of restaurants, tourist attractions, shopping, etc. nearby. Room was tiny but cool. Staff went above and beyond helping us communicate with airline due to our missing luggage, faxing, calling, etc. Plus they gave good directions and suggestions and were very friendly.

<Content>Good Value and Good Looking Whilst the HH Campomanes in Madrid has some small rooms (don't do as we did and accept a small room instead of waiting for ours to be cleaned) it is a stylish boutique hotel in a great location. There was a bit of early morning noise but is that not to be expected in a city that sleeps late? The breakfast was better than most and the coffee excellent. At times it may have tried to be cooler than it needed (the groovy hallways are noisy but the green apples on the bedside tables were sweet) but overall i thought that it was good value for money.

<Content>Awful facilities The HH Campomanes is a designer hotel, and is aesthetically beautiful, but suffers from style over substance. The double room was ridiculously small, barely room for one, let alone two people. The bed was uncomfortable and small too for a double. The shower was appalling, barely any pressure, and the temparature seemed to be freezing or scalding with no in between. The toilet was too tall, and uncomfortable.In summary, go there if you like something unusual to look at, but not if you want to actually use the facilities

<Content>GREAT value for the money My fiance and I stayed here for a long weekend and found the hotel to be great. It was recommended by a friend who lives in Madrid. The location is good, right near the Opera and a main plaza, and the subway. It was a cute neighborhood. The staff was nice, the hotel was clean, rooms are a bit small, but typically European. Continental breakfast was good. We were very happy staying here. Make sure you ask them to make a reservation for dinner at a local restaurant if you are staying Saturday night! Otherwise, you won't be able to get a table.

<Content>Terrible hotel, worst I've seen in years We had an awful experience at Hotel Mario, an unbelievably overpriced 2 star hotel. My husband and I are seasoned travelers (Latin America, Asia, Europe, Canada), have used all types of accomodations from camping/1 star up to 5 star luxury hotels, and feel that this is the worst hotel we've ever stayed at, particularly for the money. We were there during a hot Madrid summer week, and the A/C simply didn't work. Air came out of the vent, but there was nothing cool about it. After we decided to leave because of this problem (we were told by a sweaty desk clerk that the A/C had a problem, and that all rooms would probably be the same), we returned after the weekend to speak with the manager (who apparently doesn't work Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays), who lectured us for a half an hour about how the A/C definitely worked, until he finally realized that he was wrong and, in the end, refunded us our money. This place might be worth it during Spring or Fall for about half the price ($40), but even then something else could go wrong -- it just seems like a crappy hotel with a not very convincing coat of paint covering the flaws.

<Content>Excellent design hotel in central location Campomanes (it is also called Hotel Mario on here, although was never referred as that during our stay) is an excellent choice if you prefer a little design in your hotel. The rooms are small but so are most hotel rooms in Spain. We found it quite comfortable and the staff was more than helpful, recommending restaurants and sites to see. We were in an interior room with a light-well, so I can't say if the other street rooms would be noisy. The hotel breakfast was great too, good to start the day. Bathrooms were clean and efficient. It's not a plush, luxurious place. Just a simple, well-designed, modern hotel in an old part of town, close to the Gran Via, the Opera and the Royal Palace.One note: There is a very trendy restaurant next door. The food was good, but the service was capricious at best. Unless you're into the typical star-f**ker dining experience just skip it. The people (like a lot of Madrilenos) think they're so damn fabulous for absolutely no reason.

<Content>Small, chic but a tad noisy! This hotel is a real find. (Actually called Hotel Camponanes.) The decor and overall feel of the hotel is something that you don't expect from a hotel of this price range. The staff are courteous and English speaking (quite a find in Madrid!). The rooms are clean and well stocked and the maids do a thorough job. The breakfasts are great, tea, coffee, juice, fresh pastries, cereals, yoghurts, cakes, cheeses and meats and they serve until 10am.Situation wise the hotel is perfect; close to the Plaza de Orient and the Palace - perfect for an afternoon beer in the cafes which circle the plaza itself.The drawback to this hotel is the noise. We stayed in the 'suite' on the 2nd floor. Each morning the street cleaners set to work at 6am and Spanish workers do no have any idea how loud they talk. We were woken each morning by someone screeching 'Manuel'! Furthermore there was building work down the road, which then started at 7am. After a good night out, we were left pretty tired and definately needed the infamous siesta! Our suite had large balcony windows, which although beautiful are not the most sound proof. Ear plugs are recommended.With ear plugs, or the ability to sleep soundly through noise, this place is perfect. Really good value.

It was quite loud. When they moved us to a street facing room, the noise was worse although the view of the Piazza was nice.When our luggage was delivered and we enquired about it, the front desk said it hadn't arried when it had been there for 7 hours plus. Thus, the customer service is lacking.The location is good and the breakfast was excellent.

<Content>One for Ikea fans The lobby is comparable to a boutique hotel, with black marble and it makes a great first impression. However, the rooms do not quite match the quality of the rest of the hotel. Ikea Madrid clearly did good business when they fitted out this place! The rooms are stylish, but some of the fittings are starting to look a bit dated and frayed around the edges. However, the hotel was being refurbished whilst we were visiting so these points may be addressed. On the plus side, the location is excellent, right in the centre of Madrid, the staff all spoke English and the rooms were very clean. For 鈧?9 including a decent breakfast, the value can not be faulted.

<Content>View on lightwell This hotel has 30 rooms, out of which 25 have views on lightwells and five on the street. These lightwells are approximately 3m by 3m wide and they certainly do not qualify as internal courtyards. So if you want to know the weather outside you can check it through internet thanks to the flat screen in the bedroom.Do not trust them if they guarantee you a room on the street. In my case I had a guarantee for a room on a high floor with a view. I got a room on the first floor with a lightwell. When I reserved, they never bothered to tell me that no room had views, and that the best you can have is a room on the street.In the 19th century area of Madrid, there are plenty of hotels similarly priced (鈧?9 per room) with excellent natural lighting, and they do not try to deceive you on what you get.

<Content>Enjoyable experience at HH. My wife and I stayed 3 nights at the HH Campomanes. It is a smaller hotel with a contemporary feel. Not a lot of amenities but a nice hotel. The staff was courteous and efficient. We arrived around 12 noon and our room was ready. The minimalist decor is good. PROS: Location - right near the Palacio Real. A few steps from the Opera metro station. A great contemporary restaurant right next door (Vida Blanca). Good continental breakfast. Price (99 euros per night with breakfast) through their internet site.CONS: They charge 3 euros per day for the in room safe. Small shower. No bar which would be nice in the lobby to enjoy the cool lobby area, which otherwise goes unused.I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, should be ranked higher This hotel is a few steps from the Opera station which is extremely convenient. That means its walking distance to the Plaza Mayor, Palace Real and Puerto del Sol and some other tourist attractions. The hotel has a very modern feel. It seems newly renovated although they could have done a better job sound proofing the rooms cause we could hear people in the hallways loud and clear. We were in room 205 which was quite small, bascially enough room to hold a double bed. However, for 99 euro a night including breakfast, we thought it was a good deal. I would definately recommend this hotel. Madrid is a nice city, but I think it could be done in 2 days. Save more time for Barcelona.

<Content>disaster in Madrid (hh Campomanes) a disaster experience. When we arrive, our room was not prepared. After waiting a long time, like 30 minutes or more drinking a bad coffee, we were said that they not have the room (that we reserved 2 months ago) and they will move us to a another hotel, of more stars...that麓s what we were said, but they moved us carrying with all our baggage and walking to a hotel near the plaza, nothing compared with the original one. a disaster. In four days we were not be able to enjoy even a day in our reserved hotel because they said they had a problem with the reservations. we traid to speak with a manager or a responsible person of the hotel and we speak the chief reception called Julio and he could never explained why we where not enjoying our stay in our orginal hotel reserved 2 months ago. In a very bad english, and with a rude way of speaking to us instead of solving us the problem. well, in conclusion a real real disaster. we were charged in the hotel but we stay in another one, nothing to do with the original one. I could never recommend this one. I麓m sorry hh campomanes.

<Content>aka HH Campomanes - wonderful experience Lovely contemporary hotel right in the heart of central madrid. Across the street from the Opera Metro stop, near Plaza Isabell II. What a great location!! Within walking distance to Teatro Real, Puerto Del Sol etc. Calle Arenal is a great shopping street with some neat nightclubs. The rooms are great with individual a/c -heating, and 2 comfy twin beds. No noise whatsever. Rooms include minibar and staellite TV with internet access planned. The bathrooms are extremely clean, with hot running water. Housekeeping turns out the sheets and toiletries daily. The staff are very friendly, and speak good english. They have good info on local events / tourist stops, and can help you buy tix to operas / shows / flamencos etc.Breakfast buffet is included and has: 4 types of cereals, fruit juice/milk/water, sliced cakes, bread with sliced meats (turkey, ham etc) and cheese, fresh fruits, yogurt and criossants. Breakfast is open from 8am-10:30am, and a good stint here keeps you tucked in well until the 2pm Madrid lunchtime. We stayed there for 4 nights over the christmas break, and loved it. All this comes at a price though, and at 99 Euro a night it is not the cheapest place around. But it is definitely a really good value for the money! We would gladly recommend it to others. One tip - if you want to do your own laundry, there is a coin operated laundromat (LavaMat) off Calle De La Cruz very close to Puerto Del Sol. The hotel will only dry-clean your clothes, and it's not worth the price. They also will not tell you about the coin op laundry for obvious reasons.

<Content>Just come back from a long weekend there - recommend two local restaurants too We've this day just returned from this hotel (still called HH Campomanes as at today's date). Yes, its very quiet (even with the window open you can hear just the vaguest of murmurs of motor bikes - presumably everybody else in other nearby hotels can hear these full blast). The air conditioning is excellent (yes, even in October you need this). The rooms are small, but they have everything you need except tissues. Nice LCD television with CNN and Eurosport.Going for breakfast is like entering a Dr Who set. On the way in you expect to see a Dalek meeting you in the corridor which is a bit worrying. But I also noticed everybody seems to glide around at breakfast, no doubt effected by the same feeling. It gives a new meaning to Buenos Tardis if you are late for breakfast. By the way if you plan to eat the excellent muesli, don't sit on the couch for breakfast - it's too low.One very good thing about the hotel is its location, 5 mins walk to the palace (watch the sunset during your aperitif), or to the impressive Plaza Mayor, or to the large stores on Gran Via, or the hectic activity of Plaza del Sol and Plaza Santa Ana.Which brings me to the restaurant recommendations. If you arrive at 9.50pm, you will get in for dinner just before the locals who pile in at 10pm on the dot. We found two good places off the tourist main routes. AlNorte in San Nicolas: modern decor, all wines between 10 and 15 Euros, excellent fish dishes and meat. It was a bit rushed - ask for extra time if you need it. The highlight of the weekend was Gastronomia in C. Santiago. There is no menu outside but don't be put off. It seems to be modern Spanish cuisine with a small hint of Japanese influence. The menu inside is indecipherable unless you have fluent Spanish but luckily we had ours translated into English for us by (I believe) one of the owners. The wine list is to die for and it has a floodlit cellar undeneath. Let them recommend a wine but you will be asked how much you want to spend. We said 20 Euros which produced an excellent wine which went superbly with the meal. These two restaurants are to the West of Plaza Mayor off Calle Mayor.

<Content>Loved this design hotel Loved this hotel - great design! Color schemes were cool - white/black with splashes of red. Lights in hallways would turn on automatically (sensor). Clean room, great breakfast. Location so convenient - 3 minute walk to Royal Palace  right next to Opera metro.

<Content>THE hotel in Madrid The hotel was more than Perfect. The location, in a very tiny and quiet street, just in the center of all the more interesting places and shops of madrid. The best, was the staff, who recommend to us only the best to shop, eat, go out... always with an smile to receive you and say you YES to all. very clean, modern, it was fabulous. I really recommend this one, I will come back again, cheap, good, nice.

<Content>Strongly recommended Stayed here in June 2004 and thoroughly recommend it. Perfect location, 2 minutes walk from Opera Metro station but we hardly even had to use the metro because most places were walkable - 10 minutes walk to Puerta del Sol. Loads of shops, restaurants and bars nearby. Nice modern, clean room and spotless bathroom with large soft towels (unusual for a hotel of this price). Breakfasts were great - self service with selection of fresh fruit, yoghurts, rolls, bread/toast, croissants ham, cheese, selection of fruit juices, teas, coffees, etc. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Only minor complaint was that on 2 out of our 3 days the hot water was luke warm and made for a refreshing shower to say the least! Still, we loved Madrid and would definitely stay at HH Campomanes again.

<Content>Location  Stayed here in May 2004. Location is good, near the Teatro Real, 5 minute walk to Palacio Real, a 10 minute walk to Plaza Mayor. I like the location since it's in the older part of town. It's a small hip hotel, rooms are varying sizes. First time we stayed here the room was of decent size, stayed here after returning from seville and they booked us at a much smaller room where we could hardly move around. I did get a peek at another room and this time it was like a suite! I checked their rates and all doubles are euro99 (no prices for suites so I assume it's just a matter of luck if you get that room). Room is minimalist-- tv is screwed above the bed so can be quite uncomfortable if watching for a long time. Bathroom also clean though sometimes the towels had holes (I'm a bit finicky). Breakfast is free- self service, just a few steps from the reception area, you get croissants and some other kinds of bread which you can heat in the toaster they provide. The receptionist was trying to be helpful but always harassed since there is only one person there. Be sure to get a confirmation since they gave our room away even after we gave them our credit card # to reserve a room after we got back from Seville. One tripadvisor was right, they overbook and they just refer clients to a hotel down the street. Housekeeping a bit dodgy. We checked in and they still didnt clean our room (at 4 in the afternoon). Reception said to come back in 15 mins so they can clean our room. I shudder to think what kind of cleaning they would do for only 15 mins when the room was a mess after the previous guest stayed there. Still, eur99 seemed pretty inexpensive for the location and the rooms are fairly clean...

<Content>Great location, modern rooms but small My husband and I just spent four nights in this hotel and couldn't have been more pleased. The location is fabulous - a one block walk to the Opera metro station, two blocks from the Royal Palace. The common areas and the rooms are particularly modern. The first room we were given was so small the two of us had a tough time navigating around each other. But we asked at the front desk for a larger room our last three nights and they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite. A room more than twice as large - a real haven to come home to after a long day of touring. Most helpful staff, breakfast buffet in the morning. A great base for Madrid touring. We would definitely come back - and stay in a larger room!

<Content>Cute hotel, small rooms Overall our stay here was pleasant. The hotel is in a fabulous location, central to so many things, yet located on a small, quiet street. Our room was quite tiny, hard to walk around in with the luggage in the room. The carpet has seen better days, perhaps a good cleaning would do the trick. Everything else was clean, nice bathrooms. However I didn't feel like it was a good value. While I would stay here again, I would probably try to find a better deal. It seems I've read reviews of much nicer places for only a little more money. We booked through innsofspain for 99鈧?
