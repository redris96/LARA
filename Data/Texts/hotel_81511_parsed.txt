<Content>Don't do it! Four of us (2 couples) were on a one month trip in the southwest U.S. We prebooked all our hotels and BBs and this was our choice in San Francisco because of the price and the location. We did not expect the Hilton but we sure didn't expect this. We booked two rooms for three nights and the comments apply to both.The room was old, well worn carpet and furniture that appeared filthy in the poor lighting. The bathroom was moldy in the shower, around the ceiling and on the floor. There was no toilet paper holder in the bathroom and when we complained they said it would be done the next day (wrong). I went to the office which was under renovation to borrow a screwdriver to do my own repair in the room and was directed to the maintenance man in the breakfast room. He was sitting at a table with his feet on the table drinking a beer but did manage to find a screwdriver. Needless to say we didn't eat the complimentary breakfast in that room.The bed was clean and comfortable, but that is the extent of the good comments.Parking was another problem and we ended up parking off the premises around the corner at a restaurant as the lot was continually full.We found another hotel and booked out early as we just couldn't manage to stay any longer.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Very good location. Room a little dated and on the small side but functional. Bathroom on the small side with older fixtures. Overall good experience. Advise you park the car and use public transportation. You will find that parking in SF is expensive and almost impossible to find.

<Content>Location is no excuse! So the location is good but thats as far as i would go. The linen was dirty, the fridge was filthy and falling apart and the room made my skin crawl. Cheap is no excuse for failing to provide basic hygienic conditions. Avoid.

<Content>Better than expected We, two adults and a nine years old child, stayed at the Travelodge at Presidio on the 13th of July for three nights.After a warm welcome to the reception staff we entered our room that was the once located to the street side, The noise of the traffic was audible in the room but it was in an acceptable scale. The motel is located in that part off Lombard St. directly near Presidio with only a little traffic compared with the more troubled part a few hundred feet away. Our room was clean, not small but also not very spacious. Usually every room has an own parking lot. But not in this motel. There are less parking lots than rooms in the inner courtyard. Breakfast in the very small lobby was more than poor. Only coffee, cereals, and some kind of sweet soft cookies. The only change to eat or drink something was to put the whole stuff on a tray and took it with you to your room.Our son had a small infection at one eye so we had to go to a doctor. The staff at the reception was very courteous and did everything to help us.Conclusion: Despite of some lack the motel is a good location for exploring SF. An further advantage is the short distance to the Golden Gate Bridge. We would stay at this motel again.

<Content>Will stay there again Stay there with my family four nights. Small rooms, old building yet clean and almost everything runs pretty well. The front desk clerks were friendly and very helpful. They did everything they promised. Location is good for tight budget tourists. #45 bus terminal station is only one block away. Not far from the Crissy field and Palace of Fine Art. Hiking to the Golden Gate bridge is also not difficult for young children. My biggest problem during stay is internet access, most of the time it won't work and the manager on duty told me it's the internet service provider's problems, they can't solve it.

<Content>great location for the budget traveler Dates 6/24-6/28Spent four days in san fran and was able to do just about everything on foot from this location. (we are in our early 50's) It is literally at the entrance to the Presidio (which is beautiful). Within walking distance of the marina (view of golden gate) then just up a scenic walk to fishermans wharf. If you walk straight up lombardo (and I mean up) you can access the crookedest street. One night we took a cab from fishermans wharf (too much happy hour) and it was only 8.00! Our room was old, bed linens were comfortable but exceptionally clean. New AC/heating had just been installed. Bathroom fan was extremely noisy so we just used the heating light most of the time. Not enough vanity space so I utilized the coffee area for hair/make up. People at the desk were extremely helpful. Continental breakfast was packaged rolls, cereal, milk, juice and coffee. Low water pressure, lots of hot water. Area felt safe even at night. Got a great package deal via travelocity. Well what can I say-definitely not a ritz carlton but I am sure it saved us a lot in transportation. Parking was not an issue on the days we stayed as we did have a rental car-just never used it. Average budget motel-great location.

<Content>Nice enough for SF. We needed a place for the whole family for graduation. Since living in SF for 3 years, we knew how difficult it would be to place the whole family and make sure there were things to do in a relatively safe neighborhood. We picked the Presidio area because there was the Exploratorium and Golden Gate Bridge for the kids, Chestnut street for food, and the hotel had free parking. The price was decent for SF ~$100/nt. I booked 2 rooms off their website and 2 directly through the staff. Be cautious because if you book thru the website, you can't claim the AAA discount since they are sold thru a 3rd party. The first room we got was in the process of a remodel and smelled like heavy paint. They told us they weren't going to give us that room over the phone in the AM but stuck us with that room anyway...the bathroom was semi-moldy and not done yet. After the first night, we asked and finally got a completed remodeled room which was very nice and comfortable. (2nd floor middle corner room). They have free parking, but only a limited number of spaces so you had to stake your claim early. Breakfast was nothing special, cold cereal, OJ, coffee, cocoa, danishes. At least it was free. I thought the area was safe since it was off the Lombard main drag, but apparently, the hotel was held up the second night we were there. Otherwise, it was very quiet, and comfortable (if you get the right room), but the staff needs to communicate better. A major plus...free wireless internet!

<Content>Great location. Great price. Yes, it's a standard hotel. Yes, the rooms are small. But, at $79 with a RoomSaver coupon, it's a bargain. The huge kingsize bed was a luxury. The staff was very helpful. It's 300' from the East entrance to the Persido, so it's a short drive to Fisherman's Wharf or Golden Gate Park. Quiet Neighborhood. Limited parking, but if you're only going to be there one night, leave your car there and walk around the corner to the Baker Streret Bistro. The property is being constantly improved.

<Content>Good Value Lodging for San Francisco This Travelodge is located at the entrance to the Presidio, which used to be an Army Post and is now part of the US Park Service. It is very near to the Golden Gate Bridge and is convenient to the attractions in and around the Presidio and the 'Marina' area of San Francisco. The hotel itself looks to be a renovated motel, but it's located in an area off the busy portion of Lombard St. so it was fairly quiet. I spent 3 nights there and slept well each night. I would recommend the rooms toward the back of the complex. The room itself was nothing exceptional but everything was comfortable, clean and functional. The beds were very comfortable with attractive bedding, a microwave and refrigerator were provided and the room (#301) was a corner unit with windows on 3 sides. The bathroom was very small, similar to european B  B bathrooms with no tub just a shower, but everything was clean and in working order.The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, the housekeeping staff did a good job. A very skimpy continental breakfast is offered at the front desk; juice, coffee and some breakfast rolls which you have to eat in your room or elsewhere. There is no breakfast room but there are many great places to have breakfast.The location offers many unique eateries nearby, and Chestnut St. has a wide selection of cafes, coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants with every kind of dining and grocery stores selling exceptional produce. There are many boutiques and shopping establishments as well. The area had only 2 franchise restaurants that I saw, an IHOP and a Johnny Rockets, everything else is a one of a kind.Parking is available but limited onsite and an overflow lot is around the corner. Street parking and public parking is expensive if you're not from a big city with similar rates. I paid about $100 a night for the room a double/double but found a $74 rate from the Roomsaver magazine. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Perfect place to stay This hotel was absolutely fabulous. The room was spotless, the king size bed was comfortable and the location was magnificent! It was in a very safe neighborhood and within walking distance of great restaurants and shopping, plus the bus stopped right down the street. Gary was a great help in securing our shuttle to the airport and helping us with places to eat. The hotel was very quiet as it was at the end of Lombard street. Great place to stay and the price was right.

<Content>Had a Great Time! Typical cramped motel room and overpriced ($109). But it was in reasonably good condition, the beds were comfortable, it was quiet at night (being two blocks from Highway 101), we had a fridge and microwave, and there was plenty of hot water. And the best part--the location! Chestnut, the main street of the Marina District, was just around the corner with plenty of cafes and shops and a real hometown atmosphere. Also, the Palace of the Fine Arts, and the waterfront were nearby, and you can take a public bus to Chinatown and Downtown.

<Content>Very Quiet and Convenient I needed a hotel near the Fort Mason Center, and I needed to get a good night's sleep for three nights. All the other hotels along Lombard St/101 are right on the highway and you can see from the reviews that people have had horrible experiences with noise. The Travelodge Presidio is farther down Lombard, after 101 curves away = quiet! It's right near all the beautiful green trees of the Presidio, and the shops and restaurants on Chestnut Street are a short walk away. My room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom could use some refurbishing, but again, everything was clean. I never heard a sound from the highway or other guests. The staff at the front was friendly and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone on a budget who wants something quiet!

<Content>Excellent Location - Great Front Desk Staff This hotel is in the perfect spot away from all the bustle of a big city. The bus stop is right around the corner by the historic Gates of the Presidio.The bus takes you straight into China Town, shopping at Union Square.Beautiful homes on the famous Pacific Heights is one block away with enough steps offering aerobic exercise for those so incline like myself.On the other side, the Palace of Fine Arts is 1.5 blocks away beckoning in all its serenity. Chrissy Fields is across the road from the Palace which is exercisers haven. You can a beautiful early mornign view of the Golden Gate bridge from here...San Francisco is utterly beautiful!Wish to revisit next year.

<Content>Terrible, noisy, dirty We stayed over 1 night on our way to the North Coast of California. We choose this hotel because of the reviews, the price and location to the 101. We were sadly disappointed. The hotel is undergoing renovations, which they did not tell us. There was trash everywhere and not just construction trash (carpet, etc..) there were dirty towels and sheets, lying in the passage way that looked as though they had been there for a while, there were fast food containers everywhere, just thrown on the ground and it looked like the trash had not been emptied in many weeks. There were cigarette butts overflowing the containers and stunk to high heaven (right outside our window by the way) and trashcans from the rooms, lying around the outside. They could have done so much better at making the place look at least presentable during the construction phase, but they truly didn't seem to care that smelly trash was everywhere. It is also a very noisy hotel and the sound carries down through the floors. We were kept awake half the night by other guests coming and going, slaming doors and yelling all night and by their TV at 4:00am. The showers had some mold in the corners and the bathroom floors looked scary. I kept my slippers on the entire time and would not walk on the bare floors. I have a thing about flimsy thin blankets and theirs were aweful. We had to bring in our down comfortable from the car to stay warm. Overall, if this hotel was a little more soundproof, and cleaner, it might not be bad for the price, but I will NEVER stay here again and cannot recommend it.

<Content>Cozy, Quiet + Clean Budget Hotel on the Presidio We booked a single bed room here as a walk-in with a Traveler Coupon for $77 for 1 night, and the place was fine. Very clean and quiet, and about a block or two from the park. Swank French Bistro on corner along with a deli, and a pub just around same corner. Our L-shaped room was smallish, but very comfortable for a 1 bedroom. There were 2 windows facing the beautiful lush backyard, and the breeze coming thru them was great. I do remember seeing others' bathroom windows facing the balconies, as the previous reviewer had - so ask for one with windows to the back. Bonus was the fridge and microwave. Though there were a few other similar hotels lining these blocks (we didn't check on prices there), the neighborhood felt fairly residential, and thru the back windows you see some great architecture of the houses people live in around here.

<Content>Excellent Hotel for Budget Travelers I'm giving this hotel a neutral rating but as a budget traveler my expectations were actually exceeded by my experience there. I was looking for a cheap place that wasn't in the noisy downtown area and that didn't have postage-stamp sized rooms - and I got it! If you're frugal and don't mind not having an elevator, a lobby, or fancy furniture I think you'll be very happy with this hotel.The downside: our room could have used better ventilation. There was no way to open the windows and get the air moving without sacrificing our privacy. The bathroom window desperately needed a curtain as it actually faced into the hallway/balcony. Since the bathroom had no fan(!) opening the window was the only way to keep the steam down while showering so I had to hang a t-shirt in front of the window. Kinda silly. The result was that the room was a bit muggy.Also, as I mentioned, there is no elevator in this kind of hotel so don't stay here if you have trouble carrying your luggage up a flight of stairs. This hotel also does not offer much of a view and as you might imagine -- the furniture, carpeting, etc is not exactly brand new. Also also, HBO is supposed to be included but we didn't seem to have it (But, so what? We didn鈥檛 go to San Francisco to watch TV.)The upside: the price was shockingly low. This made it possible for me and my co-traveler to spend our money on more important things (like eating out and shopping). I booked the flight and hotel together through Orbitz rather than through the hotel itself so I would recommend doing that to get the best deal. Our room had 2 queen beds, a microwave, a refrigerator, dresser, vanity, and table -- and plenty of room for 2 people to move around. The location is EXCELLENT. A quiet part of Lombard right next to the Presidio. Very close to 2 bus lines as well as a nice French restaurant and a convenience store.
