<Content>Just back...loved it! We found the staff to be unusually helpful, kind and charming! The rooms were big, and bathroom modern and welcoming! We found the location ideal for all kinds of exploring, not to mention, around the corner from the Anne Frank house.Ideal accommodations!

<Content>Loved the 't hotel We have just returned from 5 days at 't Hotel and it was fabulous. 't Hotel is a boutique hotel right on a canal in the heart of the city. It is very quiet, kid friendly, super clean. Very close to the Anne Frank house, great restaurants and shopping. There is not a bar or lounge. We reserved the canal view room and got room 7, top floor. When we got to the room (at 11pm) the crib was set up and there was a baby bath tub waiting for us. At breakfast, which is included, the super attentive owners had already set up a high chair for us. Breakfast consisted of meats, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, breads and granola. Very standard and delicious.The very knowledgeable staff was able to recommend restaurants, call cabs, and guide us in several ways with their fluent English.the ONLY drawback is there is one at all, is that the stairs are very narrow, steep and the ceilings in our room were sloped on one side which made it somewhat challenging for my 6'1 husband.

<Content>Great experience, perfect location t Hotel is in a great location, on a pretty canal in the Western Canal belt near the Jordaan. Its a fantastic location to explore Amsterdam without being in the midst of the touristy areas which tend to get a little cheesy. The staff is fantastic - they answered all our questions and even let us use their computer when we needed internet. We stayed in a room with a garden view (non-canal) and it was charming, bright and quiet. Note, the hotel has quite a few steep stairs to get to the rooms so those with trouble on stairs be wary. Overall, we were extremely happy and had a great experience.

<Content>Great location, nice people We just got back from a 4-night stay in Room 4 on the top floor, and encountered a grand total of one mosquito in our room. No problems with that at all.The rooms could use some spiffing up, but ours was quite comfortable and certainly not ugly or tacky in any way. The location can't be beat, and the people running it were as nice and helpful as could be. Not a luxury property, but a good value.

<Content>Pleasant stay but bitten alive by Mozzies in OCTOBER!! Just got back from this quaint little hotel. It is situated on a lovely little canal with gorgeous canal houses just 10 mins walk from Anne Frank house, which when you see the queues, proves to be very useful. You can get up early and get there for 9am when it opens. 'T Hotel is fairly well located for most places really as you can hop on a tram or canal bus or even walk.I was slightly disappointed in the hotel -I thought it would be more elegant. It was more a shop with rooms!!! The reception is the shop counter and there is no real hotel identity. Don't get me wrong the people were lovely and there is a really nice breakfast room which you get to by going just out of the hotel and down the stairs into the basement. Good breakfast and they even provided a packed breakfast for us on the early morning start to the airport.The rooms are adequate and clean but getting on the tired side -few stains on carpet, rusty tiles, chipped paintwork , dusty stairwell etc but still have a homely feel and done out in neutral tones. Our party had 2 rooms at the back overlooking the garden. The beds were VERY comfy and we would have had a good sleep..........BUT the MOSQUITOS were horrendous and it was the end of October so not just a summer problem. I just didn't sleep. They LOVE me and I have come home with about 5 bites on my face which have all swollen up and various on my body. I know that is not the management's fault and they do provide one of those electrical zapper thingys which does the job but that is what you pay for staying so near the canals I think.I would recommend this hotel for a few days but not a longer stay but take lots of Deet!!There are quite a few brown cafe's around which do good food in the evening very Dutch wholesome stuff and have great atmosphere. There is one just along from 't Hotel but the restaurant with the Michelin star mentioned on the hotel website is very expensive as you would imagine and looked a bit stiff.Don't miss The Night watch by Rembrandt at the Rijksmuseum or the Anne Frank house which is so moving. The Van Gogh museum is also interesting.

<Content>Loved the room  Our room was the large room on the 1st floor overlooking the canal. The beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom was nice. We had three large windows across the length of the room, but only one of them would open which could be a problem in warmer weather. There can be noise from the pedestrians and bicyclists on the street below, but it was never a problem.The breakfast room was very nice and certainly adequate. Our last morning we had to leave very early to catch a train, and the afternoon before, the staff left a wonderful bag of food and drink for us to take on our journey.We really enjoyed our stay here, and would certainly stay again. The staff was very nice and helpful.The stairs are very steep, but the staff helped with our bags.We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved the hotel (but not the mosquitoes!) Booked this hotel because of the location, in the Western Canal Ring which has beautiful quiet canals, a great range of cafes and restaurants, and quirky little shops but is also walking distance to all main attractions. Our room was huge, first floor, overlooking the canal, with excellent bathroom and very comfy beds. The breakfast, in a colourful room the basement, was excellent, kept us going most of the day! The young staff all speak excellent English and were very friendly, happy to look after our luggage on our last day when we had an evening flight, and didn't mind when we kept going back during the day to add bits of shopping to the luggage! The only problem was mosquitoes! - when we arrived we made the mistake of opening all the windows as it was lovely weather, and then that night we realised the room was full of mosquitoes! One window had a mosquito net over it, which should have given us a clue! - and reading our guidebook later it does tell you to watch out for mosquitoes along the canals in July and August!

<Content>Mosquito coast? My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. It's in a great location in the Jordaan area. It's on a quiet canal and near the tram stops. The room itself (#7) was large and served our needs well, although the carpets in the hall and room were shabby and stained. The bathroom was modern and clean. Breakfast was good. Our main problem with this hotel was the mosquitoes...yes...mosquitoes. At check out time, we were both covered in bites from head to toe. If you are visiting in the summer, beware. Our room housed a swarm of hungry mosquitoes. There is no air conditioning, although the fan in our room made it bearable as the weather was not too hot when we were there. If you go in summer, maybe a room on a lower floor away from the canal would be better. (also, there is no elevator and very narrow steep stairs.) For Amsterdam, this hotel is a good value, but for us...next time, we'd rather pay more for a mosquito free room.

<Content>Fabulous hotel I can thoroughly recommend 't Hotel, who went beyond the call of duty following a booking error. I'd booked into this hotel 6 months in advance, as I was due to stay for Queen's Day in Amsterdam when rooms always get booked up very early. About 2 weeks before I was due to arrive, they contacted me to say that they were horrified to have found my booking, as it was taken by the previous owner and had only recently surfaced. As the hotel was already fully booked for that weekend, they offered me an alternative room normally reserved for their friends to stay in, at a much lower price. When I arrived - and throughout the stay - the staff were all incredibly apologetic, helpful, and friendly. They even bought me a huge bunch of roses, and allowed me to use the room all day after checking out, at no extra cost, as my flight was later in the day. I could not have felt more welcome, and it is a gorgeous small canalhouse hotel, in one of the most beautiful locations in Amsterdam. I will definitely be going back.

<Content>Best Asset is Location The 't Hotel is perfectly located a block and a half from the Anne Frank House in a quiet section of Amsterdam. It is currently being managed by the same staff that manages the Slovenian Tourist Office, which shares the hotel reception space. Although everyone is extremely kind and accommodating, there are obvious flaws in this arrangement and the hotel gives the impression of being almost more like a rooming house than what is billed as a three star hotel. Small hotels are our preference and we seek them out but this one frankly disappointed us. The quaint canal house atmosphere includes a VERY steep climb up either 1, 2 or 3 floors depending on your room and is absolutely not suitable for folks who are unable to manage stairs with agility. The staff does handle the luggage, which is helpful. The rooms are average, at best, and starting to show signs of wear. The price is certainly right at this time of year but their summer rates may be too high for the quality of the experience.

<Content>Cramped Airless Room Found this hotel in the Wall Paper Guide (which they stock at the front desk). Website also has some nice pictures. We arrived tired from an overnight flight. Unfortunately, the guide and website didn't mention the small size of the room, the way they pack furniture in, the airless/recessed window (w/ a view of a brick wall), stains on the carpet, blood stain on one bed sheet, mold in the bathroom or poor set up. From my experience, I am assuming that they pay to get into the Wall Paper guide, since this place has nothing to do with that sensibility.Pluses were a very nice breakfast, helpful staff, and location. The hotel was an unmitigated disappointment. I assume other rooms in the hotel are better. Be sure to see your room before you check-in. But maybe you are better elsewhere. I know that I am.

<Content>A very good place to stay! I stayed in the t'hotel many times for various business trips to Amsterdam. If you hate the standard business hotels and do not require a fitness club, sauna etc. this is the right place to be.The location is superb for drinks after work or a nice dinner.Even parking is no big issue, I always managed to find something easily. Tried many places in Amsterdam, this is clearly one of my favourites.

<Content>A Wonderful Hotel!!! We just got back from a great week in Amsterdam. The hotel was trully beyond our expectations. My girlfriend had a birthday and they arranged a great bouquet of tulips, baloons and decorated the room in a real romantic way. We stayed in room #1 which had a terrific view of the canal. The room is full of light, very clean and has a great bath and shower. The breakfast was quite ordinary but very satisfactory with romantic background music and the staff was very very sweet.The most important thing is location, location, location. And the location of this lovely hotel is superb!! A very centre location, close to everyting, Jordaan, the Dam square, red-lights and the south. The pubs and restaurants near the hotel are really good, ask the staff for a recommendation. Next time in Amsterdam this is where we will be staying for sure!

<Content>Great location, lovely hotel and delightful staff Located in a lovely part of Amsterdam, on a quiet and beautiful canal. We had probably the worst room in the hotel, but it was still very comfortable and had everything we wanted. There are lots of restaurants nearby. Staff were delightful. Only thing that let it down was the preparation of the room which could be improved greatly..... hair in the bath (I hate that!), beds not made properly.. but this was minor. Nice breakfast too, in a very pleasant basement breakfast room. I would recommend it.

<Content>an amazing experience We arrived on January 3,2007 not really knowing what to expect. We came upon the hotel through a book put out by wallpaper magazine.The staff was friendly and accomodating upon arrival.The first two nights of our stay we were on the second floor with a room overlooking the canal.We both agreed that the bed was not only the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on in a hotel but the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in period.it was enormous. The last night of our visit we had to move rooms because of a prior reservation but they were able to give us another with a canal view this time on the top floor. Aside from having to climb several flights of narrow stairs(which are apparently all too common throughout holland)we loved the room.it had to twin beds which was a bit of a bummer but certainly not a damper considering the uniqueness of the room with windows along one whole side of the room and a nicer bathroom. We had early morning departure and they made sure to send us off with an early morning snack,which we greatly appreciated.They were great and I would recommend this quaint bb to everyone,as long as you don't mind staying somewhere without a lift!

<Content>Gorgeous authentic Amsterdam hotel My husband and I just spent a perfect weekend staying at this gorgeous hideaway on the edge of the Jordaan. From the outside it looks like a boutique, facing on to a little canal...on entering it does not feel like a hotel, but an old dutch canal house with a modern twist.The staff were really welcoming, and the room spacious, airy and clean...with supremely comfy beds.The area is full of lovely traditional wooden bars, independent shops, and feels really calm but very cool.Would definately recommend if you want to experience a quirky and original small 'boutique' hotel in the nicest area of the city...if you are looking for identikit furnishings and chain hotel amenities then stay away (and leave room for us!)

<Content>Perfect location, lovely hotel Great location: 3 minutes walk from Dam square on a lovely quiet canal.Lovely Building: Authentic old canal house tastefully decorated, nothing garishStaff: very pleasent and helpfulThis hotel is a super find close to everything and you will really feel as though you are staying in Amsterdam, not in another non descript standard hotel room which could be in any city in the world.Anne Frank's house is around the corner and the Jordaan is only a minute away also.An observation about some of the reviews by American visitors that seem to think that behind the door of a canal house should be found a state of the art Mariott type mind numbing experience: the hotel is 100 years older than your country!! Stayed in room 8 with 3 young children, they loved staying in a real canal house, especially climbing the steep stairs and the mezzanine that was like a private room for them. Be aware that the mezzanine is quite open and may not suit sleepwalking children! Enjoy the experience!Highly recommended

<Content>disappointed by the t'hotel We have just come back from a 3 night stay at the t'hotel, slightly disappointed by the run down feeling of the place. the stylish website had let us to expect a much higher standard of accommodation. We had a room facing the back of the hotel, overlooking a shabby courtyard immediately beneath our window. the room, although spacious, was characterless, fairly dark and had an undefinite smell which could have been damp. the minute bathroom was a joke for a hotel that is described in lonely planet as a boutique hotel. the breakfast was good, delicious coffee and muesli, but was spoilt by the noisy chatting and mobile phone conversation of the staff sitting in the adjacent kitchen area. not impressive. We definitely do not recommend this hotel in this present state. Shame because it has a great location.

<Content>Good location One of the best located small hotels in A'dam. Quiet. I stayed in a non-canal facing room, despite wanting a canal room. I was told that for three night bookings it isnt possible to have a canal facing room, which seems strange.Good sized room was a little plain, but enjoyed some limited Deco character. Bathroom small and only a wood panel separating from adjoining room - so you get to hear all their noise and vice versa!.Breakfasts good in pleasant basement room. I found the people to be friendly and helpful.All in all, Id recommend for the location alone. But dont expect the sort of 'character' internally that the Time Out guide seems to enthuse about.

<Content>A splendid hotel in a charming neighbourhood We thoroughly enjoyed our recent 4-night stay at 'T Hotel in Amsterdam, with my in-laws (in their 70s) and our 2 yr-old daughter. The rooms are large, clean, and bright; the beds are good and firm, with soft thick sheets and cozy duvets; the bathrooms are a fine size, and the windows offer gorgeous views to the peaceful canal below (ask for a garden view if you'd prefer not to listen to the nearby 17th-century churchbells). This is the ideal neighbourhood from which to explore Amsterdam's galleries, shops, cafes, and quiet avenues on foot or by canal-boat; it is just around the corner from Anne Frank House, in the West-Central Canal district (a short walk from the Westmarkt tram stop, thus 5 mins. from Centraal Station, which is 15 mins. from the airport). Excellent quiet sidewalk cafes very close by. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is fantastic--nearly anything you want, as much as you like, anytime after 8. They even prepared Scottish porridge for our daughter--just the way she likes it. Yes, the stairs are rather steep--but this is the case in any canal-house, and shouldn't pose a problem for anyone who's reasonably fit. They will happily manage suitcases for guests, and keep a pram on the ground floor. The large windows in the rooms do open--which is dangerous for small kids, but it's easy to keep them closed. All the modern conveniences (including email) are offered in this lovely  unique small hotel. We will definitely stay there again. Enjoy!

<Content>Great location but lacking luxury I recently spent 3 nights at t'Hotel while on a business trip. It is on a very quiet, pretty canal and only a short walk from the centre of Amsterdam. I agree with writers of previous reviews that while there is nothing too much wrong with the place, it doesn't live up to the rather overblown billing its proprieters use to describe and market it. It is not a luxury hotel, the rooms are functional and the beds are comfortable. One could go on about the rather souless interior decor and the thrown-together feel of the furnishings and fittings but perhaps that misses the point - the place does possess a certain simple charm, just don't expect to feel spoilt there. A good enough base from which to explore the city, but a poor choice as a romantic bolthole.

<Content>Best hotel in Amsterdam This hotel is a personal favourite of mine. An Amsterdam townhouse on a quiet side canal, yet within walking distance of just about anything you want to see (and convenient for Anne Frank's house in particular). The rooms are HUGE, well appointed, with clean bathrooms, fridge, TV, buffet breakfast and friendly staff. It's the only place I would stay in Amsterdam. Try for a room on the canal side.

True,it is not really a luxury hotel but it is charming and the staff are friendly and helpful. We had a beautiful bunch of flowers in our room to greet us and little extras, like the bottle opener, were gratefully received. Our room (6) whilst not overlooking the canal, was spotless and blissfully quiet. We had lots of room and the beds were comfy! The wi-fi was a bit temperamental but this didn't really detract from our visit.The location is excellent. We will certainly be back.

<Content>Lovely hotel, but not the 'luxury' described T'hotel, as others reviewers have noted, is a quaint hotel in a scenic and central location. The main drawback, I feel, is its advertising. The hotel's website and literature consistently describes its rooms as luxurious. While t'hotel is undoubtedly an attractive and authentically 'Dutch' canalside townhouse, is is certainly not luxurious. The walls and doors are thin, the fixtures and fittings are merely satisfactory and the paintwork and the interior generally, in places, requires repair. The service, also, while completely satisfactory, was certainly not that of a luxury hotel. (For example, I often had to wait around for the receptionists and on arrival I wasn't shown to my room and I carried my own bags). I do, however, recommend the hotel. It is charming and characterful. The staff is friendly, my room was spotlessly clean and very spacious. I would, however, suggest that single travellers (like myself) might get a much better deal elsewhere, as the hotel doesn't offer a discount for signle occupancy. Do go, just don't expect the advertised 'luxury'.

The area is wonderful: restaurants, bars, galleries and shopping are in the immediate area, and it is safe at all hours. It is a small hotel, loaded with charm. Breakfast is included. It is a short walk to the Jordaan, the most picturesque part of the city. We have found our spot in Amsterdam! The staff is helpful and thoughtful. If you want to experience the magic of the old Amsterdam, the 't Hotel is the place to stay.

<Content>Bliss! We stayed at the 't hotel in January of '06 right after new year and had the hotel to ourselves for the first night of our three night stay. The manager very kindly gave us a tour of rooms to see which one we preferred and we picked Room 7 at the top overlooking the canal. It is one of the most charming hotel rooms in which I have stayed - up in the eaves with exposed beams and a wall of windows looking across the canal to the beautiful buildings of the Jordaan neighbourhood. It was lovely lying in bed watching the half moon through the top window and listening to the nearby church strike the quarter hour. The manager also helpfully recommended a couple of good vegetarian restaurants close by, and at breakfast another member of staff, Camilla, drew us a map to Beginhof, which we thouroughly enjoyed. Yes, the bed is two twin beds pushed together. Yes, the stairs are steep and narrow. For us, these are things that add, rather than detract from the experience of being in a different country. Staying at the 't hotel made us fall in love with Amsterdam.
