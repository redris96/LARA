<Content>Excellent Hotel in a Great Position My partner and I stayed at this hotel in July 2008. It's position is excellent and well placed for visiting the sights like Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, Uffizi etc, which are only 10-15 minutes walk.We stayed in a standard Classic room and for the price we paid it was much better than we imagined it would be and had all the facilities that you would expect of a higher classified room.My partner is vegetarian and the menu choice for vegetarians was excellent. The food was tasty and waiting staff very efficient and even though it was very busy, waiting time for our meals was kept to a minimum.We have booked again for September 2009 and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for an excellent hotel in the best location for exploring Florence and its environs.

<Content>Impressed We did not book this hotel, but were sent here as our original hotel was under construction. We were given a room on the 6th floor. Were were completely suprised when we opened the window to be able to see the Duomo and Baptistry from our room. It was a very nice. The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk from the train station. It is in an area with multiple restaurants, some full tourist, and some with lower prices on a set menu. It was easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go from the hotel. The hotel had multiple elevators, which was nice. The lobby was large, nice, and had 2 internet terminals. It was about 5 euro for 15 min, which we found pricy. There was an internet place nearby though. It was also near a bread and liquore shop, which we took advantage of. The room was very nicely, modern decorated, above average in size (for Europe), with an large bathroom, including tub. Mutilple TV stations on a flat screen. The breakfast was quite large, buffet style. It was the best hotel breakfast we had between the 3 hotels we stayed at on this trip. The only negative thing was that the front desk staff was somewhat slow and we could not just leave, but had to be fully checked out by them.

<Content>Wonderful hotel in a great location The Grand Hotel Adriatico was an excellent hotel in a great location. Altough in a little backstreet it was about a 10 minute walk to the centre of Florence either through the streets or along the river - which was lovely. Our room was fantastic with a huge bathrooom. The breakfast was really good - loads of choices to suit all needs and tastes. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel had a really grand feel to it.Florence is a wonderfully cultural city and there was so much to see and do. Although we queued for 2+ hours to see David it was well worth it (we did however found out after that we could have bought advance tickets throuh our hotel and avoided the queues!). Palazzo Pitt was absolutely stunning. I spent my birthday there and it was just wonderful. We would thoroughly recommend the hotel and would certainly use it again.

<Content>Lovely hotel The Grand Hotel Adriatico is a very nice hotel! We were Belgian guests, staying there in a three persons room from 13th until 15th August. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very nice and clean! The rooms were also very quiet. We never heard one of the other guests. Breakfast was excellent and extensive. The location of the hotel is very good (in the center of Florence nearby the train station). We can definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel After a disappointing stay in a supposed 4 star hotel in Pisa, this hotel lived up to the 4 star. We were early enough to secure a free car park space which was a bonus (they work on first come, first served basis but there are around 15 spaces in secure area). The staff were helpful  friendly and happily booked us into the museums we wanted to visit. Room was small but clean, bright and modern. Breakfast had a good selection. It's about a 10 - 15 min walk into centre but there are shops / restaurants all along. We would stay here again and have also recommended to friends visitng Florence.

<Content>Loved Adriatico! 3 days here before moving onto Siena. Really lovely hotel and staff. Had reasonably equipped buffet breakfast in shaded garden. Room clean and our son had small room adjacent to ours. Hotel restaurant expensive but lunch was lovely. Travelled with Citalia who transfered us to Hotel by taxi from Pisa Airport.Florence is nice but very expensive and we booked in advance tours of Uffizi and Acedamia which was good as long queues in strong sun and extreme heat. Definately climb 463 steps to Duomo as Dome paintings need to be seen near as are exceptional. Ponte Vechio bridge over rated but if you like gold shops then go for it!Would recommend hotel!

<Content>Really Liked the Grand Hotel Adriatico We stayed at this hotel for two nights. This hotel is very convenient to the railroad station and not far from the main attractions. The building itself is not historical or pretty. However, it has a really nice interior and the rooms look as if they were very recently renovated. The decor is the room is Tuscan style and bathrooms are very nice, modern flat screen tv as well. Air conditioning is great and this came in very handy when we experienced super hot weather. The Reception was very nice and the breakfast was very good. The Hotel restaurant ended being great. We were very impressed with the quality of the food and it ended up being one of favorite meals on our trip. I would definitely recommend this hotel if traveling by rail and you want modern, clean rooms and great air conditioning on a hot day!

<Content>Good Hotel This is a very convenient hotel. I stayed with my family for 2 nights (2 Adults + 1 kid). It is very close to main station about 5 minutes walk and also about 10 to 15 minutes walk to all the attractions in Florence. You can take a train to Pisa which runs every 20 minutes from main station. It takes about 1 hour to reach Pisa. Pisa is half a day visit. Hotel is clean, rooms are clean and breakfast is above average. There are couple of convenience stores about 100 feet from hotel to buy groceries etc. Staff is very cooperative and can speak better english. Internet is expensive. However there is any internet cafe is next to the hotel which is less expensive. I strongly recommed this hotel to the tourists visiting with families.

<Content>Great hotel, good location Stay in hotel Adriatico was part of Gate1 tour that happened in Apr 2008. It was a very wise choice on their part - 20 mintes of leisure walk walk to all main sights. A lot of Italians were staying in a hotel as well.If you are not comforable in immigrant block, you might feel unasfe walking at night. But really there is no problem - its a city and you have to live its life. For italians it wasn't a problem - there are a lot of great restaurants, wine bars near the hotel filled by locals. We had one of the best meals just around the corner from our hotel (recommended by british guidebook Lets go Italy)Train and bus station is 7 min walk from a hotel - very convinient for trips outside of Florence.Due to the brand you'll find some amenities Americans are used to, it has more modern classic than traditional tuscan design. Hotel is eco friendly with light saving option. Breakfast was european style with cold meat cuts, bread, fresh fruit, some cereal, omlet (very runny) and deserts. Rooms are big enough with flat screen TV, hard wood floor, cloth press. Typical for Europe - absence of queen size beds - its two twins pooled together. Bathrooms have tab, towel warming rack. Modern windows keep the street noise down.WIfi connection was available at the lobby - It seems expensive, nezt door to the hotel there is a very simple internet cafe where 1 hr online cost you 2 euro. But I don't think you have much time to spend on a computer - unless you have your museum resrvations online. Highly recommend to make a reservation for Uffizi gallery before you leave for Italy. Otherwise its very hard to get tickets - hotel will be able to make arrangements for triple of the regular price. Its a hotel business - so its your choice how you want to spend your money. Average meal was around 22 euro per person including Salad or Soup or Pasta as a first course and entree as a main course including wine and coffee.There is a very good outdoor market by Palazzo Vechio be careful what are you buying - some scarfs are made in Asia or India (but have italian labels on them) - look around.

<Content>Close to Turist Attractions The hotel is located close to lots of attractions. Around the hotel you find that inmigrants from different parts of the world (Colombia, Egipt, etc) gather in different outside cafes. The elevators were small (european standard) the breakfast (included in price) was better than expected. The rooms were acceptable and clean. Reception personnel were helpful always. Internet conection worked properly. No problem getting a cab in 5 minutes (reception personnel got it without problems).

<Content>Reasonable but nothing special. My wife and I stayed at the Adriatico for five nights in early April. We flew into Pisa airport and travelled by bus from the airport to Florence. The bus drop off, by Florence rail station, was a fairly easy walk of about a six or seven minutes from the hotel. Not particularly impressed at first. The road was pleasantly busy with lots of bustle and noise, cafes, small shops, car hire places, groups at tables on the pavement, etc......... and then someone tried unsuccessfully to pick my pocket as we towed our cases along the pavement outside the hotel's main entrance - which happened to be closed off because of building work. However, nothing too disastrous, could happen anywhere we thought as we wandered round to the back entrance. Reception staff in particular and others were charming both on arrival and throughout the week. The breakfasts were good with plenty of variety, nice lounge area, bar (but watch the prices of drinks), bedroom and bathroom very clean and modern, comfortable beds, internet access available, flat screen TV, tea and coffee maker in room (we had to ask though) and a reasonable view across the roof tops towards San Lorenzo, Fiesolo and the hills.There were several very acceptable places to eat nearby (Il Profeta was good and convenient), the Arno was about two minutes walk and the main sites were ten to fifteen minutes easy walk away.For a superior double the room was bit small... even for Italy. We looked at another superior double on the next floor but it was about the same. The one big problem was that the air conditioning couldn't be adjusted as the hotel told us it was all centrally controlled. So we had to put up with a very warm room or open the window at night to let some air in - but that meant that the noise from the bars and traffic was a bit too much .... we tended to have the heat rather than the noise.Apart from the air conditioning problem which presumably was just a temporary problem for the time we were there(?), the Adriatico was a reasonable place to stay but it didn't have anything particularly special about it. Probably a bit cheaper (booked through last minute.com) than some of the equivalent more centrally located four star hotels. However, for us, it seemed a bit too much part of a chain for conferences/business groups in a not too wonderful situation. The restaurant was closed for most of the week we were there and the builders at the front were still there when we left. Again ....nothing disastrous but if I was going back to Florence I would probably try somewhere else.

<Content>Definitely recommended Pleased to see some good reviews have come up since I last looked. Have recently returned from a week at the Adriatico and found it very good. Staff helpful and mostly friendly (it's amazing how much good will you get from trying the most basic Italian - even buon giorno is a start - though everyone we encountered had at least some English). Room comfortable. Breakfast good. Don't expect a lot of local colour in the hotel itself - but the rest of Florence is full of it. Location near-perfect - did everything on foot and didn't even need a taxi from the station. Area perfectly OK, though as Londoners we are used to what cities are like, so are not going to be put off by the rather dimly-lit streets or the odd bar with customers spilling on to the pavement.Hotel restaurant welcoming and pretty good, if offering a rather limited menu. Can recommend two nearby trattorie - Cento Poveri in Via Palazzuolo and Armando in Borgognissanti. Neither particularly cheap (particularly Armando which specialises in Tuscan dishes) but not ruinous and both friendly and welcoming.

<Content>Perfect base for first visit to Florence I have just returned from four nights at the Adriatico. Contrary to some reviews here, the location couldn鈥檛 be much better: it is a short walk from the train station and a quiet and convenient base from which to explore the wonder that is Florence. Five minutes walk away is the church of Santa Maria Novella; another five minutes walk to the Baptistery; ten minutes from there to Santa Croce. In other words: you arrive at what Ruskin considered some of the central expressions of European Christianity within very easy walking. The bus station is also close, great for a day out in Sienna.The hotel is spotlessly clean (presumably refurbished since some earlier reviews), towels and sheets of high quality. The reception is efficient (if not particularly friendly); the breakfast staff are helpful and obliging. Breakfast itself includes an impressively wide choice. I had a twin room: not huge, but it had everything necessary, including comfortable beds and double glazing. I was actually glad to be looking into the back of the hotel: it made for nights untroubled by potential traffic (though the hotel is already in a quieter location). [Tea/coffee-making facilities not automatically included鈥攂ut the information pack makes clear that they can be requested and supplied free of charge.]True, the immediate surroundings of the hotel are a little unsalubrious. But if you want a sanitised and quaint experience, don鈥檛 go to Florence: it is one of its delights that Florence is firmly rooted in the earth (the Duomo is actually rather dirty) and yet you are also in the presence of endless sublimity. You arrive at the hotel down a scruffy side street, which nonetheless contains some decent quality shops.Didn鈥檛 try the restaurant. There are two very decent places to eat just outside the hotel鈥攂oth quite basic in d茅cor, but friendly, with good food (even for me, a vegetarian + more so for my non-vegetarian father) and (encouragingly) frequented by as many native Italians as visitors.My only quibble would be the cost of the accommodation. The best rate via Best Western鈥檚 website is steep. In the end, I booked through a lastminute website: the room for two was 拢100 per night that way, including breakfast. I wouldn鈥檛 pay more than that.I would have no hesitation in staying at the Adriatico again.

<Content>Great place to stay when seeing Florence Located a short walk from the FSM train station, this is an excellent place if one is in Florence for the museums and the area. The room was clean and comfortable, the breakfast just fine, a nice buffet. Most importantly, the hotel staff was very helpful with directions and information. My wife had emailed ahead to get tickets to the major museums and those were waiting for us upon arrival, so no waiting in lines at the Academia, etc. The is a moderately price hotel (we got a great 3-day deal with a 21 day cancellation provision) in a good area.

<Content>A great stay in Florence The Grand Hotel Adriatico is a well-located and comfortable place to stay while in Florence. Just a couple of blocks from the Arno, it is far enough away from the main attractions to be peaceful, but still close to everything you want to stay (especially convenient to the train station).The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and quiet, and our bathroom was well-appointed. The breakfast was very nice as well. We would definitely stay again!

<Content>Hotel safe theft hotel was very nice as accomodations go. The room safe was programmable. We put 775 USD and our passports in the safe. After 24 hours, the safe was dead. We reported it, and (apparently against hotel rules) returned from breakfast to find the head housekeeper with the safe open, replacing the batteries. The passports were there, but the money was missing. The manager was there immediately. He recommended we go to the Caribinieri, which I did. After 2 months, we have had no action from the hotel, the agents, or the insurance company for the hotel.

<Content>Good location A four night stay at the Grand Adriatico Hotel which we felt was a pleasant, easy comfortable place to stay with all the usual facilities of a four star city hotel. Bedroom was of a good size as was the bathroom in which were provided the usual range of toiletries. The bed was comfortable, air conditioning controls easy to operate, room safe likewise. Room was serviced regularly with fresh towels and sheets daily.Breakfast had a varied range of items and the breakfast staff were attentive,helpful and responsive to special requests.Reception staff helpful and pleasant.If you are lugging suitcases etc it takes about 6 minutes to walk to the hotel from the main railway station. Don't even bother taking a taxi as it will take about 20 min !At first we felt that the area around the hotel was a little seedy but after a day sightseeing around Florence we realised this was how much of Florence is. The hotel is in a good location for getting around. It's just a 10 min walk to the centre whilst the River Arno is a 2 min stroll away. If you don't feel like walking to the centre then one of the inner city electric bus routes is just two minutes away. Be warned the buses are small (8 seats in some cases) and you may have to stand.The main railway and bus stations are five mins or less away if you aren't carrying luggage. We made half-day day trips to both Pisa and Siena quite easily.Would we use this hotel again? Yes.

<Content>Reasonable Hotel in Florence, near Main Train Station Booked a two-night stay at the Adriatrico in mid-April 2007 through a travel agent. The hotel turned out to be fine, although some construction was taking place outside the main entrance. I think the rating of 3.5 is about right. Good points: within walking distance to the train station, Arno river  most major sites, no street noise/quiet room, very comfortable bed and clean modern room, reasonably helpful and pleasant staff. I may consider another hotel next time in a more central location, due to some dark streets surrounding the hotel. When we walked out for dinner, some streets near the hotel did not feel as safe  well-lit as other parts of town.

<Content>Comfortable hotel, good location I was pleasantly suprised by this hotel. It is in a good location - walking distance to many of the major Florence attractions, a few miles from both the airport and train station, with a friendly staff and a complimentary buffet breakfast (which was actually decent considering the fact that it was free). The room was somewhat plain but large compared to other European hotels I've stayed at with similar prices, and nicely equipped with a mini-fridge, safe, pants press, etc... The room itself appeared to have been recently renovated, and I had a great view of the city being on the top floor. As with the other hotels I stayed in while visiting Italy (both Westin hotels), the air conditioning was not functional this time of year, so the window (no screens) had to be left open quite often, letting in some noise from the street below, but definitely tolerable. Also, the beds were quite firm, which took some getting used to.Overall, I think this hotel was a great value for the price and I'd definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>Poor Service The hotel boasts a 4 star rating but this is highly overrated. The service of the staff ruined our stay and experience in Florence. They were rude, and as I read here on the site uncaring. We used the Westin front desk for advice and help and they were utterly gracious and we were not even guest there. Very disappointed in the this hotel. Do not let the name fool you, it is anything but Grand. Bed linnens were shoddy, rayon spread that you would see at a Motel Six. Awful place.

<Content>Hotel piacevolissimo! (very pleasant hotel!) My friend and me strayed at the Grand Hotel Adriatico for 2 nights and it was a great stay! I'm surprised to read some comments because the staff was very nice and helpfull with us. Our room was clean, well light and smelt of fresh whitened, it was very quite and extremely comfortable. A great surprise was the parquet, that I found more healthy than the usual carpet and warmer than some tile floors. The bed was one of the best I have ever slept on, new soft cotton sheets. Good idea the flat screen TV in the mirror, the audio can be heard in the bathroom too!!! The buffet breakfast included in the price, was good and offered a wide choice of sweet pastries, juices, yogourts, high quality jam and Twinings teas. The Barman Sergio was extremely friendly and also gave us the possibility to have our drink outside in the garden to enjoy the beautiful evening, also if it was already midnight.We didn't eat in the restaurant because too expensive, but directly in front of the hotel there is a good Pizzeria. The hotel is very well located 2 min. walk from the central railway station and only 10 min. from the most important monuments. We hope to go back to Florence and to find availabitly in this hotel, because it was a great stay!!!!

<Content>Great hotel 鈥?comfortable, clean and quiet. Good service. Well located. We were very happy with our stay at the Adriatico. Very comfortable bed with fresh, soft, cotton sheets, plush extra blankets in wardrobe. Also, the walls are thick, so the room was very quiet. We had one of their cheaper double rooms too when they were almost booked up, so if this was one of their lesser rooms I'm fairly impressed :-)I'm baffled by some of the other remarks on here about this hotel!!??The hotel has obiously been totally renovated recently 鈥?our room had that brand new feel and was decorated in a very sophisiticated creams, browns and burnt orange. Lovely wooden floors with 2 rush/leather trimmed mats, and thick full length window dressings. The room had very high ceilings, and a tall window by the dressing table. We had a flat screen tv (had CNN, Sky news and MTV as well as Italian channels) and remote control air-con (though I think it only goes down to 17掳c). Mini-bar had selection of drinks, but only 1 sweet and 1 savory snack, I guess more nibbles would have been nice! There is a trouser press in the room, and a combination safe-box in the closet. Floor length mirrors were much apprecciated, often not provided in hotels. Also plenty of space to lay out your personal items, and a very good luggage bench, a small table, two chairs and a dressing table. Lighting was very good, varied and task specific. Well designed medium-sized room overall.The bathroom was excellent, good water pressure, plenty of hot water, spotlessly clean. Also the bath towels were very large, thick and soft 鈥?a pink one for her and blue for him :-)I had a nice soak in the great deep tub after a long car journey, heaven!Housekeeping replenished everything daily and changed linen and towels leaving room fresh and clean.The staff were extremely nice and very helpful, drawing out directions for us on maps they provide and recomending restaurants, extra pillows provided immediately on request. Was wonderful to have the free parking right there at the hotel, we arrived just as a huge downpour started and its was only a few steps from our car to the lobby.Breakfast is included and was good, wide choice 鈥?bacon and scrambled eggs, cereals, cold meats, cheese, fruit, yougurts, croissants, fresh sweet pastries, toast, coffees, teas, hot chocolate, 3 kinds of juices.Restaurant on premises wasn't great, pasta over cooked and not a great choice. We tried it on the night we arrived, however, the desserts were excellent! There are other restaurants just meters away though.

<Content>Sweltering room in April and staff who do not care We stayed in Best Western Grand Hotel Adriatico while in Florence when other hotels were booked. It appears that the reason this hotel had rooms available is the combination of high price and poor service. We checked in late on a warm April day and noticed that the room was quite hot (85 degrees.) We opened the window and went out to eat. On our return the room had barely cooled. The Front Desk said the heat was for our room (even though the temperature in Florence that day had been nearly 80 degrees) and said they would turn off the heat. We awoke at 3:00 am due to the high temperature in the room (again 85 degrees.) No one answered at the Front Desk so I went to find someone who agreed to turn off the heat again. The next day I complained about the temperature and was basically ignored. This is unacceptable for a 4 star hotel. Overall the staff were unprofessional. In addition, the breakfast was poor and there was no enough food for the number of people in the hotel.

<Content>Bad, Bad, Bad Where can I start?Had a shoot in Florence and therefore had to organise accommodation for 8 people, 3 nights.Booked the Rivoli hotel online months ago. Everytime I called they to ask about confirmation,parking,etc they never mentioned any problems. However, when arriving in Florence, the gentleman told me there have been problems with their website and therefore we had to move to the Grand Hotel Adriatico. And there it all started...The basic mistake - gave us double rooms when we wanted twin ones. All fine, I thought - just need to go downstairs and ask them to change it. And so I did. Imagine my surprise when the gentleman refused to believe me but said: if you want another one, then take this one. Again, these rooms were double. Eventually, after 30 minutes and after me being sent with another member of staff to check I was telling the truth, we all got our rooms. Mine didnt have a safe or a working tv, my colleague's safe wasnt working. Again, the gentleman downstairs, condescently told me: impossible!! All rooms have safes. And most people just dont know how to use them!. So he came upstairs with me to show me where the safe was and how I should work it - very easy!!. To keep thing short,lets just say I even felt sorry for his humilliated look as none of the things he claimed proved true. And on top of everything, my colleague's room key opened all doors in the floor!!! How safe...Anyway, we changed rooms once again. And that should have been it. But remember the twin/double rooms situation? Next morning they were all made as double rooms instead of twins, as we had left them!! More complaints, more impossible comments and me, a rather calm person, losing it completely. VERY bad experience!!Horrible: Some staff were just plain rude and/or totally unprofessional. zero on customer service. Lack of organisation.Bad: for a 4 star hotel, breakfast was poor.Good: the car park. Very good,only one: the barman, Sergio. A great friendly guy.

<Content>Comfortable, clean Hotel We were originally booked to stay at another Best Western Hotel in Florence but due to room problems when we arrived (overbooking I suspect) we were relocated to the Grand Hotel Adriatico. The hotel is central but not on a busy street so was quite quiet. We found everywhere within walking distance, 2 minutes walk and you are on the banks of the Arno.The bedroom was clean, comfortable with decent shower and bath. Breakfast buffet was adequate, you had the option to purchase additional items for breakfast but in my opinion there was enough to set you up for the day.The staff we found to be very friendly and helpful and as a result I would not hesitate to stay here again if I was returning to Florence

<Content>Nice Hotel Spent 3 nights in this well located hotel.You can walk to all the main atractions within 10-15 minutes, including the Piaza Michaelangelio. Room was comfortable but some what basic. Probably not a 4 star but a good 3 star. Breakfast was adequate, main restaurant a bit pricy for what was presented. Over all a hotel that I would recommend and will certainly go back to it.

<Content>good but not special This place is fine - my girlfriend and i stayed here at the beginning of September whilst on holiday in Italy......we paid about 100 euros a night for the room  for that you get a clean, modern(ish), well-sized room with an excellent shower, an average buffet breakfast, in a handy location in Florence. The hotel is about 5 mins walk from the station  15 mins to the Duomo. The restaurant looked expensive - we didn't bother with it - but there's a nice place directly across the road. All in all, our experience was positive, although there isn't really anything to distinguish the place from a better 2 or 3 star. If you are returning to Florence  already know of somewhere cheaper than this that you like, then you probably wont find this worth the extra money.

<Content>Very pleasant and comfortable. This hotel served our purposes brilliantly - we needed a hotel with secure parking for an overnight stopover. Parking was indeed very secure which we were grateful for as I wouldn't have like to have parked on the street/public car park. Our room was well decorated and the bed was incredibly comfortable, one of the best we have slept on recently. Bathroom was clean, looked fairly new, comfortable; lovely powerful shower. Hotel was about a 10/15 minute walk from the City centre. The hotel bar was lovely, nice outdoor courtyard, polite friendly waiting staff, but prices were a bit steep. We ate at the pizzeria over the road and that was really good food at a very good price. Breakfast was typical Italian/Best Western style, they use Twinings teas so the British tea craving was adequately satisfied! Overall we found it clean and comfortable and if the price was right, and we would stay here agin.

<Content>Convenient location / good service / reasonable accomodations Our group stayed here during our trekk across Italy - husband, sisters, brother, aunt and parents. Everyone was pleased with the hotel. Sergio at the bar was always good to us. I wouldn't waste your time with the hotel's restaurants though. You can find similar in the city center for cheaper. No one had a problem with their rooms. Most were decorated as a Best Western in the USA would be except my sister and her boyfriend's - they had old charm furniture. The rooms were always clean and the bathrooms were good sized. Hotel was a short walk from the city centre. Actually, my mom didn't think it was that close so that maybe the youth in me. But really, I would say it was about five city blocks. And it is within walking distance from the train station.
