<Content>Service with a smile! The customer service at this hotel was excellent. From the hotel desk to the buffet staff, I couldn't have been treated nicer. Room was clean, modern and spacious, marble bathrooms with separate glass shower and garden tub, very comfortable bed and prompt room service. Located one block from Riverwalk shops and four blocks to Bourbon St, and Cafe du Monde, never used the car. I've stayed in Las Vegas/Atlantic City, Harrahs and found this to be the friendliest. Defintely would stay again when I get back to New Orleans!

<Content>Excellant Experience at Harrah's Our stay at Harrah's New Orleans was one of our best trips!! We arrived early and was able to pre-register. They held our bags and the clerk called us via cell phone when the room was ready. (about 1 hour later). We obtained our room keys, boarded the speedy elevators and our bags arrived at the room about 5-10 minutes later. The nice lady who brought up our bags, pointed out the features of the room, gave us a little New Orleans history  must sees, and even filled our ice bucket. The rooms were beautiful!! We were on the 14th floor with an excellant view of the river. The bed was one of the best sleeping beds you will find in a hotel. The bathroom was nice as well. Very clean, good hot water, shower water pressure was good (could have used a couple extra washclothes, but plenty of other towels). The service at Harrahs was top notch. We were always greeted, whether you were coming or going. Concierge was helpful, desk clerks always friendly. The casino was very nice and much larger than I expected. All the employees were very polite and entertaining. The cocktail waitresses were very prompt. Didn't hit it big on the games but I had fun trying. The rapid roulette was super. We only had two meals at Harrah's both were at Besch Steak. Mark our server at the bar did an exceptional job. Food was excellant!!!! It is well worth what you pay.The location is a few blocks away from Bourbon Street. But still conveniently located to walk. You can access the trolley cars right on Canal Street, which will take you most anywhere in the city you would want to go. I would get a map from the concierge desk that shows you what cars, go where. You can also purchase a day ticket or 3 day pass at the Marriott located on Canal, that will save you lots of money if you plan to get off at several stops (it is 1.25 (exact change) for each person each time you board) the pass is very helpful. This was our first trip to New Orleans and I reviewed this website before booking. I chose Harrah's for the gaming. I am sure there are other places that are less expensive than this, but you get what you pay for. I will definately be back.

<Content>Class Act @ Harrahs New Orleans My husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay at Harrahs New Orleans. We decided to go to Louisiana as a change of pace from Atlantic City. Everything at Harrahs was good from the accommodations,staff and restaurants.Yes I was comp'd for the stay, but as a slot player i felt the Hotel/Casino was first class.If you like gaming,this is the place to stay in New Orleans.

<Content>Best Harrah's in USA What a terrific job all of your employees are doing at Harrah's in New Orleans. We have stayed in many Harrah's including Atlantic City and Las Vegas. You are the best. Your staff could not have done anything more to make us feel welcome each time we entered the hotel. Our room was wonderful and the sweet dreams treat delicious. Our room was always extremely clean and well equipped. The casino staff were outstandingt. Drink service was readily available, which is not so true in other casinos. The buffet was very good and the wait time was great. We found all the people in New Orleans to be friendly, kind and considerate. Many the hurricane has helped these people to live a more kindly life. Whatever it is we were truly blessed to have enjoyed this vacation with you fine people.

<Content>Very nice My friend and I (who are frequent Vegas/AC visitors) spent 4 days/3 nights at Harrahs and just wanted to let others know that the hotel is very nice - the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are large with a huge tub and separate shower with great hot water and very good pressure. Beds are very comfortable. Linens nice and soft. Housekeeping kept the place clean and it always smelled fresh. Service at the hotel from the checkin desk to the doormen were extremely helpful and very friendly. As far as the casino, I'd say it was a good size and we didn' t find it too smokey - but then we were there during the week so therefore you don't get the weekend crowds. Large assortment of slot machines in all denominations - plenty of tables were open during the day and they opened more during the evening. We dined out - at Emerils in the CBD and K-Pauls in the FQ - both excellent. Had some very good dishes (only 1 we didn't care for too much out of 8) at Bambu (Asian food) in the Casino. The one thing we weren't used to was having breakfast cut off at 10:00 am - everywhere. But, you could order it thru room service until 11:00 am - and that worked for us. All in all, I was braced for the worst but was pleasantly surprised.

<Content>Horrible Harrah's With the many choices of hotels in New Olreans, do yourself a favor and stay anywhere but here. Just returned from a trip to NOLA visiting friends and family and stayed at the new Harrah's hotel because we heard good things. Will Never stay there again! Rip off from the begining. We had reservations at the Ritz Carlton and changed a week before because our friends said to try the new hotel since we gamble and because of the proximity to the casino. We were very wrong. The rooms were small and the same price as the Ritz without the service or ammenities. There were no robes, no water in the room, no minibar in the room (even though the website said there was) and no turndown service at night. The restaurant that we wanted to try in the hotel by Todd English was closed for good and there was no where to even get a drink in the lobby. In fact there was nothing in the lobby except the reception and elevators. If you wanted any food or drinks you had to walk through the neverending tunnel to the smokey casino. When we ordered room service for 2 bottles or small (tiny water) they charged us almost $8.00 and included a 20% service charge. In fact 20% service charge was on everything from room service even though after waiting nearly an hour for a bottle of wine- I would've only given them 15%. When complaining that there should be robes and water in the rooms for $500.00 night we were given 2 small bottles of water and 2 robes, however the maid toke the robes the next day and were never replaced- either was the water. After gambling for 4 days due to rain and losing a considerable amount of money we were told that we would be comped 1 dollar for each of us!!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah- I forgot that the valet parked my friends car and broke the stick shift because it was forced out of park instead of using the button release and they said they wouldnt pay for it and we should get a lawyer!!! They wouldnt even pay for the towing. They claimed it was broken before it came even though they drove it up to the garage?? Huh? If it was broken how did you drive it if it was undriveable after??? I have never experienced a worse time or experience for the money. I used to live in New Olreans and travel there 4 times a year and stay at many different hotels, the Hilton down the street is a much better choice for half the price, I bet just about anywhere is a better choice. DON'T STAY AT HARRAH'S!!!!

<Content>Best hotel room ever I received a free trip to New Orleans from harrah's and thought I bet this will not be the so great, trip included round trip tickets and hotel stay for three days and two nights. Best Hotel room in the world, was not regular size, nothing cheap in the room, luxury room. Suite is what they gave me, very impressed with the hotel and the good folks that work there. Was very happy with the exprience just wish it had been for a few more days cause there is a lot to see in New Orleans. Thanks from Donna out of St. Marys, Ga

<Content>First Class Service and Hotel My adult son and myself arrived at Harrah's New Orleans Casino (hotel), several hours before the posted check in time. We parked at the adjoining Harrah鈥檚 garage (501 Convention Center Blvd). It was about a 2-minute walk, vehicle to front desk. Hotel guest or not, parking in the Harrah's garage is free for each 24 hours with 1/2 hour of play at Harrah's Casino.We were greeted by a hostess every time we entered or left the hotel, wishing us a good day, etc. The front desk always had plenty of personnel ready to accommodate the needs of guests. Although we were early and our room was not ready, the front desk clerk took our cell phone # and offered to call us when the room was ready.We also had a great conversation with Bob, the concierge on duty then, telling him he looks like Woodrow Wilson. He assisted us with printing boarding passes and was knowledgeable of the area. Before we had time to leave the lobby, we were notified our room was available.Our room was on the 20th floor, classified as a luxury room. The elevators were fast, plentiful, and of course required a room key pass to access our floor. Our view was of the CBD/Warehouse District, and of the Mississippi River Bridge, very nice. The two beds were comfortable, and the room was spacious. The bathroom has a separate shower and bath, and a door separated the commode from the shower  sink area. Towels, etc were all new. The room was tastefully decorated. Although the TV was flat screen  HD, we never turned it on. Oddly enough, our voices would echo if we faced the entrance door of the room due to the length of the room foyer, and its tiled floor (the bedroom area is carpeted). There are lots of surveillance cameras throughout the hotel, and security is excellent.One can access Harrah's Casino either by a walk through tunnel from just outside the hotel, which goes under Poydras Street, or just walk across Poydras Street. The restaurant Richie is within the hotel itself. Harrah's Hotel is the center point for the growth along Fulton Street, where other dining and entertainment choices can be found under the Harrah's shadow  tied into their Rapid Rewards  comp system.Check out was even easier than check in. Throughout, Harrah's is a first class property.

<Content>Great stay at Harrah's We just stayed one night at Harrah's, booked through harrahs.com. Hotel was very impressive, not vanilla like Vegas' Harrah's property. It was like Rio or Paris LV properties, for comparison. They let us check in early, no problem. As other reviewers note, rooms are spacious with big foyer area, large bathroom with private toilet. Big jacuzzi tub and big shower. Nice Gilchrist  Soames toiletries like other high-end Harrah's properties. Hotel is very new so everything sleek, clean. Used fitness center, which had nice equipment and towels ready for you on the machines. Our room had a great view of the bend in the river looking toward the French Quarter. Great location, walked everywhere in French Quarter and close to CBD attractions also. Ate at the buffet's Sunday jazz champagne brunch, which I would definitely recommend.

<Content>Not Just for Gamblers. This is a very nice hotel. The staff were very friendly and approachable. The room was lovely and spacious. The bed was so comfortable, pillows great, linens noticeably of quality, and the comforter just the right weight. The bathroom is huge, and I loved the strength of the shower!The hotel is located one block from Canal Street. It was a great location, especially if you like to venture out of French Quarter. We walked to Cafe du Monde every morning by taking the riverwalk, probably about 1/2 mile. So we got our share of the French Quarter experience. We also walked the other way to go to WWII museum, formerly DDay Museum. Another easy pleasant walk. We caught the St Charles trolley 3 blocks away and went and saw the Garden district.I recommend this hotel. Great location and great rooms. .

<Content>There is segregation and really bad food at the buffet! First of all, there is segregation in the buffet, and probably the other restaurants also.... if you dont play with a card, but still spend lots of money in the casino, you have to stay in the unlit area that you must walk over 300 feet to get your own food! I asked to sit closer with my 78 year old mother and they told me NO. Now I know how the a black person felt back in the early 1900's, not being able to eat with everyone else! This place keeps the souths tradition alive and well! This practice must STOP!Then when you get to the food, its just like the other Harrah buffets, the same food, the same taste, the same crappy food!I paid $14+ per person and after one taste, waited for my raspberry tea (they were out of regular tea..... hot water and a few tea bags?) took a sip and left the place!!!Had a HOT hot dog on the corner of burbon st and it was great!

<Content>First rate A complimentary junket from the casino took me to this property. It is beautiful from the pillow top mattresses to the cozy robes. The marble bathroom is spectacular and the tub big enough for a family reunion. It is one of the few hotels where there seems to be more than enough employees to answer every need. The casino is across the street from the hotel and there is a person there to hand the guest an umbrella if needed.Room service was prompt and the food good in huge servings. I thought the prices a little high, but I used casino comp points so I really didn't care.

<Content>WOW This was our first stay at the Harrah's hotel in New Orleans. Our room had a great view of the bridge and city. The service at this property is outstanding - the employees here are friendly and helpful.The hotel is absolutely beautiful from the lobby to the bathrooms. Large deep soaking tub, separate shower - I loved that after a late night (early morning) return to the room. The location is great as it is only a walk across the street to the casino, a block from the Mississippi and a few blocks to Bourbon Street and the French Quarter. We loved our stay here and will stay here when we return.

<Content>Reservations are a conceptual thing here.... We planned a quick trip to New Orleans for a long weekend, getting in on a Wednesday night, planning to stay until Sunday. After confirming our reservation with Travelocity, uniTED, and Harrahs before departing (I've read reviews, thought it wise), we arrived at 11:30 expecting to check in our room, only to be told that our room wasn't available and that they would 'walk us down the street' and pay for a room on them. The hotel was adequate, but not what we wanted, we were embarrassed to be turned away after paying more than a fair price. Travelocity wasn't much help either, we got no credit for being put out like this, we had to wait until 3:00 the next day to check in, effectively gutting our planned day taking in the sights and scene that is New Orleans, and putting a real damper on our vacation. It was only 2 1/2 days more and we really had to hustle. The customer service center for Travelocity is based in India, they were ineffective and the response we had from them was frustrating and close to useless. I will never use an on-line travel agent, instead I will eat the few dollars more, book directly on my own, use reputable hotel chains and hope for the best.

The hotel is absolutely beautiful from the lobby to the bathrooms. The location is great as it is only a walk across the street to the casino, a block from the Mississippi and a few blocks to Bourbon Street and the French Quarter.Definitely try the bufffet at the casino - we are not buffet people, but this one is GREAT !!! Also Gordon Biersch restaurant next to the hotel is well worth a try.Most of all - please come and visit New Orleans - the city looks great and we felt safe everywhere we went.

As you enter and depart the hotel you'll be showered with Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Have a Great Evening. The rooms are beautifully decorated, comfortable, and cozy. The only negative would be that this hotel does not have a pool.

<Content>New and great Stayed at the new Harrah's hotel across Poydrus from the casino. scored a 23rd floor corner suite. ((Diamond member)) It doesn't get any better than this. Had a window on two sides so we could see the river and business district. The bathroom was at least 10x12. Soaker tub, walk in shower. Had two big screen TV's. Sitting room with a table, couch, bar etc.Had dinner at the French restaurant downatairs. Great food. there's an underground walkway to the casino in case it's raining. Had an overall great time, restaurants weren't crowded, Bourban Street was still hopping. Still see some buildings boarded up. Looks like N.O. is back in business.

<Content>Luxurious We stayed here on 06/05/07.I was totally shocked to see how plush this hotel was. We had been to Harrah's Casino years ago, but not spent the night. I just couldn't imagine how nice this would be. Framed prints in bedroom and bathroom. The one in the bathroom was numbered. Bathrobes and even an umbrella provided for guests. Furnished beautifully and view from window was lovely. Staff and front desk were very friendly and professional.The casino was huge, but not paying out too much. We ate lunch at Fuddruckers in casino. I've rarely been waited on by anyone who could have cared less than this employee. The restaurant in hotel looked very nice, but seemed a little pricey. If we go back to this area, I would definitely want to stay at this hotel.

<Content>Suite Sweet? We were comped at room at Harrah's . Had arranged for an early check in and confirmed the room type and early check in the day before. Upon arrival the room type and early check-in were not available...the front desk was totally inept. Advised us they would call us on our cell phones when the room was available and estimated a delay of about an hour...Three hours later when we called them the room was still not available...and also was not smoking as we had requested or a King bed...we eventually received the suite we had arranged...It was a very nice room...Mardi Gras Suite...nice color scheme with subtle useage of purple green and gold( mardi gras) colors in the decor. flat screen TV, dining room table, sitting area, nice useage of marble in the bathroom ,wet bar...it faced a courtyard that had a bit of noise from a jazz group but it wasn't excessive. An apology for our being inconvienced would have been nice but it was never offered. I'll definitely stay here again...but only if I don't have an pressing plans or engagements and can afford to not have access to lodging till the evening of day of arrival.

<Content>WHAT A NIGHTMARE... We stayed at this hotel basically out of necessity, since we were in town for a convention with many hotels booked. Nonetheless, the pictures and previous reviews seemed flattering, with prices that were parallel to many other hotels in the area (averaging $550/night during our stay).The lobby is beautiful and packed with more staff than imagineable, most of whom are very cordial. Above the lobby, however, is where the problems begin. We checked in to a dirty room, with robes, menus, remote control, pens, etc. missing and with an unidentified white powder covering all surfaces of the bedside stand and desk...Given that this is new orleans, my assumption was that it was powdered sugar from beignets, but you never know. It took three phone calls to correct this with marginal results.That was only the beginning. The rooms are quite possibly the loudest I have ever experienced. We heard every single personal act happening in our neighbors' bathroom as though they were standing in our room. Not pleasant, I can assure you. The staff shout at each other up and down the halls, screaming constantly. Room service trays litter the halls, with breakfast trays finallly cleared around 5 PM--the hall smelled of old bananas and syrup all day long. Requests to move these accomplished nothing.We had to cancel our suite at the Soniat House due to lack of accommodations for our last night. We should have stayed there and flown back early. This hotel is nothing like the Ritz, Borgata or any other higher level comparisons made in previous reviews.To top it off, we were double-charged for our stay with a grand total of almost $4000 for three nights. So far it has taken 5 calls with no resolution. Be extremely careful when dealing with this establishment and this staff. Clearly there are much better hotels with staff who understand the meaning of excellent service.

<Content>Loved the new hotel at Harrah's ! Stayed Feb. 11, 2007. Beautiful hotel - rooms are comparable to some of the nice ones in Vegas. Great comfortable beds, bathroom had 2 person tub and separate glass shower. Room service was excellent. Got the Angus Burger - was big enough for 2 and hard to take a normal bite because it was so thick; also ordered the 14 piece buffalo wings which were the entire wing and overflowed the plate.....excellent ! Check in was nice because although we were early, they took my cell number and called when the room was ready. Check out was a breeze. As nice as the rooms are...they should include a stocked bar - but the fridge was empty. Definitely will stay here next trip !

<Content>Great Hotel This is a great hotel! Best Beds, plenty of room, all the comforts you need. 24 Hour room service and best of all they were the nicest people all the way around. We were very satisfied and had a great time at the Hotel, Casino and French Quarter. The location is great for getting to all the French Quarter sights. We were there on the first weekend of Mardi Gras and with it as busy as it was no one at the Hotel or the Casino missed a beat on service. We have stayed at many other hotels in New Orleans and would return to this one first.

<Content>big fun and will return don't know why people are so critical. my wife and i had a nice time here. i tend to play 3 card, 4 card poker and low limit hold 'em. my wife plays the slots and pai gow poker. we stay away from blackjack so no comments will be made about that. i found the availability of seating to be ok to good. we played during the afternoon so we can't comment on availability during the evening. i did play a new table game based on texas hold em poker. it sucked and is a good place to lose your money. 4 card poker had some nice payouts for a $20/$10 bonus bet. the dealers at the casino were very nice and social. they seemed sympathetic when you lost and cheered you when you won big. i didn't mind tipping them. the hotel was clean and our non smoking room did not smell of smoke (we have had this experience in las vegas). the area surrounding the casino was pleasant and the people seem genuinely happy to have visitors. my wife and i did well so we are returning. it should be noted that our room and dinners for our return visit is a comp based on our previous visit. it was enough to make us plan another visit.

<Content>Beautiful People, Beautiful View, Just Plain Beautiful Spent three nights and three full days over Christmas on the 24th floor overlooking the Mississippi. The room was extremely well appointed, comfortable - the beds were to die for. The view was absolutely amazing...cruise ships, barges, paddleboats, the Riverwalk, the skyline. Every employee we encountered was pleasant from the doorman to the front desk to the maids to the folks at Besh to the folks at Bamboo to the ladies and gentlemen on the casino floor. This was my first time to New Orleans and you've won my wife's and my heart. We'll be back just at the city is well on it's way.

<Content>Beware!!!!! We have been going to Harrah's New Orleans every year for a few years now. Since they didn't have their own hotel we were always put up at the W or the Wyndham nearby. It has always been a wonderful experience. This year we were booked at the new Harrah's hotel. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful. The staff is absolutely horrible. The restaurant in the hotel is terrible. They might as well have served a plate of grease. It was not edible. For a $35 breakfast this is not acceptable. We have been Harrah's players for about 10 years. Due to a recent cancer battle I was unable to play as much and was demoted from Diamond to Platinum status. This really makes a difference for these people. The hotel didn't show my comp points as they were and refused to give us any credit on our room charges. They were incredibly rude and advised since they don't have a gaming license it wasn't their responsibility to accommodate us. It was a really strange situation. I finally asked to speak with the manager. A gentleman named Seabourne came over and was even ruder than the desk clerk. I finally called the Total Rewards desk over at the casino who advised that the hotel was completely incompetent and she fixed the problem in about 2 seconds. I sent a complaint in via the website when I returned home and was advised that the general manager Mr. Tran would call me the next day. About three weeks after that I received an email saying basically too bad I didn't enjoy my experience. This company has really gone down hill. It's too bad because it used to be such a wonderful, dependable hotel chain.

<Content>Loved Harrah's new hotel What a beautiful hotel. I've also stayed at the Ritz in Phoenix and this hotel was equally nice, if not nicer. The staff was always cordial. The service could not have been better. I'll be back.

<Content>One of the Best Experiences at a Hotel Just spent 4 days at this beautiful new hotel. The service and quality rate the same as any 5 Star property. I felt like I was at a Ritz Carlton. The staff goes above and beyond. Room Service is prompt and correct. The room was very spacious, contemporary and clean. The bathroom was also very spacious, marble floors. Great view of the Mississippi River. Direct access via a walkway to the casino and convenient to area restaurants and the French Quarter. Can't wait to visit again.

<Content>Great hotel Great hotel, rooms large and clean, bathrooms very nice. Staff was helpful and friendly. They actually appeared happy to help and never failed to say thanks for coming to New OrleansThe hotel had a small fire the second night of our stay. So we had to leave the next morning. Harrahs staff made arrangements for guests to move to he Hilton just down the street. The staff handled the entire ordeal very well. Hope to stay again on our next visit.
