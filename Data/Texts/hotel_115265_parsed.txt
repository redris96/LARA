<Content>Avenue Plaza is Okay The room was spacious on the line of efficiency with a stove, microwave and refrigerator but the bathroom was very small. They are renovating the bathrooms with new fixtures but that won't change the size. There is very little room for toiletries. The beds were very comfortable - we slept like babies. Unfortunately the room only has one lamp which made the room dark in the evening. The room also didn't have a full length mirror. The only mirror was in the bathroom. I called downstairs for an additional lamp and because they were sold out, none were available. The staff was knowledgeable and very helpful. The restaurant was closed which we found to be odd considering the Bayou Classic being held and the hotel being sold out.

<Content>What a PERFECT location!!! I'd like to start by saying that this is my 2nd time in New Orleans but my first at the Avenue Plaza. We didn't book the room directly. We booked through Interval as part of the time share program my family belongs to. With that out the way...I LOVED it.. It was the perfect location.. As it's been previously stated, the rooms were clean, street car RIGHT in front of the hotel to take you to the French Quarter...(and it runs pretty often until well after midnight so you'll always have a ride back..EXACT CHANGE is a must though!). There are bars right next door that have food. There are also several other restaurants right within walking distance (fast food and actual restaurants). There's a, well, not really sure they they CALL it a supermarket when it's no bigger than my corner stores back here in NY.. but nonetheless, it's there on the corner of Avenue Plaza so that you can purchase your groceries being that all the rooms have kitchens with full size fridge and a stove top (no ovens though). If i had to pick something i didn't like, there would be 2 things. One, it's a pretty big hotel with i think 13 floors (not sure how many rooms on each floor but i know it's quite a bit), but there's only 3 washers and 3 dryers for the ENTIRE BUILDING.. Therefore, using the laundry facilities towards the end of your stay was strictly survival of the fittest!!...(You MIGHT find an available machine between midnight and 4am!! ) The 2nd thing i wasn't as thrilled about...(i read others say the small bathroom.. but lets face it, i was never planning on having a party in there so...) my problem was the pots and pans!!!. I didn't like the fact that they weren't non-sticking pans. I had to make like half a dozen eggs every day just to make sure we'd get the equivelent of 2 scraped out of the pan!!. I tried coating it myself with Pam..but that didn't really seem to help all that much. I think with as much money as that place must rake in, they might want to invest in non stickwear things!! Otherwise, i had a great time and i'd stay there ANYTIME i go to New OrleansI should however point out that i discovered while i was there (during a timeshare owners meeting they had one morning), that for anyone owning a 2 or more bedroom place.. The Avenue Plaza only has studios and 1 bedrooms.. Timeshare companies tell you that when you exchange your home base to somewhere else, that you're suppose to get a comparably equivelent place.. But again, they only have studios and 1 bedroom.. Plan accordingly if you're use to anything bigger. I however was on my honeymoon and therefore we only needed the 1 bedroom so it suited my purposes. They do have couchbeds for a second bed option though.

<Content>Timeshare Owner Since 1999 Date:10/30/08My hubsand and I are timeshare holders at the Avenue Plaza.We have been owner since 07/1999. I called two days agoregarding an exchange . The Manager said that we could notbook an exchnage due to all rooms were booked up for the yearat the Avenue Plaza.I told the manager that we had floating weeks for the year .He said it was nothing he could do , that we had lost our week for the year and many other holders because they did not book early in the year. I told him that I have never had a problem getting exchange and was never notified that we had to bank a week early into the year .I ask him what he could do in order for me and my hubsand to get an exchange to another resort. He said we could call RCI and purchase their plan . I ask him how much was the plan he said he did not know. My hubsand and I go through Intreval International for our vacation. and was never notified that we could use other timeshare holder for exchanges. I am reaching out to all timeshare holder that are being jerked around by the Avenue Plaza. I would like for the Vice Presidentand other VP's of the resort know how their customers are being treated.

<Content>We loved it! My husband and I stayed at Avenue Plaza as part of a timeshare exhange. Our room was clean and very comfortable. The bathroom is somewhat small but clean. It was convenient to have access to the streetcar directly across from the hotel. It takes you directly to the French Quarter at Bourbon and Canal Street. Make sure you have 1.25 exact change. The staff is very helpful recommending places to eat and giving directions on how to get around New Orelans. The hotel is conveniently located near a Visitor's Center which provildes information on tours and places to eat, It is worth you while to drop in. There are laundry facilties on the every other floor and computers are available with internet. There were three, but one broke down and it was taken away for repair. The staff is super friendly and helpful. It is not a five star place, but it was very clean and roomy for the two us. We look forward to staying again and highly recommend the Avenue Plaza if you plan on visiting. It is nice because it is away from the loud and crowded French Quarter and the Garden District (the area the hotel is located) is very beautiful and safe.

<Content>Nice hotel My husband, 3 year old son, and I stayed here in April. We stayed as guests through a time share exchange program. The hotel was very nice. Our room was very clean and had a separte bedroom, living room, stove, microwave, and full size refrigerator along with pots and pans. It was nice being able to cook a few breakfasts/lunches during our stay. There was also a washer/dryer on our floor. The best part was the beautiful courtyard in the back and the pool area. The pool was warm and very clean. It was nice and quiet. There was also free wireless internet in the first floor common area along with free coffee. We also loved that the street car stop was right across the street. The hotel was located on St. Charles street about 10 minutes (by street car) to the French Quarter and 10 minutes (by street car) to Audobon Park/Zoo. We took the street car everywhere. There were a few good restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. The Cheesecake Bistro was very good (the BEST hurricanes) and there was a popular breakfast place (The Trolley Stop) a block away. There was also a little market next door which sold groceries, beer, wine, and visitor passes for the street car. I would recommend getting the pass since the street car only takes exact change and having a pass was very convenient and economical. We had a wonderful stay!

<Content>excellent hotel stayed at this hotel in early march and had a truly great experience. cablecar stops directly outside the hotel and we had no problem with checking in before 12pm. rooms are very spacious and have a fully equiped kitchenette. large size gym and beauty spa on the ground floor together with a free laundry service available to all guests. some great eateries and bars in a 2block radius and perched in the lovely garden district makes this must stay hotel.

<Content>Very pleasant stay Great hotel. My wife and I showed up at 11:30 PM for the BCS championship game. Our original hotel was oversold, and they contacted the Avenue Plaza. The staff was very nice. The room was nicely appointed, with a refrigerator, stove, and coffee pot. The bathroom was small, but everything worked; it was clean, and the bed was comfortable. We could have spent a lot more and gotten a lot less.

<Content>Great Relaxing Location for NO, LA This was my second stay here, once in 03 or 04 and now. There are changes after the hurricane. The resort was closed for a year or more and cleaned up. It is an older building, the rooms are very nice and large, but...the bathrooms are small and from the 1950's! It may be old, but was very clean and comfortable. The staff was great, all of them 5 star. The spa was still closed, the roof hot tub was closed and the streetcars were closed! But still loved my stay here as much as the first time. The spa, hot tub and streetcars were to be running by fall. There are no activities there while we were there as they are still looking for staff. It is 22 blocks to the French Quarter, $1.25 by bus (streetcar when running) and about $7 by cab. Parking was $12 a day, there are a few spots on the side streets. We loved the pool (if it was heated, it was set for 65!) and just setting on the overhang on the 1st floor over St. Charles Street, having a glass of wine and watching the people walk, drive by. There is a cover over the over-hang so even in the rain, we enjoyed being outside there. All rooms are now no smoking. Wi-fi was in the computer room, 2 computers and printers, and in the nice lobby. We will be back to NO and will stay there again. Our room was in back and very quiet. Is this a new deluxe hotel / timeshare? No, but it is a great building with character and charm. A good place to set back and relax, or recover from a night in the French Quarter!

<Content>Great place! The Avenue Plaza is a great place to rest your feet after a long day in NOLA. Only bummer is currently the St. Charles Streetcar is not running, so cab fare to and from the quarter is high. (The bus runs somewhat regularly and is a 1.25 each way). Rooms are very clean and staff is super helpful. My only complaints- the lack of wireless or internet access in rooms, and the loud A/C unit in the rooms. Was also difficult to view the Ashley house as the concierge staff was not able to leave the desk to show us, so we missed out :( All in all, a nice place to stay - not the ritz carlton, but not a hole! Kitchen in rooms is very convenient and garden district area is serene and safe! The friendly (and cute) door men will make you smile!

<Content>A convenient option I have stayed at this hotel twice - once back in May of 2000, and most recently in March of 2005. I do not own a timeshare here, but the company with which we have a timeshares offers getaways here.The rooms are okay. The first time I had a single room, the second a 1 bedroom suite. It was clean and quiet. The facilities are not the newest, but functional. Having the kitchenette is very convenient. There is a grocery store on the corner, for essentials. The single overlooked the pool in the rear, and the suite overlooked St. Charles Ave., but on the 7th floor, was high enough to have a nice view of the bridge, and you could watch the ships on the Mississippi, miles away.I recommend this location for those who do not need to be in the French Quarter every minute of the day. When I go to New Orleans, I'm as interested in attractions at Riverbend or on Magazine Street as I am in the Vieux Carr茅. The Avenue Plaza puts me within reasonable distance from all of these. The streetcar stops right at the corner. When streetcar service is backed up, there is also a taxi dispatch right nearby, so it doesn't take long to get a cab. Also there is a Visitor's center a block away.I've never used the spa facilities. The first time I went, I used the hot tub on the roof, but it was closed on my last visit.In March, on my last day, there was a fire in the hotel. The alarm system woked well, and management handled everything smoothly. My floor was not affected, so we were only displaced for about 90 minutes.Overall, it's a reasonable place to stay.

<Content>Location, Location, and Amentities New Orleans reviews are always in the eyes of the the beholder. The city can be seen as a jewel, or some people see it as old or dirty. The people who think New Orleans is dirty have that Depression era mentality that new is clean, and old is dirty.Well, the Avenue Plaza is not brand new, but it is going through some updates. We are timeshare owners at the Avenue Plaza, but have never stayed there (We always used it as a trade). We had to go to New Orleans for a wedding, and one of the benefits of ownership is the ability to book a few nights as a hotel stay at a discounted rate. (A nice perk). Check in was quick, and so was check out. Car service (valet) was quick. It costs $18 per day, but only $8 per day if an owner (another perk). I waited only a few minutes each time.The room had two queen beds, a refridgerator, microwave, coffee maker, two burner stove, dishwasher, in room safe, table and chairs, and a TV. Rooms have been updated and are bigger than other rooms I have stayed in in New Orleans. Bathroom was not huge, but fine. Had a hairdryer, iron and board. Water needed to run a long time before it got hot, but got there.The Spa was all booked up for treatments on Saturday, but had openings at any other time. The thing I loved about our stay was this workout facility. It had a couple of bikes (with built in TVs), stair machines, assorted machines and free weights. The wet area had a dry sauna, a steam room, a whirlpool jaccuzzi, and outdoor heated pool. Towel service was included. I think the use of the workout area has a small fee, but is free for owners (perk, again!) The facility is not brand new, but it is functional. And it was nice to sweat out the impurities before replacing them the next day in the French Quarter.Access to the streetcar is FANTASTIC!!!!!!! It stops right out front. And the Avenue Plaza is close enough to the CBD and the Quarter that even if the car stops at every stop, it won't take long to or from the Quarter. This is the reason you should stay here. If you have never been to New Orleans and you stay in or near the Quarter, you might not get Uptown at all and missout the beautiful architecture of the Garden District and University areas. The trolley ride in both direstions is manageable from The Avenue Plaza. If you stay in the Quarter, it is one long ride to many destinations up the line. I would rather stay right where you are at the Avenue Plaza. And I've been to New Orleans about 30 times over my lifetime.The Avenue Plaza has a nice steakhouse and small bar in the lobby. We did not eat there, but it is big with the locals. The closest bar not on sight is right next door, The venerable Uber-dive bar IGORS, and walking distance a a good breakfast place called the Trolley Stop. Great stuffed omelette. The Pontchartrain Hotel is next door and has a nice bar. We have stayed there too. But the Avenue Plaza is a winner. It isn't the Ritz Carlton. But I don't think you get a workout facility like this at the Ritz. I recommend this hotel if you do not require perfection, but functionality and location.

<Content>I own a timeshare there... I have stayed at the Avenue Plaza for several years because I bought a timeshare there in 1997. The comments about the walls-and-ceilings needing work were correct, but it didn't affect my enjoyment of New Orleans, in any way. Its location (Garden District) puts it in a charming and safe-looking part of town, but you do need to catch the trolley (stops right in front of the hotel) to get to the CBD or French Quarter. Several good restaurants are within easy walking distance. There is a nice steakhouse within the building Service at the Avenue Plaza was probably at its worst just-before the renovations. Since the hotel was partially (often mostly) closed, staffing was not at its normal levels. The Hotel changed-owners in 2003, which was good for the renovation-needs. I have found the new Owners to be responsive to needs, so far. This isn't a five-star hotel, it is a three-or-four star hotel with a relaxed location in a beautiful town. The Pro-spa is four-stars. The room sizes-and-facilities are four-stars. The building is 55 years old, and now has some needed renovations. There are more glamorous locations with closer proximity to CBD and French Quarter, but this is a hotel for people that want to mix NO's excitement with some relaxing downtime.

<Content>never again Stayed here for thanksgiving. We were supposed to have a non-smoking room but the room they gave us was clearly a smoking room. When we asked to change rooms, they gave us a lot of attitude and said things like, well, its a non-smoking room and someone must have smoked in there. When I said that there was an ashtray in the room, the front desk person said that someone must have requested it. I found it interesting that one could request an ashtray in a non-smoking room.They finally moved us, but in the transition, I left a pair of shoes behind (my fault, of course). By the time I realized they were missing, the shoes had dissappeared from the room. The front desk said that housekeeping did not find any shoes. Yeah, right!To make the stay less inviting, housekeeping staff yelled at each other down the hallway as they cleaned at 8:00am each morning. It made it rather difficult to sleep to say the least. The ONLY positive thing that I could say about this place was that the location was perfect for getting around and right next to the street car stop.I'm not terribly picky about hotels, but the attitude of the staff as a whole would dissuade me from staying at this place ever again.

<Content>A So-So Experience We stayed at the Avenue Plaza Hotel last March. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite which was sorely in need of some work. Paint was peeling, walls were scuffed, some lights worked, some didn't, the remote controls worked only sometimes. The bathroom was the worst, hardly any room to put cosmetics or anything else. The service here isn't fabulous. Several times we asked the evening clerk for directions, to which she responded somewhat nastily, Why would you want to go there? When we actually made it to 'there' (Magazine Street) we were thankful that we didn't take her advice to just stay in our little corner of the Garden District. By the way, Magazine Street has wonderful, wonderful little stores, cafes, and galleries. Definatly worth the trip. Also, we were two couples sharing a room. Every day we'd have to call down to get a 4th set of towels as EVERY day they would leave us only 3 even though we kept telling them we would need 4 sets everyday and asked them to note it in housekeeping. This is a mild inconvenience, but annoying to have to keep calling. The location is great, close enough to the French Quarter via Trolley to enjoy the action there, but far enough away to have some peace and quiet when you needed it. It goes without saying that the Garden District is lovely. We spent at least two days strolling around looking at the architecture. Overall, this place is fine to stay at, but nothing fabulous. The kitchen is nice if you aren't interested in always eating out. However, if this was where I owned Timeshare, I'd be very upset at how they are keeping up the property.

<Content>Wonderful, but needs work! We stayed at the Avenue in April with my entire family for my cousin's wedding. First of all, we booked the room from ratestogo and got our room for $100 less (highly recommend that site if you are booking at the last minute)! Then upon arriving at the hotel and seeing our room, we were astonished. We had a full kitchen untensils and all with a dining room table and 4 chairs. In the living room, there was a fold out couch. The bedroom was seperate. Both the living room and the bedroom had huge windows overlooking St. Charles Avenue  the streetcar which stopped right in front of the hotel. The bathroom wasn't huge, but it also had a window (a small one) overlooking the Avenue. Granted, the rooms all needed work done, paint etc. but that was a small price to pay for such a wonderul location  comfort. Did I mention, my family members who paid at least $50 more than we did, didn't even have a seperate bedroom  living room? We really got lucky! This is a great hotel to stay in if you want to enjoy all of New Orleans. For $1.50 you can ride the trolley down to the French Quarter, drink all you want, and ride the trolley back home! No drinking and driving. Also, if you have never seen it, the Garden Disctrict is BEAUTIFUL! I believe the hotel is going through extensive renovations right this moment, and will be shut down until at least August, but we WILL return and stay there again in October!

<Content>I had my wedding here!!!! My husband and I have actually stayed at this hotel twice, and had 2 great experiences. We stayed the first time in order to tour the hotel in consideration for having our wedding there. We loved the staff, and the food was excellent. They even let us sample foods so that we could choose what we wanted to have. Other hotels in New Orleans have set menus that you choose from w/no other alternatives or prices. Nevertheless, we decided to have the wedding at Avenue Plaza. It was a wonderful experience. Our rooms were very nice and clean. No paint chipping in the bathrooms, bad smells, etc. We had a wonderful champagne gift basket awaiting us when we arrived, and the staff made sure we and our guests were comfortable (and even discounted our rates further than originally quoted!). The wedding was beautiful. The caterer was really organized and helpful. The courtyard and antebellum home in the back were the perfect setting for a New Orleans wedding. They also put white lights in the trees and made sure all the tables and chairs were organized and ready for us to have decorated. This in combination with our own wedding decor (flowers, chair covers, etc) made for an amazing atomosphere. We had no complaints from any our wedding guests, only compliments on the hotel and on the awesome food provided by catering. And, in comparison to other hotels who do wedding in New Orleans, the price was great. It must really depend on the room you have as to whether or not you have a good experience. I think we were all mostly on the 12th floor (if I remember correctly). Maybe the rooms on some of the other floors aren't as nice, but ours were great. I definitely recommend giving it a try!

<Content>A great experience I recently traveled to New Orleans and stayed at the Avenue Plaza Hotel and spa. We had a one and two bedroom suites, both with full kitchen. This was a great addition, the kitchen was stocked with pots and pans and utensils, great addition when traveling. The hotel and our rooms were clean. We enjoyed the pool and rooftop whirlpool and sundeck. It may not be the newest hotel(but many in new orleans are not) but it was kept up and clean. Dont pay to park we always found street parking nearby. Great location, right on the streetcar line, and close to everything. The best part is the price we stayed for 75$ a night during the French Quarter Festival, it was one of the best prices around, and for a suite that is great. I will try to stay here next time I travel to New Orleans.

<Content>Hang on to your valuables! My son stayed at this hotel with the Bands of America to perform in the Sugar Bowl. He put his brand new Game Boy on charge when he left the room. When he came back, the room had been cleaned-- of dirt and of his Game Boy. The manager gave me every indication that they would try to compensate him in some way but then never did and would not respond to my calls or emails. They also did not respond in any way to the Better Business Bureau complaint.

<Content>The two faces of Avenue. We were guest on March 22  23. Like others, I was concerned about our choice of this hotel. I traveled with our 11 year old daughter and the reviews I read after booking the hotel ranged from good to terrible. The hotel must have two personalities. Luckily, we had an excellent experience. We stayed in room 1222. Our room was very large, clean, no smells, nice decor and pleasant staff. We were not contacted about the time share. The room's kitchenette allowed my daughter to have oatmeal for breakfast each morning, and we popped corn in the microwave to feed to the ducks at city park. The location is great. We used the trolley to the zoo and back to Canal street. Took the AAA self guided tour of the garden district which starts within a block of the hotel.Our experience was great. I would go back there again..but I would want the same room.

<Content>St. Patrick's Day - Great Stay/Location/Reasonable Price We stayed here March 11, 12 and 13, 2004. Location was great: easy access to streetcar, away from French Quarter noise and large room with full refigerator, microwave and stove-top elements and next door to the famous Pontchartrain Hotel.We stayed on the top floor - easy access to rooftop jacuzzi and views (not used but looked clean/enjoyable), no waiting for elevators (a potential problem for lower floors as hotel was busy) and good city views from our room. Downside: paint was peeling on ceiling (not noticed on lower floor rooms we happened to see) and a musty smell on floor though not in the room. May have been a smoking room (not sure but something was there - okay to us non-smokers but nevertheless something was there).Found rooms to be of a good size and generally comfortable. We had a double queen with adjoining bathroom and make-up room. Conversations in the adjoining room could be heard through a connecting door in the make-up room but were not objectionable (the fact we had a separate make-up room was a plus). One of the queen beds was slightly broken (we heard this was the same thing in the adjoining room!) but this didn't interfere with our sleep etc.Had no pressure whatsoever from time share sales and in fact would not have known this was also a timeshare destination if not for trip advisor and the fact that a noticeable number of tours were being conducted of the hotel.We booked through the hotel's own website and received a discounted room for a multiple night stay (US$75/night plus tax for 2 adults and 1 child though rates could be double+ this for other nights). We did have a room rate problem that was ultimately resolved to our satisfaction. We had booked two nights on-line and then called the hotel directly to extend this for an extra night. When we checked mid-stay they were charging us $150/night and based on initial discussions with the Manager this was going to be a big problem to correct as they had us recorded at a $150/night rate by a third party reservation agency (yes, the same one their own web site referred us to!) and could do nothing about this. Luckily, I had printed out the confirmation receipt and was able to show that the rate was $150 for two nights, not one! After that, no problems but we could see how this would have been difficult without evidence!We ate a Copeland's Cheesecake - good food though a long wait to get in. St Paddy's Day parade was within a block of the hotel (a real plus and a key point for our five year old who enjoyed this and the 20 pounds of necklaces etc. we collected immensely - watch out for the flying cabbages though!)Without question we would stay again at this hotel for the rate quoted. As a family, we would have liked even an extra night to see everything as this was not possible - Zoo and Aquarium worth a visit and of course the French Quarter. The Visitour transit passes (available nearby) made everything easy to get to though were probably not a big saving in the end (consider getting these for a day rather than 3 day block we did as there was no extra savings). Martin Wine Store was a few streetcar stops away (just off of St. Charles) and worth the trip.We did not make it to the Children's Museum and the nearby Lafayette cemetery was closed during our Sunday visit. Good restaurants nearby (including a Houston's, plus Copeland's and fast food/Subway etc.) as well as a large Walgreens's pharmacy etc. French Quarter easily accessible by streetcar (we ate at Buba Gump's Seafood which was fun and good value for your money as the portions were huge).No safety/security issues noted.All in all, a very good place to stay!

<Content>Bad Experience at the Avenue Plaza We stayed at the Avenue Plaza the weekend of March 12-14. We traveled down with two law students who were participating in an event at Loyola. I had requested and received confirmation for two rooms - one two queen room and one king room, both non-smoking. We arrived and were told that we had two one bedroom suites which were apparently on the 11th floor. I explained that we needed a room with two beds for the law students. The desk clerk said they had no such rooms and when I showed him my reservation confirmation he became annoyed. He then assigned us to two one bedroom suites on the 6th floor. The rooms were awful. The paint was peeling off the ceilings in the bathrooms, the rooms had not been cleaned, the carpet was so dirty it was sticky, and the pull out sofa was a poor excuse for a bed - the mattress was torn and filthy, the sheets were stiff and stained, etc. Needless to say, the person who slept on that bed got no sleep on Friday. On Saturday they moved us to the second floor. The room was a little better, but nothing to write home about. The manager and the day clerk were extremely courteous. We travel a lot and I have never stayed in a hotel room that looked like the ones we had. I've stayed a lot of places in N.O. and never had a room like these. I am a very flexible person but even I would still think twice about ever staying there again, at any price.

<Content>Stay here I'm agreeing with the March 3rd review. As that person was, I was actually SCARED after I had booked my reservation and then found out about Trip Advisor! However- this hotel was EXCELLENT! The lobby was clean and the staff was gracious and knowledgable. The room was clean and spacious and having a fridge was great! I never heard the timeshare presentation and never felt pressured to buy anything. The price was right ($99/night) and it was close to everything (if you stay here- Copeland's Cheesecake Bistro is walking distance- excellent food and alot of it!). There's also a market on the corner- good for picking up last minute liquor and buying a 3-day streetcar pass. Staying in the Garden District is good for 20-somethings who like it quiet when they sleep but also need to get to the Universities to see friends and have easy access to the French Quarter for nite activities. (Also- for Real World fans- about three blocks away going towards the universities is Belfort Mansion- although you have to look carefully b/c it doesn't look as great as it once did- I missed it on my first streetcar ride!) Whoever said this hotel was horrible must be used to staying at the Ritz because this place was excellent!

<Content>Are y'all on drugs? After reading the reviews on this site AFTER we'd made our reservations I was really scared. But we got there and it was great! It didn't smell bad, we were never asked to hear the time-share presentation, the bathroom was clean, the halls were at least 4 feet wide, and the staff was friendly. It wasn't even what I'd call 'ghetto chic' as someone else said it was. If we'd stayed longer, the kitchen would have been very useful, as it is we only used the fridge. It was a very good location; we bought the 3-day trolley/bus pass and went to the French Quarter and the Museum of Art. We also walked through the garden district (the hotel is about 5 blocks from Anne Rice's house) to Magazine Street where there was tons of great shopping.

<Content>Stay away .... Very disappointed in general about the entire place. First, it is a timeshare. That says alot right there... after 3 or 4 calls to the room to sell us the place, they quite calling. Twice, the room was not made up, and one night the entire hotel did not have hot water. The rooms are small, and with only one restuarant (which was closed 4 times for private functions) we ate at the surrounding hotels for dinner. The bathroom facilities were old to say the least, with wallpaper peeling, missing lamps, and a TV that turned everything green and looked like you were looking through a fish tank. Not much I can say, if you enjoy a nice place to stay, with atmosphere inside and out, this is not the place!

<Content>Pleasant change from other hotels in New Orleans The suite was great, after staying at another high priced and well known hotel, this place was a pleasant change. The last hotel room was small, dirty, under construction throughout the facility, very poor room service, and let's not talk about the view and broken coffee pot. THE AVEUNE PLAZA in comparison was clean, the suite was big, I loved the kitchen, the idea of a separate bedroom, hallways were clean and staff was friendly and helpful, the hottub on the roof top was beautiful uner the stars at night. The Garden District was wonderful, a wonderful location, streetcar right in front of the hotel. In the downtown area there was a stabbing of one youth to another, I could not believe all these expensive well known hotels were in this part and town and people were paying big bucks. The Garden District was dream compared to Canal street, but at the same time so close to the French Quarter, zoo, boardwalk, it is a great place.

<Content>Voodoo lives here This place was just awful. It is under construction..hopefully Fairfield Resorts will salvage this dump. The rooms have stained carpets, rust on the appliances and ceiling. My daughter stayed on a floor where it smelled like someone had been smoking reefer. I used a timeshare week to rent this place, and I really regret it.

<Content>Ghetto fabulous Some time ago, I read a review here that described a hotel as ghetto fabulous and that monicker fits this hotel very well. It's not the best hotel I have ever stayed in, but it's a step or two above Motel 6, Best Western, or most budget properties.First...what I liked. The room had a full kitchen, it was clean, and had all the accoutrements you would expect at a business class hotel. The hotel was convenient to the St. Charles street car line for easy access to the French Quarter. There are near by restaraunts, liquor stores, grocery store, etc. The price is right - $130 a night, compared to much higher room rates elsewhere.Only a few disappointments. As others have mentioned, the elevators are noisy. I sleep like a rock so it wasn't so much a problem for me, but my travel companion didn't much care for the noise. The mattress was stiff and a little uncomfortable. Finally - stay away from the attractions desk in the lobby. The property is a time share and they are very pushy about giving you free gifts for attending their presentation. Even when you are very direct about not being interested they continue to push. No really, I'm not interested at all. Please stop talking to me!Restaraunt - The restaraunt in the lobby is worth a stop. The service isn't the best, but the rib eye is one of the best cuts of beef I have eaten in a long time.Would I stay at this property again? I would consider it, yes. It's not the best hotel in New Orleans, but for the price and location it's definately ghetto fabulous!

<Content>Not bad Not the best hotel in New Orleans, but for the price not bad. Friendly staff, easy valet parking. Room could use plenty of updating. Best Feature: Shower heads are not water-saver type, Showering is like it used to be yeasr ago ....

<Content>Never stay at this hotel Some friends and I stayed at this hotel from 7/31-8/3 and it was the absolute worst. We were told that the rate was so reasonable because it was the off season but it was horrendous. The housekeeping staff was terrible. We were actually ASKED if we wanted our bathroom cleaned. The tub backed up while showering so you actually were standing in this dirty water while rushing to shower to get out of there. This so-called maintenance man came and pulled all the gunk out of the drain with his bare hands whic was totally gross and as a consequence, 2 of us caught Athlete's Foot! We had to ask for clean towels twice. The entire floor we were on smelled terrible!

<Content>a nice change Our first room was awful rm # 1004 backed to the elevators, old loud elevators. You could hear everything being said on all 3 of them. Room was in bad need of repair too. We asked for another room they only had smoking rooms left. I checked it out and it was wonderful clean, quite, nice, view, AND it didn't smell!!!_ the staff couldn't have been nicer. Easy to get around town by cable car Yes ,I would stay there again.

<Content>Never Again Not a big fan. Small rooms and below average food. Overpaid in rate. Staff was not what I'm used to when on vacation.

<Content>Good place, Good price. The Avenue Plaza is a good bet for the price. It is right on the streetcar line ($12 for a 3 day unlimited pass) and right next to Igor's which you will quickly learn to love as your pre, post and anywhere in between favorite watering hole and laundromat. Some of the cheapest Abita in town! The pool is a nice perk although there is little lounging room around it but there is a sundeck on the roof with a great view of the city and a hot tub which was not functional when we were there. Our fold-out sofa was close to inexcusable as a bed however so you might consider checking it out right away. The one bedroom suites are the way to go for 2 couples splitting the bill. The staff was great, one of our favorite bands was staying at the hotel and it is hard to beat the a/c shuttle directly to JazzFest (although if you master the bus system and don't mind waiting in line a bit, you can save yourself $10 a day). It does take some time to get to the French Quarter and even longer to get home in the wee hours of the night via the streetcar but it IS New Orleans and you have to take things slow anyway. It is a perfect jumping off point for exploring the rest of the Garden District, Lafayette Cemetary, Magazine Street and Uptown. Bring your walking shoes!
