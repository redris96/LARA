<Content>not 5 star! we booked to stay in the ocean view suites at the grand mirage on an all inclusive basis... on arrival we were disappointed with the simple and old reception area - though i guess somewhat authentic. we were shown to our rooms efficiently, which were spacious and very traditional. the description of the suites on their website states that these include a dining table - which we wanted as there was a large group of us. no dining table - and when i asked the manager, i was told that only 1 of the suites has this and this is why they state this on their website?!?!anyway the rooms were ok, but a lot of mosquitoes so we had to buy a spray to keep them away. the first night we all got at least 4 bites whilst sleeping. the bathrooms are huge, sadly the bath and shower are poor. the shower dribbles, with more water spraying across onto the shower wall than down onto you, and the bath dribbles even slower taking 40MINUTES to fill half up?! when we complained we were told that this was normal... Halfway through the holiday, the shower head fell onto my brothers head when he switched on the shower. When we called the manager, we were informed that this was not through any fault of theirs, and that it was likely due to his height - which is less than 6ft?! they begrudgingly apologised and fixed it the following day...ok the electricity... i took my hairdrier with me, as i do everywhere... within about a minute of turning it on the electrics blew!!! several hours later the maintenance team turned up at the door, and decided that it was due to the hairdrier and said i could not use it. after several arguments they provided me with an alternative hairdrier, which subsequently caused a power cut everytime that or a kettle was turned on! no more than an apology and blame on the original hairdrier... not at all impressive...the food is ok, nothing to shout out about. however we all got diarrhoea and stomach aches after the first day, so i will let you decide if this was due to the food... the menus were pretty basic but i suppose this may be expected... the drinks were ok, the cocktails good, and no complaints here...the swimming pool looks bigger than it is, and for half the day it is occupied by aquaaerobics and volleyball, so there is not much room to swim in it. the bit that remains free is 1.6m deep, so this is not so good for kids... it was difficult to get sunbeds if you went down after 9am, but the pool staff were happy to remove towels from unoccupied beds - which is good if u are looking for a bed, but not if you have left your bed for a few mins...overall? i guess you get what you pay for but i would not recommend this hotel at all. the staff are delightful and do what they can to help. but it needs to refurbished and their electrics and water need serious sorting out...

<Content>Very nice, but communication lacking. I stayed in a deluxe, ocean view room at the Grand Mirage over Christmas/New Year on the all-inclusive, 'gold', 鈥榠nternet special' package booked directly with the hotel.The room was very good (more ocean 'glimpses' than 'view') with a nice balcony overlooking the pool. Housekeeping kept it spotless; and in general, the bar, food and laundry services were excellent. However, it seems they have two types of all-inclusive 'gold' packages: the internet special (which I booked), and the regular, 'gold' package (which does not include as many amenities/'perks'). For example, part of my package was a full day, island tour with lunch. When I enquired about booking it, I was told tours are not included. After much discussion and showing the assistant manager the website, I got my tour... only to find out on the tour that the guide expected me to pay for lunch (I didn't but the guide had to make many phone calls to get it straightened out). Cigarettes were also included, but every time I went to get a pack, I was told they weren't - this went on for my whole, ten-day stay. It seems the staff (and even some management) were not informed there are two different types of 'gold' all-inclusive packages. At times, it was quite frustrating!In hindsight, I would not book an all-inclusive package again - there's no incentive to leave the hotel and do things. All-inclusive is convenient but expensive - you have to consume a lot (even at inflated 'hotel' prices) to make it worthwhile.Would I stay at the Grand Mirage again? Sure... but only in a 'room with breakfast'.

<Content>Great place for a vacation I and my wife stayed at the Grand Mirage Resort this November. I must say it was a thoroughly satisfying experience right from the beginning. We were upgraded to the Romantic Ocean View room on arrival. We did have to wait for some time while the room was readied; in the meantime we were given our welcome drinks. The whole staff and I mean each and everyone we interacted with was very very friendly.The room was good - neat, clean and spacious. It had a balcony which faced the ocean on one side and the pool on another. The hotel itself is huge and beautifully landscaped. There is a waterfall, lots of greenery and lots of sculptures. It has its own private beach (although it is not too clean and hence going into the water wasn鈥檛 possible), water sports, pools, game rooms, spa, etc. We can鈥檛 comment much on the food since we did not have any meals there except the breakfast, which was a buffet. It was good and had sufficient choice. The other meals too were buffets but the price was on the higher side. But this was more than compensated by the numerous decently priced restaurants bang opposite grand mirage. All in all it was a pleasurable experience and I would recommend the place to anyone whether they are going for their honeymoon or with a group of friends or with their families.

<Content>Hotel Fair, Food Not Good. I have alrady posted this review once already. But for some reason better known to someone, it was taken off. So here it is again. Surely I have as much say as the next person.The Hotel itself was very good, as were the staff. Very clean and very friendly. People were always helpful and no request was ever to much trouble... However, on the other hand, it has to be said that the food, very much left a lot to be desired. Everything was based upon a buffet style. Nothing particularly wrong in that itself, except most of the stuff that we personally exeperienced on a daily basis consisted of apparently, rehashed, reheated same old, same old. When ever we would roll back the metal covers where the hot food was kept, we were invariably faced with a dried up, coagulated looking mass, which as time went on, we found increasingly unable to face. Mealtimes were never an experience we particularly looked forward to at the best of times, as items such as pastries, rolls and fresh fruit etc. were always covered over with cling film or netted covers, which were rarely replaced properly by guests, resulting in a congregating fly problem, some of which would become trapped beneath these covers rendering everything most unappetizing.Luckily we found that we had a great selection of good quality and varied local restaraunts to hand, either within adjoining hotels or independent ones within the local area, which it didn't take us long to discover, where we were able to enjoy some exceedingly good food at reasonable prices...On our return to the UK, both myself and my wife have come to the conclusion that after experiencing an all inclusive holiday such as this, we will certainly not be repeating the experience anytime soon. It seems to us that once the holiday Company have safely secured your money in a situation like this, then the quality of the food which they seem to accept as a decent standard to serve up to their guests, is of little or no concern to them at all. What was on the whole, a welcome stress free fortnight of relaxation, could, as far as we are concerned, been a far better experience had the food situation been of a much better and hygienic standard...he next person.

<Content>FANTASTIC HOLIDAY!! Travelled to the Grand Mirage with my husband and three children (14,12 and 9) in October and had the most fantastic holiday. The hotel is wonderful and we had an upgrade to a sea view room which was beautiful. The room it self had recently been renovated and was spotless, as was the rest of the hotel. The staff are exceptional, each and every one we found to be so friendly and attentive, giving a professional service with a personal touch. We stayed on an all inclusive basis which was incredible value, never have we had an incusive package that included so much. The children were kept busy with all the watersports (motorised inc) while we were pampered with beach side massages and a very generous $140 spa voucher. The food couldn't be faulted. A vast choice on the breakfast buffet and then a choice of either buffet or a la carte in 3 restaurants for lunch and dinner. There was huge selection of drinks available including branded spirits in the evening and the room mini bar. All in all a great family holiday that we enjoyed very much and would definately recommend to others. Can't wait to go back!

<Content>Not my favorite hotel The hotel is constantly busy. I felt like I stepped into the lobby of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. You get the sense this is Disney Bali. Breakfast buffets are a dismal experience so skip them if not included in your room rate. Staff very gracious but concierges seem ever too busy or ill-informed when asked about outstanding restaurants in the area. To stay at this hotel is to miss out on what Bali has to offer.

<Content>LOVE IT BUT!!!!!!!!!! I love my stay at Grand Mirage Hotel, however I'm truly disappointed with the security here. We stay at this hotel from 8th Oct - 12th Oct, I was staying in Room 2236 with a connecting door to room 2237 (We were on our company trip).On 11th October (Saturday) I clearly leaving my digital camera on the dressing table and leave a message privacy at the door from 1pm to 6pm (as we are out for shopping and spa, therefore we do not need to bring our camera along). We leave the room again from 7:20pm to 12:30am and with the sign at the door privacy as we are going to check out the next day, we do not require house keeping to clean our room. I only realize the camera missing as we pack for check out on 12th Oct (Sunday) morning. This person could have come in from room 2237 as we leave the connecting door open at all times. I'm sure like the hotel can check who have the access to the room during this time. I sincerely hope they are looking into this.

<Content>Loved Grand Mirage Nusa Dua My husband and I stayed at the Grand Mirage in Tanjung Benoa - about 5 mins from Nusa Dua - for 6nts. We loved it. The area is nice because it has lots of lovely restaurants right opposite the hotel, there are massage parlors, a supermarket, lots of currency exchanges - which give a better rate than both the airport and the hotel and it has a shuttle to the Bali Collection. The Aston and the Conrad are on the same road. The breakfasts were very nice with a variety of food, and fruit. The staff were very friendly. The room and bathroom were very nice. Beach and poolside facilities very nice. Just don't take a taxi from the hotel or use their tours - they are very expensive. We wanted to go to Jimbaran, we were quoted 80 000 rupiah by the hotel for a one way, we walked outside the hotel and got a taxi for 50 000 rupiah. The same with a taxi to Kuta. The hotel said it was 150 000 return. We got it for 40 000 to Kuta.

<Content>Not a family friendly hotel The 5 stars are local ratings and not at par with international standards - in which case it would have been a 4 star hotel. This place is not a child friendly place as 3 or 4 evenings every week they have a theme evening which basically means that loud music will blast till 10 or 11 pm. Staff has been briefed to be friendly and most probably they genuinely are friendly, however they are not empowered to take actions in your interest. We had 3 different rooms in 10 days.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Just returned back following a 2 week stay to see a friends wedding ceremony :-1) Staff - Could not do enough to help from reception to cleaners to restaurant waiters - with a special mention to the young lady who organised the wedding - you're a star and made my friends day, well done.2)Hotel - Rooms were very comfy and cleaned to a high standard every day, Reception staff were very friendly as was everyone who worked there.3) Food - Absolutely 5 star - never had a bad meal.4) Pool - Very clean5)Beach - Complaint - sand was too hot to walk on, but i suppose i should wear sandals !!!!6)Watersports - everything you need or could want.I would recommend this hotel to eveyone and if it wasn't for the long flight time would love to say i'll be there again next year.

<Content>Disappointing service and attitude This was the second time we stayed at the Grand Mirage (after a very enjoyable stay in 2007) and I must say that we were very disappointed with the service we received on this occasion and will not be going back a third time. We were travelling with two other couples and had requested 3 double ocean view rooms. When we arrived at the hotel about midnight we were informed that all 3 rooms had twin beds and we were very unhappy about this. However the reception staff said that they would rectify this in the morning for us, so as it was so late and we were staying for a week we decided to take them at their word. Well, next morning, we went to organise the new rooms, but of course there had been a change of shifts and no-one knew anything about it. After lots of running around trying to look busy finding something, we were told to come back at 2pm and see someone else who would definitely have rooms available for us. Needless to say that everyone just passed the buck continuously over the next few days, always saying that someone else would fix it. Eventually after being given this runaround we insisted on seeing the manager who took quite a few hours to be available and then was told that no other rooms were available at all and never had been. We were told that the best they could do was push the beds together which in some of the rooms was impossible because of the room setup. In the end after a few days of this and becoming quite angry with the manager we were offered free meal vouchers to compensate, which really did nothing to make up for being told lie after lie about rectifying the situation. We tried to get a refund and go somewhere else, but of course we had paid in full and they had no intention of returning any of our money. All in all I felt that we were treated very badly in respect to this situation especially considering that we were repeat customers. I also find it very hard to believe that in a hotel of this size that not one of the 3 couples could have been relocated to a double room in a week long period. I think that it was just all too hard for anyone to have to deal with. I certainly would not recommend this hotel to anyone now, as there are many more in the area which are similarly priced and have caring, friendly, smiling staff as well.

Beach was ok, with seaweeds most of the time.Everyone very helpful. Front desk wiling to call for guide, massage reservations etc.Too bad there were roaches in my room; but, it is in a tropical area so expected.

<Content>Great hotel! We stayed for 12 nights in a ocean view room in June 2008. Very nice and clean room. Good selection for breakfast. We tried the beach front restaurant, great for lunch and they had two prices for every item on the menu, one for regular size meals and one for small meals. The small portion was more than enough for lunch. Very nice pool and beach area. Although we didn`t travel with kids it seemed to be very family friendly with some kind of big sunlounges with shade reserved for families and a pool for small children. The hotel offers massage at an outdoor pavillion by the pool area for 99.000 rupih for an hour. It was very often full, so it`s a good idea too book when you arrive at the hotel if you know that you will be spending some days by the pool. Great activity program with yoga, water activities etc. The hotel has a taxi counter with fixed prices to Kuta, Seminyak etc. It is a bit more expencive than finding a taxi on the street, but it is very well operated (it says on a sign that it is owned and operated by the local village) and we never waited more than 2 minutes. The best ting about the Grand Mirage was the outstanding service. Everybody who worked there were really nice and helpful. We asked the reception several times to help us with reservations at restaurants and pick up and reservations to tours, spas etc. and they were really helpfulll and did everything with a smile.There are som shops and restaurants just outside the hotel. A 5 minute walk to the left is Bumbu Bali, really nice restaurant with excellent balinese food. The other restaurants outside the hotel that we tried was ok, but not outstanding in any way. There are also a couple of massage places just outside the hotel. We went several times to Alternatif, a very simple place with only curtains to separate customers, but they gave really good massages and it was very cheap.We had several trips to Kuta and Seminyak for shopping and dining while staying at the Grand Mirage, and with traffic it took us up to 45 minutes one way. So if you think that you will be going out every night you might consider staying in Seminyak, Legian or Kuta. We actually stayed in Seminyak later in our holiday and although we loved the shops, restaurants and atmosphere there, we missed the Grand Mirage : )

<Content>Friendly Family Hotel - All Inclusive Option Stayed for one week with family (two teeneagers) using the hotel's All Inclusive internet offer.Very impressed with the actual All Inclusive option. Not only includes room and food/beverages, but even motorised water sports which probably beats most others.Hotel is nice though not spectacular. Our rooms were a bit dated but otherwise fine. Had a romantic sea view room and a standard room. Not sure the money paid extra for the sea view room was worth it. Food on the All Inclusive plan was surprisingly good and varied daily. Buffets often combined with local dance performances and al fresco had a good selection. Did not try the Italian restaurant on premises, but the kids enjoyed room service and we liked the Chinese restaurant next door that was also included in the plan.Water sports equipment is a mixed bag, with hobie cats and water kayaks being quite new and in good shape, while windsurfers and the hotel's speed boat have seen better days. Jet skis were OK. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and welcoming, any issues were promptly addressed.During our stay there were mostly families, mainly from Germany, Japan, Russia and Australia.No real animation programme 脿 la Club Med, but daily activities like pool volley ball or beach socer were a hit with the kids.The beach is not really what you may be thinking of when you imagine Bali or the Tropics - no white sand coves framed by palm trees. Actually, depending on wind and tide you may not even want to swim there because of the reef and also because it does not always appear to be clean. However, this is a problem for all the properties along the Tanjung Benoa/Nusa Dua beach line.I probably would not go back (I rarely go to the same place twice) but had a good time and can recommend it for a relaxing holiday.

They upgraded us upon arrival to a better room and in all our lives we were never treated better. This is a great place and we would highly recommend it to anyone. We can't wait to return. For the best deal contact the hotel directly. They could not have been more accommodating.

Hotel did try and eventually suceeded obtaining peace. Several items went missing a blouse and a bracelet, which was given to me on holiday for my birthday . Gutted and did spoil it a bit but saying that the hotel is paradise and we did have a great time so just go with nothing fancy.

<Content>Good, but not great We stayed at the Grand Mirage for 13 nights. I would rate the hotel a solid 4 star, maybe 4.5. Compaired to 5 star in Mexico or the Carribean. When we arrived, we booked a room with a king size bed, but they put us in a room with 2 single beds. We requested a change and were told it would 2 days. It was nothing to stress about, so we went with it. In 2 days, they did move us, but to a room they knew the air conditioning did not work and it stank of cigarette smoke, so we again complained and they moved us to the third room, which was fine. The only real complaint is that they nickel and dime you to death, for an all inclusive except dinner, you pay for everything. Internet use $4 for 1/2 hour, $4 a day for gym use, the list goes on. We guess that this part of the world has not caught up to the rest. The hotel itself is beautiful and the grounds are kept spotless. The beach is cleaned daily and there is a bit of seaweed along the beach, but it is an ocean, not a pool. The staff are exceptional and will help wherever they can and even go a little bit extra if they can. The meals were good, although we found the buffet at dinner and lunch very expensive, so we ordered off the menu most nights we ate at the hotel, we found the price of the a la carte menu very reasonable, especially for a hotel. There are numerous restaurants all along the street just outside the hotel for few dollars cheaper, ask for a discount before sitting down, we usually got 10 - 20% off. Unfortunately, the outdoor shows were cancelled due to weather, but they moved them inside where they could. If you are doing any touring, deal with Sarisana with Panarama tour group. He is on the second floor lobby area most days between 11 and 12. He will set everything up for you from Scuba diving to white water rafting to daily tours. We spent a few minutes with him a couple times a week and never had to worry about anything. Overall, it was a very good experience and we would stay there again.

<Content>Great and Relaxing Vacation We did select the Grand Mirage based on the many comments you can find in the web and at no stage have we found anything bad about the hotel . We did have a wonderful looking room facing the ocean , the rooms have been cleaned at all time , yes maybe the rooms are not new but you have everything you need and a big balcony . Emoloyyes are very very friendly and help or entertain you at any time. Activities are great , very big beach area , the ocean is as clean as it can get I could not agree with some of the comments about the Ocean and the seaweed , every day we spend at least 2 hours in the see. Breakfast has a wide selection . Overall I must say this hotel is the best Resort I have been within Asia over the past 4 years . Keep it up Grand Mirage

<Content>Loved the Grand Mirage We stayed at the Grand Mirage for 3 weeks in Dec/Jan 08. Overall we had a fantastic time. The rooms were great, very clean, and our view of the ocean was fantastic. As in other reviews, I agree with the seaweed on the ocean front, but the staff does its utmost to keep it clean for the guests. The Pool area was great, but they could use a few more deck chairs around the pool.The food ample and well done. The buffets were plentiful and there was sufficient selection throughout. the a la carte restaurant, La Cascata (Italian cuisine) was phenomenal and we ate there several times and enjoyed our meals thouroughly.As we stayed through Christmas/New Year, the staff pulled out all the stops to ensure that everyone had a great time. The show for New Years was second to none in our travels. The Thallaso spa was also fantastic, both my wife and I went for a massage treatment and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The best thing that can be said about our whole Grand Mirage Experience was the staff. We have never encountered such a helpful, friendly staff in all of our travels. Everyone went the extra mile to ensure that we received the best possible care and all of our wants were addressed in a timely/efficient and courteous manner. All I have to say about the staff, from the Manager down to the kitchen help, was that they were superlative! My wife and I travel extensively and in all our travels, we have never visited a hotel that possessed a staff of that caliber. Well done to all.The sights of Indonesia were also a joy, we visited many of the attractions from the Volcano, Rice terraces, Temples to elephant riding. All in all a fantastic time and I would recommend Bali, and the Grand Mirage to anyone.

<Content>Noise and smell We stayed in Grand Mirage for one week, in an interconnecting room, with two children. Problems started right after arrival. The doors between the rooms could only be opened by force. There was mould in several places in the bathroom and the smells from the toilet bleed over to the living room - no smell-absorbing or ventillating system. The air-conditioner could not be set, night were chilly. The remote for the TV fell apart, etc. The entire place seemed a bit run-down and neglected. We tried to change rooms, but there was no vacancy because of the climate conference. There were constant problems with the towels (i.e. were not replaced, or one or two was missing, to be supplied later). We had some noisy nights due to Russian tourists having fun at 2. a.m. and howling songs. On the plus side, the staff courteous and ready to help.

<Content>We love Bali  My wife  I have spent a wonderful holiday in Grand mirage @ Nusa Dua.The hotel offers good value for $$ - Rooms are beautifully decorated. They even have nice poster beds - adding an air of romance for lovers/ couples.Many water sports is available though during low tide, you'll see some green seaweeds-like floating around. For us, we prefer to suntan at the beach, but swim at the hotel's beautiful pool (located just besides the beach)Many restaurants are located just outside the hotels - but take note the food quality is only so-so thought hey offer great ambience housed ni traditional Bali architecture  decorations. One restaurant called Fat Duck Restaurant offered great Balinese food - specializing is what else but duck specalty, including Balinese crispy duck, duck wanton soups

<Content>Very Nice Hotel but Beach Water Quality Very Lacking Our family of 5 wiht 3 small children under 8 years old stayed in connecting Deluxe seaview rooms for a week. Like most other reviews we read we enjoyed our stay at the hotel very. The staff were helpful, grounds wells maintained and room was ample size with nice views. Pros:-Very well maintained facilites-Nice very large pool -lovely grounds-Nice breafast buffet-Quiter surroundings compared to Kuta beach area-Good selection of open air restaurants cross the street in both direction (walking distance)CON:-Ocean Water Quality: The only real negative worth writing about is the very poor quality of the ocean water at the hotel's beach. It's greenish, cloudy and has lots of seaweed. Not what you come all the way to Bali to see. It seemed like most of the Nusa Dua area that we walked along was like that. All in all we really enjoyed our stay very much and have not regrets but will be looking for a similar quality hotel with better beach/ocean water for our next visit. Enjoy, Kevin

<Content>Fantastic Grand Mirage We have just returned from the Grand Mirage Resort in Bali having stayed there 14 nights after a week in Singapore and Bangkok. It is fair to say that from the very moment we arrived at the hotel the experience of first class service and attention to detail became evident.We stayed in an ocean view deluxe room on an all-inclusive package. The room was very well maintained spotlessly clean and very well furbished. Going out on to the balcony to have the most beautiful and, dare I say it, romantic panoramic view of the ocean. The all-inclusive part of the bargain was faultless, the mini-bar, room service and all restaurants and cafes on-site were refreshingly included. The food production and service was maintained at a very high standard from the afternoon tea to the huite cuisine Italian restaurant.The entertainment was very much Bali culture to modern music and was well structured and managed. The hotel also provided tokens for water sports, both motorised and non-motorised, and the expertly conducted beach massages.The beach was spotlessly clean and was covered by waiting staff taking drink orders. All the towels and sun beds were also provided free of charge.The Thalassic Spa that also sits within the hotel grounds is another sublime facility. The treatments are carried with totally professional expertise in an environment that epitomises relaxation. The hotel also provided a very generous voucher for the all-inclusive guests to partake in this wonderful and relaxing experience.It was the silver wedding anniversary for my wife and I and the hotel staff went out of their way to make things special for us including a beach dinner, a cake and flowers. The holiday of a lifetime was made鈥ust simply that.

<Content>Nice Facilities But Lacks Decent Beach or Amenities We stayed at this hotel for 4 days and 4 nights. It was a hotel with really nice facilities located on Tanjung Benoa and within 5 minutes walking distance of local restaurants, and a convenience store. Note that while the hotel may claim it is on Nusa Dua (or be listed as such on Trip Advisor at time of writing), it is on Tanjung Benoa which is Nusa Dua's ugly cousin. Bali is all about beaches and this place lacks a decent clean beach. Sure, you can wade out through the seaweed and muck - but that's not paradise to me.The hotel is good however if you want to use the game room or any facilities you must pay extra. So I guess one should examine this stay as if they weren't using those facilities unless they want to pay the extra $30 pp charge (I think that's what it was when we visited).Also the front desk staff is at most unhelpful. When they gave us a broken bed upon check-in, we changed rooms. However, they claimed all they had were twin beds (we had ordered a King originally). However, if we wanted to pay more, they could *find* another room with a King Bed. Lucky us.Pros+ close to convenience stores and local restaurants+ enormous breakfast spread that is quite good+ On the outside it looks like the property is really nice and it feels like that+ nice pool scene with lots of places to choose from+ super big chessboard for those of you into the millenia-old gameCons- there is a restaurant close by called Warung (can't remember the second part of the name but it serves Balinese Cuisine). The food was awful and we got sick. I wouldn't recommend anyone to try it. The Italian restaurant right across the street is really good though under-patronized.- Charging Extra for Use of Facilities- Lack of a good beach (check out Kuta; we didn't goto Nusa Dua but that costs extra if you're not staying there since it appears to be private)- Not on Nusa Dua- The staff trying to charge us more for what we pre-paid for...Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless management changes. It is frequented by many Asian travelers and is a very popular hotel however. I would even have given it 4 stars except for the issues we had.Tip: IF you want to go anywhere on the island (including the airport) go right outside and get your own taxi. It will be expensive enough without paying 3x for the hotel to do this for you. Most Balinese use US dollars and accept them. Otherwise, the exchange rate can be 8,900-9,500 of the Balinese currency to one dollar. For 120,000 we went from Kuta - Tanjung Benoa (Grand Mirage) - Airport which was a pretty good deal considering that most airport fixed-rate taxis will charge you over $10 for just one way to the airport. And Kuta is past the airport so we got in twice the miles for less.

<Content>Flawless stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on transit to australia. This place is amazing, thats all i can say. We managed to get sea facing deluxe room for 35 pounds a night including breakfast. Room was immaculate, my only gripe was that it was a bit damp at night. The Balinese staff we're the most genuinely friendly people I have ever come across, front the receptionist to the cleaner, always say hi, smiling, 7* service.Breakfast contained a huge variety of food, even chicken nuggets on one morning!!The beach, pool and gardens were spotless, the sea wasnt great for swimming but that was no bother as the pool was great. I recommend the water aerobics in the morning!!In the evenings we chose the themed buffets, first night tex-mex and the 2nd was mongolian, and the best thing about this one was you could have your own mie goreng made infront of your eyes with your choice of meat, veg and spices!Didn't get round to venturing outside so i can't comment on the rest of the resort. Same goes for the spa, didn't get round to checking it out.I do recommend getting a massage in the hut near the pool, was around 5pound for 1hrs full body massage.I could write an essay on this hotel and its high standards, warm welcome and great service, but i would be here all day! Would go back no hesitation. Loved it!

<Content>Nice hotel I stayed at this hotel with my wife for 2 weeks. Almost everything was excellent. The room was clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful. There was a fantastic artificial waterfall in the center of the hotel and the garden looked really luxuruous. Restaurants in the hotel were somewhat expensive but there were plenty of along the Tanjong Benoa mainroad where the meals were magnificent and very cheap, even the seafood. I would say the Grand Mirage' beach is the best if compared with the neighbour hotels - very wide and clean, although lots of seaweed in the water. Take care if you take parasailing - the staff failed to fix the parachute in a proper way and I fell into the boat passing below from about 2 meters high, a sort of additional adrenalin splash. I recommend to take a local guide with a car and travel across the island, many places are worth seeing, this pleasure costs some 35-40$ per day, petrol included. Unforgettable journey!

<Content>Grand Hotel in a good location The Grand Mirage is not in Nusa Dua but in Tanjung Benoa which is a more user friendly location. Nusa has lot of quality hotels but little in the way of outside food and shopping, Benoa on the other hand has many restaurants and some markets. It is a very under rated part of Bali.We found the standard of hotels in this area to be on par with Nusa Dua but you had options of picking where you wanted to eat or go. Do not bother eating at the hotel (other than breakfast which was very good) as there are many choices on the street at very good prices.Hotel is clearly dated but has been kept in good condition with lovely grounds and pool areas. Staff are very freindly and helpful.The hotel provided activities for those who are interested or you could laze by the beach and do nothing.We will definately return to this part of Bali as it offers more at better prices than Nusa Dua.

<Content>Lovely Stayed here with my wife in May 2001. In a beautiful location and away from the hustle and bustle of the larger towns. Hotel is situated on the beachfront with many small open air restaurants at the rear. There are a cluster of hotels (incl. wellknown chains) a few hundred yards down the road. Nice shopping centre and more restaurants there. Bali is beautiful and the people are friendly. Hope to go back in the future.

<Content>Beautiful ambience My wife and I have stayed at the Grande for 7 times now, and it is now our second home. We were looking for somewhere away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta, of 5-star standard but without the stuffiness you sometimes find in expensive hotels.We weren't disappointed. It's the staff that make the Grande. They are super-helpful and friendly, even by Bali standards.We make new guest friends there every time; the atmosphere is so welcoming and friendly.Also, the food and accommodation are very good, and you have plenty of other local restaurants to choose from if you like.The pool area is huge and scenic, and the hotel design very unusual, especially when viewed from out to sea. The 4-storey waterfall and pool at the entrance is just another touch of class. The Grande is definitely our overseas holiday favourite.

<Content>Excellence in Bali Spent 12 nights at this hotel in March 2007 and was delighted.The staff were exceptional, the food was good as was the service. The hotel was clean, the gardens were well kept as was the beach area. Recommend you try the beach side massage at the hotel and use the spa facilities if you can afford to.Spectacular countryside, so much to do on Bali that we couldn't cram it all in. We went white water rafting (I fell out), rode on elephants, took a ride up to the volcanoes amongst other things. The hotel can arrange a taxi or speak to Budda who works at the swim up bar, his brother drives a taxi, very reasonable rates and he speaks very good english. He will take you anywhere you want to go.Make sure you barter in all shops except supermarkets, where you will probably find the cheapest prices anyway.Everybody was so friendly, they are trying desperately to increase the tourist levels, the hotel was only 51% occupied whilst we were there.Another tip: make sure you follow their customs in respect of dress at temples etc and you will be treated with even greater respect.I want to go back!

<Content>Wonderful Family Experience Hi - we just returned from the Grand Mirage Resort in Bali. It was an excellent choice for my family of five (children aged 8, 6  5). We purchased the all-inclusive package, which was very convenient to our situation. The all-inclusive package included transfers, food, drinks, lodging, gamesroom, internet, non-motor watersports, tennis, etc. and time-limited activities like jet-skiing, ocean snorkelling, massages, etc. The service was excellent - everyone likes to smile. The first night I arrived, I asked for an extra bed and within minutes they brought one free of charge for the week. The room was big, but was slightly dark and musty. We didn't mind as we really only slept there. I would recommend upgrading to an Ocean View though. The food in the main restaurant was good - lots to choose from in the buffet. The oceanfront grill was magnificent as was the Italian restaurant inside.The swimming pool is excellent - it's like 3 big pools in one and was never crowded. The ocean was good as well, but unswimmable after 3pm as the tide goes out. Get your chairs early as everyone throws a towel on them in order to reserve them. There are a few locals who enter the beach area and try to sell tours and knick-knacks, but they are not aggressive like the ones in Kuta. Lots of security guards around but never a distraction.There are shows every other night, which were good and entertaining. No noise at all - we never had any problems and everyone slept extremely well. Across the street from the hotel, there are restaurants and shops that are pretty decent. Expect attention from taxi drivers and shop/restaurant owners. I especially recommend one little jewellery shop across from the hotel that specializes in silver. We bought three beautiful silver necklaces with exquisite pendants for US $110.The hotel is an excellent choice. It's not a gold and diamonds hotel mind you - you won't find the rich and famous here, but that's exactly why I liked it.All the best...

<Content>Great Hotel for Honeymoon The Grand Mirage Resort is ideal for a Balinese honeymoon. We stayed at the resort for 10 days in February 2007. Upon arrival we booked the Cinnamon cloud spa treatment for couples at Thalasso Bali. It was romantic, relaxing and an ideal way to recover from our jetlag.The beach and pool facilities are well cared for and the atmosphere is very relaxing. Also, the ocean and pool water were very warm. There were usually nice places to sit, despite all of the beach towel place holders. The Balinese massages on the beach were one of our favorite things about the hotel. HINT: If you buy 5 massages in advance one is free. We would highly recommend the massages! My wife and I also enjoyed the American breakfast each morning near the pool. The hotel also served continental and Chinese alternatives if you feel eggs, waffles and bacon are too heavy for breakfast. Because the breakfast was so filling we often skipped lunch and then ate dinner outside the hotel. By far our favorite restaurant was Bumbu Bali. It is in walking distance from the hotel (7-10 minutes). The restaurant has cultural performances on certain nights, but book in advance. Most restaurants will send a car to the Grand Mirage to taxi you back and forth at no additional charge. Looking for (Oleh-Oleh) souvenirs? There is two-story convenience store about a 7 minute walk from the Grand Mirage. There is no haggling and prices are clearly marked. We found that the wood carvings are comparable and much cheaper than those at workshops visited on the tourist excursions. We hope you enjoy your stay in paradise.

<Content>Beautiful place, beautiful people If you want a relaxing holiday in beautiful surroundings then this is the place for you.The staff and people are so friendly here you can't help being put at ease and relaxing. The hotel is right on the beach front in a beautiful location and also has a lovely swimming pool area. There are plenty of sunloungers owned by the hotel both on the beach and at the pool -they even put quilted mats on the loungers to make them more comfortable.There is some entertainment on at the hotel if you want to be involved including pool volleyball, cookery demonstrations and local acts on each night in the lounge bar. The hotel also put on special gala evenings too at an extra cost.The hotel is beautifully kept and the plentiful staff are always cleaning the hotel and pruning the gardens.Every member of staff you pass is so pleasant and polite be it a cleaner, gardener or entertainment staff and will always enchange greetings with you. The hotel is actually situtuated in Tanjung Benoa and not Nusa Dua as most literature suggests. This resort is much smaller and does not have much bar life although there are plenty of restaurants outside the hotel and the hotel bar provides nightly enterainment. It is much cheaper to eat outside the hotel and safe to do so. The hotel food is very nice but you will only have to pay about a third of the price to eat outside the hotel. Similarly it is much cheaper to buy souvenirs outside the hotel, be prepared to barter as on average you will only have to pay two thirds of the original price suggested. This is a wonderful hotel and the people there truly deserve your custom - I would definatley go here again.
