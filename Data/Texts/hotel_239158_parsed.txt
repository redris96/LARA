<Content>Ronda Hotel Barcelona is a great deal for visiting a city Ronda Hotel Barcelona room number 305It is really a great deal. I can麓t understand what others expect from a 3 star hotel, because some visitors wrote bad critics of this hotel.Perhaps they had another room or they expect more than the price could offer.The hotel is situated near the center, 10 minutes to walk to the ramblas, 3 minutes go walk to the next metro station, surrounded by coffe shops. What else do you need for visiting a city?The reception was opened for 24 hours, very helpfull and friendly of corse english speaking. I booked by one RatesToGo.com but it would be a little cheaper to book it directly. They have rooms with double bed and french beds. Just tell them, what you prefer. If you book by RatesToGo, your credit card is only charged for about 20% of the rate. If you book directly it would be charged for the full rate.When you arrive you have to pay for the whole.I payed 鈧?56 for a double per day without breakfast.The breakfast is a buffet for about 鈧?10. I didn麓t need it, because dinnertime in spain starts after 9 pm. What to do with a buffet in the morning? Allthough it looked good.my room? I had everything I needed. Two clean beds, safe to rent, Tv with international channels (in german only 3 sat) clean bathroom with toilet, bidet and bathtube. Every day fresh towels.Hairdryer - soap and shampoo renewed every day.At our arrival, a lamp was not working, but it was renewed after some minutes.I had a room looking not to the street. Perhaps this is the reason why we didn麓t have any noise of the street. Somethimes I heared the elevator, when the wondow was opened. They have also climatronic or heating, but I didn麓t use it in november.I was very lucky with this hotel. It is a great deal for this money and a great deal to visit barcelona.

<Content>WARNING! DO NOT STAY HERE. The first night we returned to the hotel after dinner to find the doors locked and no-one at reception, despite 24 hour reception service advertised on website. We banged on the doors but no answer. A man then attacked us, stole our phones, bank cards etc. Screamed for help, some time later the receptionist finally appeared and doors opened. She claims she was up checking rooms. We pointed out that this is not 24 hour reception service, she was on the defensive - despite us being distraught by the event she offered us no help, no concern for our wellbeing. We informed her we wouldn't be staying any longer - were checking out the following morning. Asked for refund when we were checking out the following morning - the receptionist absolutely refused, and then presented us with a phone bill for 70Euro for the emergency calls made home from reception to cancel phones/bank cards. They ended up calling police because we said we weren't happy paying it until a refund on our rooms was sorted! Booked an early flight home, stayed at nicer safer hotel the next two nights (Hotel Jazz - definitely reccommend it). Awful trip, terrible service, disaster of a hotel - DO NOT GO THERE. Really really unsafe area. Two dark alleys on either side of the hotel - perfect get aways for thieves.

<Content>Stay away from this hotel We arrived at the Hotel Ronda and was met by a very rude receptionist. We felt like we were her last priority between current guests, phone conversations and everything else. Our room reeked of sewer, and we could hear the elevator every time it moved. The bathroom was full of mold and very cramped. I talked to the receptionist 10 minutes after checking in and she was very defensive. She said I could look at another room. It was the same room, one story below, and it smelled even worse (this was their only other available room). I kindly asked for a refund so that we could go somewhere else, but she refused (saying that she had talked to the manager about it, who was not working that Sunday). We decided to rough it out, and stayed there for the two nights. I also talked to hotels.com, and they contacted the hotel but the manager at the hotel was not willing to give a refund. Location is OK, but not the greatest. It's on a busy street with lots of sirens throughout the night. The standard of this hotel is very close to that of a hostel. Do yourself a huge favor and stay away from this place.

<Content>3 stars? More like Brown Star. Location - terrible, right in the centre of a seedy rough neighbourhood. Room - terrible, tiny, cramped, beds about 4 inches off the floor, bathroom full of mould, automatic shutters on windows add to the prison cell feel. For some reason you are not provided with a remote control for the TV unless you ask for one at reception. All night long you will hear random conversations, shouting, doors slamming, running in the corridors, etc. This hotel is the most excellent conductor of sound I have experienced. This hotels status as a 3 star makes a mockery of the ratings system on the continent. A 1 star rating would be more than this dump deserves. Awful, awful hotel, which by the way was booked through the Barcelona tourist information office which I find amazing. Of all the hotels available in the city why does the tourist office choose to send visitors to a kip in a rough area of town? Nonsensical. Avoid at all costs, as it will only ruin your stay in what is otherwise a beautiful city

<Content>Worked for a mother/daughter trip We arrived in Barcelona without hotel reservations. The local tourist info booth booked this for us. Price was right. Hotel sheets/bathroom were clean. The water pipes are a bit loud and sound carries through them. Small balcony (no chairs/table) with good quality door/windows to shut out the loud noises from the plaza down below.

<Content>Good enough We booked this hotel last minute (directly, as it was cheaper) for its price and location. The receptionists werent particularly friendly, but the room was clean and air conditioned and the location had character. Though it did feel unsafe at times, there were plenty of people about until the early hours of the morning (we were there during the Aug peak season). I would definitely come here again at that price (or less).

<Content>Better than we expected. I had previously booked a hotel in the Gothic area for a one night stay, and our dates changed, so I had to ring Expedia to select another hotel and cancel the other one.I booked this one solely on price, as we'd managed to get a 76E deal on the other hotel, but this one was 80E, and we didn't really want to pay any more.Once it was then booked I then read the reviews and was very worried, as they didn't rate it well. So I was surprised when we arrived, with the help of our Tomtom on our motorbike.Firstly they have parking, at the cost of 18 euros a night, which for the city centre isn't bad, but we parked our bike around the corner, in a little plaza, which was perfectly safe and not tampered with. The room was very clean and quite quirky - with a slightly slanted ceiling. The twin beds were large ( we tend to usually go for twin beds now as doubles in hotels are sometimes really small!).The bath was the small spanish variety, but a little hard to get into if you have problems stepping in and out as it backed onto the toilet - but I expect they would have let us change rooms if this had been an issue.The area itself wasn't the best in the world, but I did know this when I booked it. But it is only a 5 minute walk to the Ramblas, and if you go straight across to it, rathe than down and aross then you avoid the smellier areas - only one street we went down smelt like a toilet.All in all it wasn't as bad as I expected from other reviews....I would stay there again, I have stayed in better locations but for us the price was right that night.

<Content>Give this place a chance! Hmmm, to say I was a little petrified about staying here given the previous discomfiting reviews is to put it mildly to say the least. We got a verrry cheap deal through Lastminute for a 3 night breack with BA flights where, if you consider each leg of the journey cost 拢100 each we essentially got the hotel for free. Seeing as there was no such thing as a free meal, I was expecting a dirty hell hole and very rude staff and can happily report I was proven wrong. The staff was curteous and gave us maps of the area upon check in. We took the stairs to room 110 and found it to have adequate space and was spotlessly clean. Toiletries, fluffy towels (changed every day), even combs were provided. If you want extra, such as the safe or a remote control for the tv, these can be hired. The airconditioning worked well and the beds were fine. You could hear the toilet being flushed in the room above, but only in the bathroom and we had some noisy Czechs in the room adjacent to us so this hotel, as any others can be noisy at times. Bring earplugs or sleeping pills if this bothers you.As noted in other reviews, the hotel is very well placed. Head up the road to Universitat, a short stroll with many good places to eat, a bit further in the same direction is Eixample, the gay district. To the east is La Rambla, you come emerge onto it about a third the way down which is fine.For those that are planning their first trip, try getting the train from the airport rather than a taxi. At the airport buy from the ticket machines a T10 for zone 1 costing approx 鈧? (this is pretty much all of Barcelona that you would possibly need!) the T10 is a carnet of 10 single trips which can be used on the trains, metro, buses. Get on either train departing from the airport - they both go to the center. Change at Passeig de Gracia, a stop after Sants, and hop onto the metro to Sant Antoni stop. You will then be about a 4 minute walk from the hotel and the entire journey would have cost you about 鈧?.40. Bargain! Also, I didn't try the hotel 鈧?0 bargain as there are many many coffee shops on Carrer Sant Antoni where you can get a croissant or sandwich and a coffee for about 鈧?.Enjoy Barcelona, it's a wonderful city.

<Content>fab location, good hotel After reading some of the reviews, we were a little concerned that the area of this hotel may be a bit dodgy. however, we took our chances and booked a 5 night holiday with Hotel Ronda. Fortunately, we saw no signs of anything seedy or dangerous anywhere near the hotel, which is literally a 10 min walk from Las Ramblas and 2 mins from a tube station. The hotel room was modern and clean. At times we were aware that the walls were quite thin as when guests in the next room used the shower it was very obvious, however, generally we slept well and had no complaints. The location is ideal for commuting around. Nearby square of plaza des angels is worth a visit and plaza reil is within walking distance. recommended for lower budget holidays and location.

<Content>Canny I thought this was place was canny enough, clean, staff were friendly and a handy enough walk from Place de Catalunya and La Rambla.Stay to the main drag which is easily navigable if you're easily spooked as some of the back streets are a little ropey but in saying that we experienced nothing too daunting.The room itself was basic but clean and fairly quiet, we were on the 5th floor and the only noise we had was related to toilet activity from next door and above. We must have timed our visit along with the national pop drinking competitions as there were some champion efforts in the wee hours!!!I would recommend this, not for romantic weekends but alright if you're looking for a room where you'll spend little time but want good value for money.I found the staff spot on, it appeared a lot of the staff were Philipino and they were grand at all times.Breakfast for 10 euros. We had this on a couple of mornings in the same way an army going on a yomp would have porridge. It may not be a culinary delight but it does it's job!

<Content>Not Again Foolishly I didnt read the reviews until after we had booked the holiday. When I did I was dreading the hotel which was said by some reviewers to be in a red light area with working girls in the local square.I'm glad to say that we saw no sign of them at all and the cafe (Bracafe - nothing to do with the girls but short for Brazilian apparently) was often full of local cops on a break when we went in late at night.My partner and I have been to Barcelona before but did not know this area. The hotel is definitely a 10 minute walk from the Ramblas - but a reasonably interesting one. However, I would have preferred to be closer to the Bari Gotic area.The back streets round about are a bit seedy in places but it looks as if they are working on bringing the area up. My partner and I didnt feel threatened when walking about.The room was spartan but had all the basic needs though the foam rubber mattress was a bit slidey.There seemed to be a variety of people of all ages staying there but a lot of young American tourist groups in particular.It was very noisy at night at all hours and at times we were kept awake. Somehow the building seemed to echo more than the average from floor to floor and it was excrutiating when a woman in a nearby room took over 1/2 an hour to get her card key into the lock at 3 a.m. one night.The reception staff were very indifferent to residents and did not seem to care who came and went which did not inspire confidence.Neither of us would want to stay there again.

<Content>Nice no-frills hotel in a fantastic location Central location, walk two blocks to University Metro stop and you can go just about anywhere. Just off of a busy street, but tucked back onto a quiet side street. Some reviewers complained of noise -- ask for an upper room toward the back of the hotel if you're a light sleeper. Our 6th floor room was quiet as a church. 24 hour front desk support. Wireless internet for a very reasonable fee. Clean room, comfortable beds. Requested change of sheets after 3 days, else housekeeping was superb. Didn't try the restaurant.

<Content>Hotel Rwanda Indeed This 'hotel' is quite possibly the most terrible I have ever stayed in. Unfortunately we were in Barcelona during an international mobile phone conference which left us with little choice according to our budget. We paid 90 euro p.n. (without breakfast) and as this is classed a 3 star hotel, I assumed it would be ok. It most certainly was not. We were given room 306 which must be the noisiest in the hotel - terrible. Beds were foam and even thought you may request a non-smoking room don't count on it. Bathroom was mouldy and room was damn hot - even in the middle of winter. There was no bar fridge nor glasses. To top it all off, we had to pay a 20 euro deposit for the TV remote control. When I questioned this the receptionist told me this was normal. I thought this must be some sort of spanish tradition - we are now staying in a lovely 3 star hotel in Girona and I can assure you this is not the practice of all spansih hospitality institutions. This is the first review I have written as I feel that others need to be warned. DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS DESPERATE. The only compliment I can offer is that the receptionists spoke English and we were allowed to check in early , a small blessing.

<Content>HOTEL RWANDA!!! My friend and i stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in july 07.ok lets begin with its Location:: this hotels location was pretty good in regards distance to las ramblas with a ten to fifteen minute walk. HOWEVER the square adjacent to the hotel was a gathering point for the LOCALS who seem to use the STREET as a public toilet facility!!!!!!on the upside to this location there was a SPAR around the corner which was open 24 hours which was always a good thing.now lets turn to the ROOM!! it was very basic- bed bathroom and shower and smal table with small mirror.bathroom steamed up that much after a shower, i nearly lost my friend in it a couple of times.a tip for the hotel would be to install a fan!! room didnt feel very secure as there was no lock on the door and anybody could access the room at any time! but i suppose its true u get what u pay for if ure looking for cheap stay with good location, this measures up okay.oh and before i forget,the outside of the hotel is a bit offputting as it is completely under reconstruction with scaffolding covering most of the hotel.but if your looking for somewhere that you arent planning on spending much time in, its fine. but luxury is left at the door when you enter this place,ps. NO evidence of a mini bar and the beds are from the stone age

<Content>OK Took us a little time to find as this hotel is off the main St Anthony Road but after we found it, hotel in general was OK. Our room was clean and tidy, we were on 6th Floor, and really have only one moan about our room - the bed was like sleeping on a brick. We complained, but nothing was done but we were only there for a long weekend so it wasn't so bad I suppose.The breakfast was good (continental) and the staff were generally friendly and helpful.BUT........my major complaint was about our car. We hired one at the airport and when we arrived in Barcelona we decided to abandon it for the weekend as the underground is excellant etc.As there was no place to park around our hotel, we had to use the hotel car park for 3 nights and were astonished to find that their 18 euro per night charge, also applied to residents !!!We gave them a mouthful on departure, I can tell you and told them it wasn't on but they were adamant that we had to pay 54 Euros. We weren't impressed. But, if we go back again to Barcelona, which we will 'cos the city is great, we wouldn't take a car anyway 'cos it really is unnecessary - so don't you take one either !!

<Content>Good for a cheap stay Ok, the Ronda Hotel. I will say it is probably one of the poorer quality hotels I have stayed in, but I have been quite lucky for the majority of the time. I was travelling with my girlfriend and a mate and we were looking for a cheap night in Barcelona as our plane arrived late.The man at the check out was not in the best of moods and didn't know a word of English, luckily someone was there to help him, though I couldn't understand him he seemed in an extremely grumpy mood. We luckily had a room on the very top floor and it was situated so noise from other rooms wasn't a problem. In the morning some repair men were around and some noise was heard at around 6 am, but apart from that we heard nothing.Not to ramble on, the hotel is in a poorer part of Barcelona, while it is central the surroundings didn't feel as safe the room was clean, very basic but at 51 euro for the night for 3 of us (on last minute.com), we weren't expecting much and was great for what we needed it for. A cheap bed the first night before we caught the train down the coast. We were in Barcelona a few days later at the Catalonia Albinoni, a bit more expensive but a fifty times better hotel refer to review, the service desk there said if your facing the sea, try and stay on the left side of Las Ramblas and from what we witnessed this is true.I woudln't recommend this hotel for people looking for a nice hotel but a cheap stay with clean rooms its fine.Breakfast, we paid 10 euro p.p and it was quite ordinary.

We could hear the people in the room next door and above, people coming in late at night, people leaving early in the morning and people in the bar...all from our second floor room. The beds were very hard and squeaky. We asked to be moved after one night. The room was also small, dark and not not very appealing. ...and having to pay a 拢20 deposit for a TV remote control??? What sort of people steal remote TV remotes controls?On the plus side, the breakfast was good and the staff were polite. Though overall I did feel 拢108 per night was a rip off.

<Content>A pleasant surpirse A week before I was due to travel to the Ronda Hotel for a three day stay I decided to read a few reviews of the hotel and was horrified to see how bad some of them were. In fact, I even tried to cancel the booking and look for alternative accommodation - how glad am I that I didn't! The hotel is in an ideal location for exploring the city. The Aerobus from the airport stops in the Placa de Catalonia and the hotel is about a 10 minute walk away. All of the streets around the hotel lead to La Ramblas and offer a good range of bars and cafes for you to choose from for meals, drinks and tapas. The rooms in the hotel were clean and well furnished and each room has it's own hiardryer, tv and safe as well as comfy beds and a clean well presented bathroom. Granted the view from the room wasn't picturesque but on a city break how many people choose to spend a great deal of time in their room - there is far too much to see in the city for that! The breakfast served in the hotel was great with a good choice of items. The bar area is nicely decorated and drinks were reasonable. As for the supposed prostitutes that other people say hang around in the nearby areas, I didn't see any! I don't normally write things like this but I felt that I should to put the record straight - we would definitely visit Barcelona again and would have no hesitation in staying in the Ronda. It's a great base for a short break and I recommend that anybody who has read other reviews and is worried should visit the place and see for themselves!!

<Content>ronda is ok! Having read some of the negative reviews about this hotel on this site, I wondered what I had let myself in for. However I need not have worried. Stayed here for 8 nights, and had a fab time.The Ronda is well situated, with public transport on your doorstep.We stayed in room 415, and although a bit small, it was adequate, with facilities like TV, minibar, phone, etc.Rooms were cleaned every day, and really you could not fault the cleanliness. Complimentary toiletries too. Breakfast is a self service buffet for 6 euro p.p. Was not that impressed, but judge for yourselves. However we found the Tapas Bar on the square excellent, an alternative if you just want coffeepastries..The Ronda is fine, I cannot believe it's been slagged off so much. Judge it for yourself, rather than reading negative reviews, half of which I believe to be well exaggerated, having seen it in the flesh so to speak. So make up your own mind, I'm glad that I did.I

<Content>Adequate for the price Booked through the internet based purely on central location and availablity. Then saw some reviews on this site  was a bit worried. However, when we found the hotel (its a little hidden in the back streets) we were met with an efficient reception and checked into our tripple room which was clean  not too small. The bathroom was clean  functional.The location is 10 minutes from the Ramblas and 5 from the Placa Universidad. There were some ladies of the night nearby but they did not accost people and the local bars were busy  friendly.Overall I would suggest if you are looking for cheap accommodation for a limited number of nights the Ronda is fine. If you want a more luxurious weekend away, then pay more  stay somewhere else.

<Content>Central-ish location, not value for money. This was a family weekend break, 3 nights. First problem was our Taxi driver struggled to find the hotel. Reception staff were friendly and helpful but they wanted full payment at start of stay, this was a first for us and left us feeling concerned, but it was too late to backout. Rooms varied in size with different levels of fittings and different levels of repair. We swapped with one of our sons as our original room had 3ft of hanging space and no shelves, he used the spare bed for his suitcase and clothes. The rooms were dark with little natural light as they surrounded a small 'courtyard' overlooking other rooms. Beds were uncomfortable but linen and towels were Ok. Bathrooms were Ok, a little on the small side, some mould, and the floor got wet from the shower, they were kept clean. Breakfast which was extra was basic continental. Hotel is close to Metro and we did walk into city centre each evening. However the surrounding area is a little seedy with prostitues on the streets. Not a 3 star hotel, not value for money, we will not go back.

<Content>Good location with transport links Having read the reviews, I was a little worried about what to expect when I got there especially as I had a young child with me. My fears were unfounded. The hotel was clean and was located very close to the metro staions and walking distance to La Ramblas and Placa Catlunya. An added bonus was that the Aerobus dropped off at Placa Universitat, about 10minutes walking distance from the hotel.I agree that for a three star hotel, the rooms were a little small but I have seen worse. The reception staff although polite could have been a bit more customer focussed. Again, I have expericienced worse in my travels. The staff at breakfast were very friendly.The rooms were cleaned on a regular bais and I had absolutely no complaints. The beds were comfortable and after walking a lot in barcelona, it was great to come back to a hot shower and we slept like logs.Although there were ladies of the night in the square, they were not in your face and were interacting with the locals. I was dreading this initially but I can honestly say that if I had not known about them, I would have not noticed.Breakfast set us up for the day and with a 5 year old, there was enough variety to get him to eat satisfactorily. I agree that down the road you could have had something similar for less but you would have to go looking.....On the whole I was pleasantly suprised and would go back to the same hotel. It was within our budget and it did not disappoint.Don't be swayed by all the negative reviews. I am not one for writing reviews but I thought it was necessary to address the balance!

<Content>Terrible reviews but don't panic too much...this is the truth... Booked through lastminute after reading some OK reviews on the Internet. After booking we read some TERRIBLE reviews and panicked big time!!! We were expecting the worst and thought we would end up finding a different hotel when we arrived so when we got there we were quite releaved. Can't think how it has made its 3 stars - we would say more of a 2 star. The hotel is right in the middle of the red light district -between 20 - 30 prostitutes right outside morning, noon and night with plenty of dodgy characters to boot BUT they keep themselves COMPLETETY to themselves and we were probably over parinoid about safety because of the other reviews we had read. Having said that there were spanish families sitting out at night with the prostitutes - it's just a different way of life. Never saw any prostitutes in the Hotel as some reviews indicated so i don't believe for a minute that they use it as their base. People were there with their families and if i had a child i would take mine there tomorrow. We were expecting the room to be filthy but it was more dingy than filthy and i am a clean freak!!! The window looked out to a wall 6ft away, the bathroom had some mould and their were cigarette burns all over the toilet seat. The beds were not very comfy but in the heat we had and after so much walking i would have slept on a washing line. Another worry was the noise level. Yes it is quite a noisey place - not because the walls are thin but because of the aircon vents. I am a light sleeper and i managed fine and we were there in peak season so i would'nt go buying any ear plugs - i suppose it is luck of the draw who is there when you are.A bonus was the aircon worked brilliant, but then the room never got any sunlight anyhow. The receptionists were extrememly polite and helpful. The ben linen was clean and fresh each day as were the towels. Location is at least 5 mins from las rambles so you are quite central. If you have booked this hotel don't panic just go expecting a 2 star hotel and hope that there are no noisy stag or hen parties booked in at the same time as you!!!

<Content>Come On ?!!! Hosing the streets at one! ---- in the street! Graffiti!...Outrage, I tell you absolute outrage... etc, etc. Honestly, Barcelona can be a bit of a hole; and it's all the more charming for it. If you're bothered about people waking you up at three, when they get in, maybe you should stay out 'til four. If you're bothered about smells and views then don't stay here, pay a bit more money and go somewhere better you skinflints. If you just want somewhere to leave your stuff and sleep a bit during the day (they call it a 'fiesta', apparently) then save your pennies and push that button! Hoorah! some truth! By the way I'm going back soon, can anyone suggest anywhere better please?

<Content>Central location, not bad It took us a while to initially find the road, let alone the hotel, with no help whatsoever from the locals, who had no idea either.When we left the hotel the next morning and wondered around we realised that we weren't actually in that bad a location for amenities with Les Rambles, Placa de Catalunya and several metro stations within a short walk.Rooms are basic as is the breakfast offered but no more than expected for the price

<Content>The most hideous, awful and noisy hotel...Ever! Stayed here in October 2005 and although the cental location is good, everything else about this place is disgusting. The room was so small, you could barely squeeze past the end of the bed and there was not even enough space to put our suitcase anywhere. The bed, although resonably comfortable, was battered as was the rest of the furniture. The carpet was badly stained and ripped up in places and don't even get me started on the bathroom.....absolutely disgusting. The window in the bedroom overlooked what I suppose was some kind of courtyard, but it can't have been more that 15 square foot and every side was surrounded by rooms. So basically straight outside your window were more rooms, above, below, left, right, overlooking, you name it. Now I can slum it when I have to, but what really made this place so vile, was the noise. Full blown shouting, people running up and down the corridoors screaming, all night, every night, till 3 in the morning is not nice for anyone. Sleeping was limited to 4 or 5 hours a night and you were always on edge that someone was going to come bursting through your door. I can't express stongly enough my feelings for this place as staying here really spoiled our 3 night break in Barcelona. Don't do it to yourselves!!

<Content>An okay Hotel Booked the Ronda in a hurry before reading reviews, were concerned about them but found the hotel to be ideally situated for all the sights. The hotel and rooms were clean and acceptable, breakfast was fine, staff very helpfull. Area arround hotel did have a few call girls but no problem at all. The hotel was a little noisy at night but no worse than any other city centre hotel.Hotel Ronda may not be quite worthy of 3-stars and worth 拢50- a night but was an okay place to stay.we would go back there.

<Content>This hotel should be on (---) - BAD Well the photos on the web look great!, rooms looked nice... air conditioning, tv, bath... Well I think they employed a good photo tech to adjust the photos slightly...When you walk into a hotel which you have to pay a deposit for the remote control you know your in a bad place... It wouldn't be so bad if it was around 20euro per night.... we wonder if they rent the rooms for the prostitutes per hour?? humm...Well don't get the remote as the rooms are so small you can almost reach the tv from the bed... You have a choice of 4 views... the inside of the building (air con), the roofs of broken down houses, and two sides where you can almost touch the other buildings...The bathrooms are terrible, toilet is so close to the wall you have to sit sideways, floor gets totally wet as the shower is naf... not to mention the mould on the walls... OK now I tried to give this a hotel a break, the beds were not to bad (to small) and it would make us see the city more... but I don't think they have walls, maybe wall paper... I think all the prostitutes running around the building with their high heals didn't help...I saw people coming and looking at around more rooms to change, with not a good look on their faces... all round I wouldn't stay here again if someone payed me!!!! Area is terrible, yes close to everything... but hey so is the subway...

<Content>Not as bad as the reviews! I was actually dreading staying in this hotel after reading the awful reviews. I even panicked a few days before heading off and looked around for other accomdation but my husband suggested we try it and make up our own mind. Now Im glad we did. Location is absolutely perfect - couldnt ask for better. The hotel itself is very clean and the continental breakfast is more than adequate. As for the noise, we stayed in room 216, I am couldnt complain about noise - afterall it is in the middle of one of the busiest cities in Europe so you are bound to hear noise at some stage. The 'Ladies of the night' are based in the square beside the hotel, but it is very harmless and amusing I thought.I am not one for writing reviews on websites, but I thought in this case because it got slated so much, I would write about our experience. If you have booked, believe me - it is not that bad!

<Content>Seedy location - awfully noisy Plus points: Good location, clean and reasonable breakfast.Minus points: Area full of prostitutes from around 2pm onwards - whilst not particulary threatening - still not very pleasant. Hotel is directly off a square that is frequented by locals and their children - lovely to see families together laughing and playing, but not so good when still incredibly noisy at 2 am! Rooms not sound proofed and we were situated at side with 'balcony' facing onto a building did not get 1 decent nights sleep out of 4. Cannot believe it is 3 star, would not stay there again.

<Content>hotel ronda The hotel itself is fine but the surrounding area is not good. The back streets around it have graffiti and it is obviously a low class area. We were advised not to use these streets as a short cut from The Ramblas after dark!On the main road which is full of electronic showrooms there were around 20 prostitutes in doorways - they did not approach us but they were highly visible.Hotel itself is on a corner. The laundry gets wheeled out at midnight (!) and the inside rooms are dark as there is only about 7 feet between the outside walls of the building. It is clean and considering the area quite quiet, unless you count the council workmen hosing down the nearby square at 1am!Breakfast was an average cold buffet, not as good as Campanile's!

<Content>OK - but could do better! This hotel was centrally situated - only a ten minute walk from Las Ramblas, and close to a metro station. However it is definitely in the 'seedier' part of the city with a large number of prostitutes hanging around nearby!! The hotel itself was clean and the staff all spoke good english, but the breakfast was basic (as has already been described) and the noise from in tthe hotel and outside was dreadful. We didn't get a full nights sleep because of it! For the money you could do better!

<Content>Much better than expected...! My boyfriend  I have just returned from Barcelona, having spent 3 nights in the Hotel Ronda, and I must say that the reviews of the hotel on this website are far too harsh.I booked the trip before looking on this website, so when I did read the bad reviews I was really worried about staying at the Ronda  wished I had booked somewhere else. Yet upon arriving at the hotel, I found it not at all as bad as previous reviews suggested.I personally found the Ronda to be a well-situated hotel (just 10 mins walk to Placa Catalunya  the Ramblas), with friendly staff  service. The breakfast was ok, neither me or my boyfriend had any complaints about it.As for the noise, the only night that there was some noise was on the second night when some loud Italians were shouting quite a bit at around 3am, but at the end of the day people are on holiday and are only having a good time! i'm sure when me  my boyfriend came home drunk on the first night we were probably noisy, too. if people are offended by noise then perhaps they shouldn't stay in a hotel in the middle of a huge and lively city like Barcelona... Overall, the Ronda was a clean, well-situated hotel that wasn't as noisy or as terrible as reviewers of this hotel claim. The beds were fine, the rooms were clean  I seriously don't understand why people have complained about the Ronda so much. I thouroughly enjoyed my stay there  my boyfriend  I are already planning a return trip to Barcelona and the Ronda!In my opinion, stay at the Hotel Ronda  form your own opinion, that's what I wish I had done instead of going there expecting a noisy hotel in a seedy area, as suggested by the reviews!

<Content>Very Noisy Doesn't matter how satisfactory the rooms are and how helpful the staff are if the noise is unbearable and unrelenting. We stayed here for four nights and didn't have one decent night sleep, we even considered cutting our losses and leaving the hotel after the second night. I would heavily discourage anyone using this hotel, pay a little more and get a hotel which allows sleep! Some drunk college students were banging on our door and running around the corridor until 5am. Some one was sick outside our room as well.

<Content>Very noisy hotel I just came back from a weekend in Barcelona, where I spent one night at the Ronda Hotel. The hotel is charmless, but clean, well-situated and has friendly, helpful staff, and the rooms are simple but adequate. However, the hotel is very poorly constructed and there is absolutely no sound proofing anywhere, and the noise between rooms was tremendous. I could understand the conversations of our neighbors as if they were in my room! There are no carpets in the halls or rooms, so the sound resonates all over. The toilets and showers also make a lot of noise between rooms and floors. Also, as this hotel is cheap, it tends to attract the younger, louder tourists. When I stayed there, it was full of loud, drunk college students who would shout and stamp up the stairs at 4am--it reminded me of a college dorm.There were many tourists who stayed out late, and then others who got up early, so there was never a quite moment to get some sleep. We were exhausted and grumpy after sleeping at the Ronda. Just for the noise, I would actively discourage anyone from staying at this hotel (unless noise doesn't bother you). The breakfast was pretty awful too, but no worse than in other hotels of this category (bad coffee, no fresh juice, canned fruit, white bread toast, cereal).

<Content>Basic but clean This hotel is basic, but clean, and good if you are on a budget. The breakfast leaves a lot to be desired but we were only there for two nights and had breakfast elsewhere on the 2nd morning. But for how long you spend in your hotel when you are exploring this beautiful city it is ideal.

<Content>Uncomfortable hotel This hotel is located down a dirty side street that stinks of birds and wee. Rooms over look a square which is a gathering place for tenagers, drunks and prostitutes, the noise goes on til the early hours. Beds very old and if you're not carefull you will slide of the wonky mattresses and we were bitten several times by some sort of bed bug.Hotel was generally clean apart from the beds and the staff were helpful. The breakfast (10 euros pp) was very basic, a bit of bread, cheese and ham, no eggs or anything you might normally expect from 3* hotel.As a seasoned traveller who has stayed in plenty of hotels I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Not the best... We booked this city break late so prices were soaring but we saw this hotel and it looked reasonable so we booked it for 3 nights. Unfortunatly i did not look on here before we booked, but i did look after. Some reviews good some not so good but i went thinking it should be ok.When we got there staff were friendly and it didn't look anything spectacular but it wasn't awful. As expected from hearing other reviews the room was small but adequate but the view out of the window was awful it did look like it was some sort of disused elevator shaft not nice at all!!! the room was darkand you had to have the light on at all times buton the other hand the bathroom was large and clean.The bed was hard but not un- sleepable ( if thats a word!) I did not sleep well AT ALL the walls are paper thin you could here people shouting and running up and down the stairs at 3 in the morning and even hear people talking in the next room not to mention other things! If i had the option to stay there again i would'nt as for saying it has a good location it was ok but not the best and i wouldn'nt recommend walking back late at night.In my opinion only stay there if you have to!!!!!

<Content>Good location, but very loud Hotel Ronda has a great location -- only a few minutes' walk from the Ramblas and a metro station. Initially I was worried about staying in El Raval because it has a rough reputation, but the Contemporary Art Museum has gentrified the area and it was full of trendy and cool bars and shops. However, the glass doors to our balcony were paper-thin, as were the walls, so I would not recommend this place for bad sleepers. It's hard to take siesta when there are kids outside screaming, Mira! Mira! Mira! Apart from that, our room/bathroom were big and clean, and the Hotel provides everything that a tourist needs.

<Content>Not a bad hotel Just come back from a 2 night stay there and to be honest, I didn't have any problems at all. The location is great and staff friendly. Yes it can be noisy outside and the walls are thin but nothing a pair of earplugs won't cure and you can always ask for a room away from the street. A good budget hotel and would definatly recommend.

I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good nights' rest!!nadya, Ireland

<Content>Looks slightly like a youth hostel! The hotel looks alot better on the website than when you actually get there, slightly reminiscent of youth hostels in France. The interior is rather dull and basic and the rooms are fairly similar (nice bathroon though!). The location is actually pretty depressing (although near enough to Ramblas), on the saturday night there were actually prostitutes out the square which the hotel overlooks! I paid on average 拢100 a night and would definately spend more in future, Hotel Ronda was clean, friendly and nice enough but I wouldn't go there again as it was clinical with a VERY depressing view!!

<Content>So noisy!!! walls are too thin!!! We decided to say at the Hotel Ronda becasue of its location and price. The rooms in the photos looked great and the location of the Hotel was fine (away from the main road). However the room we got was so small - but at least it was clean. Here is the worst bit - the beds were really lumy and the walls and doors were so thin we coud hear everybody on the other side. the facct that we were stuck in a hotel full of loud Itallians didn't help matters. I mean I had to sleep with earplugs in my ears. As for the breakfast well it's not very good. There was no choice, the coffee tasted like water and the bread was stale.Basically you get what you pay for but I would definitly not stay here again. And in case you thing I am old and that is why I am oning I am not I am only 22.So if you want to stay in a cheap Hotel in a good location stay here, however if you actually want to get some sleep then don't!!

<Content>clean and friendly hotel we found the hotel clean and the staff very friendly,although when we booked we were told that the hotel was on las ramblas we were disapointed to find that we were a good 15 minute walk away. The breakfast was really good and set us up until mid afternoon. If you are getting there on your own steam then catch the aerobus ouside the airport into barcelona centre [placa catalunya] which will cost you next to nothing compared to the price of a taxi [very expensive] and when you get off the bus there is a taxi rank next toyou then get a taxi to your hotel until you get your bearings. We would also adise you to purchase a bus turistic ticket which is a open top bus taking you around the main sights and you can get off and on the bus as often as you like. This will only cost you 16 euros for 1 day and 20 for 2 days.

<Content>Basic But Clean Hotel Ronda is a basic yet clean hotel. The rooms are on the small side but you do get what you pay for. The bathroom looked like new. The location is a little out of the way. You will struggle to find the hotel by car (it took us an hour and a half of driving round and in the end we found it on foot). If you do go by car you have to drive over the pavement by the Bracafe and turn right by the front of the hotel. This leads me to parking. You wont find any and there is a 18 euro per night charge to use the hotels underground car park.  Overall it is a friendly, clean hotel and if your just looking for somewhere cheap and cheerful its ok.
