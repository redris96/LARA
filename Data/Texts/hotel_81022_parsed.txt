<Content>Superb! A very pleasant surprise, after reading the reviews about small rooms. Get a king! The queens are small, but are good for one person. We had a king and it was perfect. The staff was very accommodating overall - Dulce and Jason are the best. Great location - walk to many great spots, and you are two short blocks from transit central. The restaurant (Ozumo) attached is excellent, and two doors down is Perry's, with many more great choices nearby. One sour note: We were there Xmas day, and there were no pastries available that morning except through the rather expensive room service continental breakfast ($15/person). Also, we found out after the fact that there was a list of dining options for that evening at the front desk which the weekend/holiday staff did not want to share - we got a shrug and a, Just go to North Beach and walk around - you'll find something open. Boo. But I will go back!

<Content>The Rooms are Too Small!! The hotel has beautiful views of the Bay, however the rooms are way too small. We had to give up the view and were moved to the Kimpton Argonaut @ the Wharf. The Argonaut was a much nicer hotel than the Habor Court. Kimpton was very gracious and understanding.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location I booked this hotel because of the location. It's on the waterfront, a block away from where I used to work, and I miss it. (Left SF 2 years ago). The rooms, while small, are nicely decorated. The bathroom was a decent size, and the shower had great water pressure. As a solo traveler, I didn't mind the small room, but I wasn't a fan of the courtyard view. There was a huge metal furnace-like box right outside the window next to my bed, with pipes running through the courtyard. Definitely the ugliest view I've had (I'm just sayin'.) I didn't expect a bay view since I paid via Hotwire (which the check-in lady made a note of out loud), but since the hotel wasn't that crowded, I thought maybe I'd at least get a street view. Once I was in my room, I didn't feel like pushing it. And really, it was fine. I was concerned that because it was a pet-friendly hotel, there'd be cleanliness problems, but there weren't. Everyone was very nice. The complimentary wine was great, and I liked grabbing a cup of the morning coffee they provide and heading out for a gorgeous walk along the waterfront. I would stay here again if it was just me, but I wouldn't bring my kids since it looks like they only have one-bed rooms.

<Content>Nice little hotel The Habor Court is a nice little hotel in a great location at the Embarcadero, about a block from the Ferry building and walking distance to just about anywhere in the Financial District which is convenient if you're in town for business.The hotel itself is immaculately clean, the downstairs lounge/libing room area is very nice decorated and even has a fireplace. Every morning there's free coffee and tea (nice touch) there. There's also free wine at 5pm and free milk and cookies starting at 9pm. This is a great thought and really a differentiator for the hotel. There's also free Wi-Fi connections in the rooms and downstairs.The rooms are small however with a call downstairs I was able to get upgraded to a bay view room (great view of the bridge and waterfront) that was bigger. Overall its a nice hotel and great for business travelers. Do not expect over the top luxury but rather a clean, well kept convenient place to stay

<Content>Small but clean We stayed in this hotel 4 nights. The room was very small but clean. All the people that worked in the hotel were very pleasant. The down side was that aside from the small room, there was limited space to put your clothes, the room was dark and we had an awful view. The upside was that the room was very clean, furniture updated and the staff was very nice. The lobby where they served complimentary wine at 5pm was very large. They also served cookies and milk in the evening. We were able to use the gym for free at the YMCA next door.We ate at the 1930 Shanghai restaurant a few doors down and had excellent food. We also went to the outdoor Flea Market down the street on Saturday. Lot's of crafty items for sale.We would stay there again because the staff was so accommodating and the place was clean and the location was great.

<Content>Not for everyone, but worked for me... The location can't be better as it's right across the street from the Ferry Building--great for picking up snacks for the room. There are also several restaurants within a block (even on the same block!) that are very good and do to-go orders.The room was small, like others have said, but we thought it was about normal for San Francisco. We signed up for the Kimpton loyalty program ahead of time and they had a box of homemade trail mix and waters waiting for us in the room.Service was excellent. They serve milk and cookies at night--get there fast before the kids scarf them up! It was insane--I waited for an elderly couple to get their cookies and just as my hand was reaching the cookie plate three kids and a dad ran up and took nearly a DOZEN cookies (yes, the dad!) by reaching over and around me. That's jacked up. But not the fault of the hotel.If I had to do over again, I would definitely pay the extra $50 for the rooms with views. It would have been worth it--gorgeous view of the Bay Bridge.We paid for the parking package and were very glad we did. The staff are totally willing to run out and get your car, as well as give directions and recommendations.We checked out the YMCA facilities and were given a tour by their staff. It smells a bit weird in there but they have great equipment. Also, the staff watch and screen people like hawks--a bit annoying (like playing the Excuse me, but can I help you? guitar riff from Wayne's World), but if I had kids it would make me feel very safe having them go there.

<Content>Nice place to stay, small rooms, and get a room with a view. This is a very nice hotel, the only downside is the small rooms. But for business travelers or couples who are out on the town this place works well. They offer some great services. They printed my boarding pass for free, they offer drinks in the lobby, and also have cookies and milk in the lobby at night. And this may sound odd but the soaps in the bathroom were nice. Loved the smell, wanted to take some home with me. The room was also clean, which is a must! The other advice I have is to get a room with a view. My view wasn't great but over it was a nice place to stay.

<Content>Great Hotel-STAY THERE My husband and I stayed at the Harbor Court Hotel 8/08/-8/14 2008. We loved every aspect of this beautifully restored hotel.The stylish rooms are small but, there is enough storage in the drawers under the bed and in the closet. The bathroom has a long glass shelf. We had plenty of room for our things(don't overpack). Please, spend the extra money and get a king view room. It was so nice to look out of the windows and see the Oakland Bridge -day and night. I would especially like to thank Ross, Dulce(printing my boarding pass so that we got in the A group), Jason and all of the other day and night staff for making our stay so nice. We will come back!The hotel offers free coffee and tea in the morning, apples all day, freshly made iced tea in the afternoon,a wonderful hosted wine happy hour from 5-6pm everyday, and cookies and milk in the evening. We loved coming back to the hotel everyday!The hotel is located on the Embarcadero. The F streetcar is only a block away.You can take this to Fisherman's Wharf and to Union Square/Chinatown. We bought 7 -day MUNI passes for $24 dollars each and rode the streetcars, cable cars and buses everywhere. You can take the California cable car line on Market Street and then transfer to the Hyde and Mason/ Powell lines.This will also take you to Union Square/Chinatown and to Fisherman's Wharf. We even took a Market Street bus to Haight/Asbury. The hotel is in a quiet,upscale area. I liked that it was away from the touristy crowd. There are many restaurants in the area, a farmer's market and really nice arts and crafts venders . We ate at Scoma's at the Wharf, Boulevard and many Italian restaurants in North Beach. I would like to highly recommend the Piazza Pelligrini at 659 Columbus Ave. The food was excellent and the waiters were great.

<Content>Perfect South of Market location My one night adventure into the City was wonderful thanks to the great hospitality and extra attention I received on my visit to San Francisco. I am a local, born and raised in the area and wanted to spend a special, romantic evening in the City. My room had a spectacular view of the Bay Bridge and the Embarcadero. The staff was helpful and very friendly. I had a read mixed reviews of this hotel, but I contacted the hotel directly. The manager was extremely diligent and answered all of my questions promptly. I felt that the hotel very much wanted me to stay there and went out of the way to make my experience special. I can't wait to go back.

<Content>Comfortable Stay. Great Service We just returned from a quick one night stay at the Harbor Court hotel. It was me and my wifes first trip with our 8 week old son and were a little apprehensive about parking. Parking at the hotel was $40 bucks plus tax but was pretty hassle free. We were in the city for a wedding at Ghiradelli square so we checked in, showered, relaxed for a couple hours and then we called down for our car. It was available within less than 5 minutes.We did not have the oppertunity to take advantage of the amenities such as the YMCA next door, beer/wine reception, or the free apples but I did enjoy the Chronicle, NY Times, free Wi Fi and a cup of coffee on Sunday morning.The staff was great and very helpful. I would definitey recommend this hotel to my friends and family.

<Content>Lovely stay at the Harbor Court Hotel My mother-in-law and I stayed at the Harbor Court 7/23-7/28/08. Not only did we love San Francisco, but we also really liked the Harbor Court Hotel.The staff was fantastically helpful and friendly, the amenities were quite nice (things like the complimentary cookies and milk at night, apples anytime, lemonade during the day, free wireless internet in the rooms for those with laptops, cotton balls, q-tips, as well as shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc. make a difference for me), and the location was really convenient to public transportation, as you are within a few blocks of the Embarcadero Station where you can catch any number of trains or other MUNI transportation, the BART, or the California Cable Cars (go early in the morning on a weekday for no line). You can also catch the F line right to Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf within a block (ask the hotel staff how). Also, all of the rails that go down Market Street end at the Embarcadero, so it doesn鈥檛 matter which you take.We loved the post office being right across the street, the access to the Ferry Building and farmer鈥檚 market on Saturday, how close we were to some of the best chocolate in the city (two places in the Ferry Building and Fog City News 鈥?fogcitynews.com), and the comfort of the beds in the room.The hotel lobby and rooms are nicely decorated, although the view from our room of the courtyard was terrible. We saw a bunch of huge pipes鈥f you鈥檙e there for a while spring for the view of the Bay Bridge if you care about that sort of thing. It would have been nice to have two beds, but the hotel doesn鈥檛 have any at all.They let us check in early and held our bags until 4pm on the day of check-out for no charge.P.S. For the best postcards, you must check out Avant Card at Grant and Bush in Union Station. And you should go to the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in China Town. It's a bit hard to find, but you can handwrite your own fortunes and the lady will put them in a fortune cookie right in front of you.Overall, we loved our trip and would definitely stay at the Harbor Court again.

<Content>Horrible rooms I found this hotel on travelzoo and for the price of $109 per room/night it seemed great value considering the reviews on tripadvisor. Unfortunately we were disappointed when we got there - the rooms were tiny - and one of them (607) must have been a converted cupboard as it had a tiny strip window 6 ft from the ground - the colours were a depressing brown. There was no air conditioning in either room.The location is in the financial district - good for if you are in town on business or shopping in Union Square - for us though Fisherman's Wharf was a better and more happening place to stay with children.Staff were very nice - they mentioned that I would have to pay a $100 early departure fee as I agreed to it when I checked in (I don't think so!) and were quite happy to waive this when they heard what rooms we were in (602 and 607).So no I would never stay here again - or a Kimpton Hotel for that matter - I find it incredible that there are so many positive reveiws for this hotel on this site.By the way this is my first ever negative review on tripadvisor!

<Content>Fabulous Views, Ok service I stayed at the Harbor Court for business in July 2008. Now let me start by saying that I am not an inexperienced visitor to San Francisco. I think this is important only because the room rates tend to be expensive in this city and you tend to end up with a small amount of square footage for what you pay.My first problem with the hotelm began before I ever checked in. I had reserved a room for one night and my plans changed and I called to extend the stay. My rate was $135 so I called the hotel to check in one day earlier and was quoted a rate of $299. I immediately hoped onto expedia with whom I had originally made the review and they had a rate of $135 for the same room. I told this to the person on the phone and they indicated they would match it IF they could also find this rate. Ten minutes latter they honored the rate of $135. Moral of the story, although the Kimpton Website says they gaurentee the best rate....shop around.Upon arriving at the hotel no one was out front to offer to help with the bags, although this may seem like a nit, in San Francisco when traveling by yourself you need somone to get the bags and take the car so you can check in without getting a ticket.Upon checking in I was told that I would need to get new keys the nnext day as I had two seperate reservations...although not the end of the world, it was not convenient when staying more than one day since I have to expense all of travel back to my company I have twice the number of receipts that I needed.The room was nice (small, but again this is SF) but the view was amazing! If you stay her request the View room which has amazing views of the bay bridge and the Island!Service was luke warm the entire visit, depending on the website you look at they will give from 3.5 - 4 stars....my experience has been that service is better at some of the other Chain Hotel Properties.This hotel is good for business travel if your stay involves business SOMA or the financial district (near the embarcadero) any further than that and this property will be too far our of the way. Holiday visitors would be better to stay closer to Union Square or the warf as this is where you will most likely spend your time.I think this hotel counts too much on the location, and does not have enough substance to make it 4 stars.

<Content>Good location, pretty hotel - rooms on the smaller side I recently returned from an enjoyable stay at the Harbor Court hotel in San Francisco. The hotel is about 3 blocks from the Embarcadero BART stop and very convienant to all of the activity along the piers and ferry terminal. Highlights:-free access to the YMCA next door. An amazing facility with lap pool, bball court, full sauna, etc. I never thought I would be on a treadmill with a view of the bay bridge!-free cocktail reception every night with quality wine and beer-free fresh cookies and milk every night-good coffee and tea available at all times-great customer service-flat screen TVs, ergonomic desk chairs, iPod docking stations-across the street from the ferry terminal farmer's market (thursday/saturday - probably the coolest farmer's market I have ever seen. I highly encourage a visit)Lowlights:-a very, very small room (maybe 12' x 12') that takes a little getting used to. And a $50 flat surcharge for a room with a view of the Bay Bridge.The room we stayed in was well appointed, and we got used to the size, but I would caution any families from staying at the Harbor Court. Even finding space for a crib would be a challenge.San Fran is an amazing city. Go visit!

<Content>Nice Stay I wasn't sure what to expect after booking through Priceline and getting a very inexpensive rate. I was pleasantly surprised by the great customer service and nice extra perks the hotel provides. In the mornings there was a NY Times outside our door... even Sunday's which is $5. Downstairs they provide coffee and tea. At 5:00 they provide free wine and beer. The rooms are small but we weren't in the room very much so it was fine. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I left my camera bag and battery charger in the room, not realizing until we were out of the city, housekeeping found it and is shipping it back to me. The location is good and right near the Ferry Building although not as centrally located as Union Square. I would definatly stay again.

<Content>A great location for AT We were going to SF for a Giant鈥檚 game and wanted a hotel within walking distance to ATT Park. The Harbor Court fit the bill. In addition, the hotel was running a weekend promotional rate that in terms of SF hotel rates was great ($142.00 for a room with a view!).We arrived early afternoon and the associate that greeted us, Ross was awesome. He worked to have our room ready early and we checked-in around 2:00 p.m. The hotel charges $40.00 + tax per night for valet parking. If you want to save a buck, you can do one of the following:-If arriving on a Saturday night, you can park in front of the hotel for free after 6:00 p.m. and all day Sunday for free.-You can walk 陆 a block to the Howard St. Garage and self-park for $29.00 for a 24-hour period. We chose to park at the Howard St. Garage and it was fine.The Hotel:As a Kimpton Regular, this hotel fits with the brand. We booked a king with a view and I am glad that we did. Others have remarked how small the rooms are and they are right. The king gave us a little extra room and an awesome view of the Bay Bridge. Beware-In order to save space, the hotel has placed its beds on pedestals. That if fine, but the pedestals have sharp corners and if you are not paying attention, ouch!!.The bathrooms are tiny with no counter space. It was challenging for both of us to get ready.The lobby is the largest Kimpton Lobby I have ever seen. The wine-hour was actually enjoyable.As a Kimpton regular, I have now stayed at 4 of their San Francisco properties and rank the Harbor Court as my second favorite. I am still really happy with the Serrano,Bottom line, if you can get an awesome rate, stay here. It is steps from the Ferry Building and it will really rock on July 4th.I am a hotel diva and have no negatives about this place. Enjoy your stay.

<Content>Perfection! My husband and I spent 2 nights at this hotel and we had such an exquisite time, part of it because of our pleasant stay at this hotel. San Francisco is one of our favorite cities and although we've already been twice, there's always something that entices us to go back. The location is perfect! We've stayed in the Marina district before and realized that there wasn't too much of a big city feel in that area so we decided to book in the Financial District where the action is! Plenty of dining choices within walking distance. The Embarcadero is next door! Beautiful view of the bay bridge, especially at night. A quick bus ride to Union Square. We walked from the hotel to Embarcadero to Chinatown to Union Square and back! It's a bit of a walk, but the best way to explore is by foot! There are a handful of clubs within walking distance and it's a quick ride on the muni to the Castro district if you want to experience something unique. The staff was professional and non-intrusive. The rooms are spotless and quiet. Free wine at the lobby from 5-6 nightly and cookies and milk at 9pm. We'll definitely stay here again!

<Content>Very Pleased! You Should Stay Here!!! The staff here was awesome. Very clean hotel and room was immaculate!! Awesome hotel for the price. Our friends stayed at the W but I thought we got a better room at $150/night and not $250/night like what they paid. Can you say rip off? We needed to take a taxi up 3rd Street but were pleasantly surprised when the valet had the hotel car take us for $10 bucks! Really nice Crown Vic and alot better than the dirty taxis. I had no problem with the noise as a matter of fact I didnt hear a thing. I'm familiar with San Fran so expected a small room although was happy with the size. Come on....its San Fran and its compact.I will stay at Harbour Court on all my trips to San Fran. Great location as well.

<Content>Good Area Was in the area because of a business trip. The hotel was fine and we had a nice view of the water. It was small for 2 people but reasonably well appointed. There was wine served for an hour each evening in the lobby-lounge area. Overall, it was too expensive for what it was and next time I would chose others in the vicinity which I could see were better value for the money. I did enjoy the Embarcadero area with its delightful shops, fine restaurants and the excellent market in the Ferry Building. Fortunately we had sunny weather and walked to Union Square quite easily.

<Content>Great Location - Nice Extras! We just got back from a one night stay at the Harbor Court Hotel. This was a very nice experience and the location was top notch! The things we liked about the hotel: friendly staff, comfortable bed, complimentary wine/beer hour in the lovely living room/lobby area, warm cookies  milk before bedtime and of course - location!! Make sure to check out the Ferry Terminal Marketplace just across the street. Lots of great goodies! Yes, as everyone else mentioned - the room is small. But come on people --it's San Francisco! Many of the hotel rooms in SF are small. We didn't find it too bad (and we are large people!) If you can afford to get a room with a view - do it! We just had a small window looking out onto a wall, but we also paid half price using Priceline - so we didn't mind!

<Content>Small, but nice Our stay at the Harbor Court Hotel was very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were very nice. I stayed there for a weekend with my children, but thought it would be very nice for a romantic weekend in the city with someone special. The rooms are small, so if you are the type of person who stays at a hotel for all it has to offer, this may not be the place for you. However, if you are like me and go out of town to enjoy all that the city has to offer, and just like a nice place to come back to, this hotel is perfect. Great location, and pet friendly so you can bring the pooch.

We had access to the YMCA next door also. On top of that, we received a $135/night web rate. It is only a few blocks to the nearest BART station and is situation in a good location overall. You can access the train or bus, or just walk down to Fisherman's Whart.Overall, a good stay!

<Content>Loved Harbor Court I stayed at the Harbor Court for a business trip and loved it! A few days before I left, I received an email alerting me to a possible upgrade (very reasonable price) and applied for it. When I arrived, I had been chosen to receive this upgrade, which assured me a fabulous view of the Bay Bridge from my room. The room was smaller than most, but this is a boutique hotel, and with the two windows and mirrored wall (which made the room seem larger), I didn't feel the least bit cramped! The staff was wonderful and helped me whenever I had a question about where to eat, how far away something was, and how safe certain areas were. Room Service comes from the restaraunt next door and is exceptional!! I travel a lot, for both work and play, and the Harbor Court is where I'll stay again if I'm ever in San Francisco!

<Content>Great place to stay in San Fran We just spent our second visit at the Harbor Court, and we will certainly be back. Our company has an office in the Embarcadero Center, which requires us to stay in the area. The Harbor Court is just a couple of blocks from there and an easy walk. The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms aren't overly spacious, but adequate. The typical Kimpton touches such as complimentary wine in the evening, and fresh cookies at 9pm are nice. New York Times and Wall Street journals are available in the lobby and can be delivered to your door.A big bonus is the gym. The HCH is next to the YMCA and free passes are provided. I had never been to a Y and didn't really know what to expect, but the equipment is excellent! The staff at the Harbor Court always make sure you have a bottle of water to take with you as well.They have a Town Car that will take you to the airport for about $40 (as cheap as a cab). Plus, the overall price is low for SF. I have paid approx 220 - 260/night plus tax.Really lovely place to stay. Will definitely be back.

<Content>Everything was fantastic.... My fiance  I stayed at the Harbor Court Hotel for 2 nights. From the moment we walked in the front door to check in, we loved it. The staff were very friendly  helpful, the room was very clean, we liked the location, the coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the morning  the wine/beer happy hour from 5pm-6pm was great!We stayed in a part bay view room on the 8th floor. We had noise from the air conditioner units from the restaurant next door but we walked so much through the day that we slept through it! Next time we stay I will request a room with a full bay view.It rained all weekend  we still walked everywhere. It's not that far a walk from Union Square  it's all flat with no hills. We would recommend this hotel to most people. I wouldn't take kids though.

<Content>Location and view makes up for room size A little off the beaten path of the Union Square and FiDi mega hotels, yet it is just two short , safe blocks from a Muni/Bart Station. We had a bay view room w/queen size bed on the 4th floor. Yes, it is a small room but if you are a light traveler it isn't a deal breaker. The bay view room prevented it from being claustraphobic. When we first saw our room I was a little concerned that it might be noisy but the building is well sound proofed and we could not even hear other hotel guests. Many fine restaurants are nearby, as well as the Ferry Bldg. across the street on the bay side and YanK Sing for dim sum on the other side of the hotel. With public transport so close you can travel to a lot of great attractions and restaurants fairly easily. The staff was very professional and personable. Overall, a very nice stay.

<Content>Just ok When we first arrived we were able to have a early check in which was great. The atmosphere of the hotel was great as well as the lounge area with its fireplace and flat screen tv. Upon arriving to my room, I went into shock. The room is a staggering 145 square feet!! I have seen bigger motel rooms. Me and my wife kept bumping into each other whenever we both walked around the room. We only came to view the fireworks and thank God that we didnt have to stay any longer than a day. We were able to see the entire show (fireworks)as the barge was directly in front of the hotel! This was the best thing about the hotel.The flat screen tv was off centered from the bed which was ackward and it didnt swivel. The ice holder was so small the only thing you could have put on chill was a 12 ounce soda. The internet was absolutely great as well as the view of the water and bridge. The only drawback here was that the windows were only about 32 inches wide which meant if you really wanted to enjoy the view, you had to stand in front of it. The hotel has no restaurant , but a contract with japanese restaurant next door.Restaurant next door caters to the hotel but don't expect full breakfast. Most places around hotel are closed on the weekends which puts you far from most of the city action. The hotel also doesn't have a gym so if you want to workout , you'll have to go next door to the YMCA which has a contract with the hotel.Upon trying the shower we found out that the water was just luke warm. The clock radio implied that everyone owns a ipod so you couldn't play cd's -I feel anything over $200 should have a cd player. Later in the night we started smelling cigarette smoke. Thats when I noticed that the door had a slight crack that let light and smoke inside my room. Room is so small that theres no room for a coffemaker even if they tried to provide one. So they serve coffee downstairs to make up for it. So, now you will know why this place is so cheap for the location.

<Content>Stylish, Wonderful Location I stayed two midweek nights at the Harbor Court ( a Kimpton property) and found the location, amenities, and design to be top notch. The welcome is warm and gracious, and staff make an attempt to satisfy your every need. I paid $224/night for a deluxe king bay view room (senior rate on the Kimpton website), and while not inexpensive the rate was better than the larger chain hotels in the city, especially the Hyatt Regency and Le Meridien that are close by. I'm normally a loyal Starwood guest, but this time I decided to try Kimpton, and the experience was gratifying.Pluses:1) The location right on the Embarcadero is fantastic! Try for a bay view room. Over the years the Harbor Court's location has only become more advantageous as the Embarcadero has become increasingly people friendly. The Ferry Building with it's wide array of food and gift shops and restaurants is spectacular. The Harbor Court provides a jogging map with roundtrip mileage estimates from the Ferry Building to various points along the wharf.2) Typical for Kimpton, wireless internet access is complimentary. There are two iMacs in the lobby connected to a printer. Under 15 minutes is free, and you start paying for anything over that.3) Rooms are small, but beautifully and stylishly designed. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in, perhaps excelling over Westin's Heavenly Bed. A wall mounted LCD TV and Aveda bath amenities complete the room.4) Morning coffee service and evening wine tasting (another Kimpton tradition) is delightful.5) The Embarcadero YMCA is next door with complimentary access is to Harbor Court guests. Complete fitness facilities include a 25 meter six-lane pool.6) The BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) Embarcadero stop is two blocks away; so, one can get from SFO to the Harbor Court in under 45 minutes, including walking time from the BART stop to the hotel front door. Fare is about $5 each way from SFO. The Harbor Court is also easily accessible from the Oakland Airport via the same BART stop.7) Great restaurants within easy walking distance in the neighborhood: Ozumo (in the Harbor Court), Boulevard (at the end of the same block), Slanted Door (Ferry Building across the street), and One Market (two blocks away).Minuses:1) As mentioned before, rooms are small, and the majority of non-bay view rooms are interior and rather dark.No other disadvantages I can think of. I'll come here again!!

<Content>Small But Interesting Boutique Hotel I had to travel to San Francisco on business and all of my favorite hotel were booked solid. A co-worker of mine recommended this hotel and here are my thoughts:POSITIVES:1. Location and View: This place has a great location within walking distance of a lot of cool areas of San Francisco. The view from my room was incredible!!! I looked out over the SF BAy and had a stunning view of the Bay Bridge which I really enjoyed in the evening. 2. Room decor: Nicely apponted. It had a king bed, a small desk, a small plasma TV, two endtables and a chair. The bathroom was small but nice and clean with tile floors, a pedastal sink, and a shower-tub with decent water pressure.3. Internet in room was FREE. This is ALWAYS a major plus for me. 4. Lobby: Nicely decorated in a very ultra-modern fashion. Lots of cool places decor and places to sit and drink complimentary wine in the early evening or complimentary milk and cookies in the later-evening. Both of which were a very nice touch. NEUTRALS:1. Bed: Seemed very hard and not as comfy as I am used to in the Westins, Ws and Sharetons that I normally stay in. 2. Service: The front desk person was friendly but no one ever really went out of their way. NEGATIVES:1. Room Size: The room was VERY SMALL and the walk from the elevator to my room was long and confusing (the layout of the hallways leading to the rooms is very maze-like). 2. Price: I paid $299/night, which, in my opinion, is inordinately high for the size of the room and the amenities provided.

<Content>Excellent service, tiny bathrooms! As many have mentioned, the rooms here are not very large. The actual bedroom is a manageable size, though on the small size. The bathroom, however, was too small to fit our bathroom stuff - just one little shelf and one towel bar - nowhere to hang a hand towel, nowhere to hang towels to dry, not much room at all for makeup, face soap, etc. The Aveda bath products were quite nice, though, and were re-stocked every day.The other main negative about this hotel is the lack of room service - breakfast is available from 7-9am M-F and 7-10 Saturday and Sunday. On weekdays, you can order lunch from Ozumo during their regular lunch hours (11:30-2), but there's nothing available on weekends and nothing between 2 and when the restaurant re-opens at 5:30. Ordinarily, I wouldn't even notice something like this, but almost all of the restaurants around the hotel are closed on the weekends, leaving Starbucks and a market/deli thing as the ONLY options for a late breakfast or lunch on the weekends.Other than the size of the bathrooms and the lack of room service, this is a great property - nicely furnished and the staff was always super pleasant and helpful. I'm not sure if we would stay at this hotel again - it would probably depend on if we were going to be there over the weekend or not.

<Content>Very Thoughtful Service  I had a fantastic stay at the Harbor Court Hotel. I have to agree that the room was the smallest that I've ever seen. It was ok for the 2 of us but not more than that. But smallness aside, Harbor Court has everything that you need. The decor, cleanliness, service, accomidations, location (right next to the Ferry Building) are to the point. I was thrilled when Harbor Court left us a personal letter to wish me Happy Birthday along with a complimentary bottle of wine/glasses and chocolates for two. That was so thoughtful of them.Other unique items: free complimentary wine, cookies and milk at bedtime, options of turning down the cover/mints, Aveda bath products, umbrella for rainy day use, bath robes, LCD screen, Oxygen supply (w/ charge), Ipod dock station/radio/alarm, free complimentary limo service in the morning M-F to Financial district, complimentary newspapers, YMCA pass (where you can use free internet, this place is huge 4 stories, including an olympic size pool), sushi/sake room service (that was just awesome for a sushi lover like me), assistance with your bags and recommendations for sightseeing etc.The parking charges were extremely high, $38 not including tax, but we didn't mind it considering parking was just horrible in SF. You can't find parking anywhere, especially at peak hours. If you valet, Harbor Court will get your car anytime you like and you can call down 15 minutes ahead so you won't have to wait.I'm a total sucker for service and attention to detail so I will definitely stay at Harbor Court or any other Kimpton Hotel again.I would definitely give it a 5 if the rooms were bigger. For those who like a roomy space and don't care much about decor/service, this place may be a bit claustrophobic. But if you don't mind it like me than definitely stay here. Also, remember to call a few hours before you get to the hotel just to make sure you get what you ask for (esp. if you book a standard room with a view). Harbor Court fulfilled all my requests :0)

<Content>tiny rooms! We did the priceline thing and got this room. We we very excited cause the room was so cheap and looked pretty nice online. The hotel itself was not bad. The problem is the rooms were extremely tiny. There were two of us and it was unbearable. The staff was no help! If you a biz traveller staying there one night, it wouldn't be bad. Go to hotel vitale and pay the money, it will be worth it!!!!! That's what we did!

<Content>Nice hotel I stayed at the Harbor Court for business earlier this month. The hotel is directly across the Embarcadero and my room had a incredible view of the Bay Bridge. The rooms were a little small, but cozy and well-designed. The restaurant next door, Ozumo is said to be one of the best in the city for Japanese dining and there are several other good restaurants in the area. I would stay here again!

<Content>Highly Recommended Hubby  I stayed her from 8/25 - 8/29 and were very pleased. The location is ideal: 2 blocks from the F Market street car to Pier 39  Fisherman's Wharf, 2 blocks from local buses (21 Hayes  14 Mission), 3 blocks from the California St. trolley, 1 block from the Ferry Building, and walking distance from SF MOMA and CA Academy of Science  Steinhart Aquarium. Several bars / restaurants locally as well. It's a boutique style hotel with very comfortable accomodations (king size bed with ensuite bathroom). During our stay there was complimentary coffee  tea in the am, a free wine reception in the evening at 5pm and complimentary milk  cookies at 9pm. All of which were available in their very cozy lounge area. The staff were very friendly and very responsive. Hotel and rooms were well maintained. We were able to get a great deal of $79 per night from Travelzoo. Worth every penny and then some! We'd definitely go back.Tip - Consider purchasing the SF City Pass. It gives you free admission to several attractions as well as free transportation on all buses, street cars and trolleys for 9 consecutive days from the first day used. Worth it!

<Content>Awesome Hotel! Just returned home from a week stay at the Harbor Court. What a view from the hotel! We have nothing to say but good things about the hotel and the staff. The place was extremely clean, well centered to the city and just a wonderful place to stay. Nice touches like the bed turned down at night with chocolates on the pillows, light music playing and the lights turned down dimly was such a nice thing to come back to each evening. The wine/beer coctail hour in the lobby was a nice place to meet other travelers. Staff was VERY NICE! The hotel was very quiet since a lot of the people there were there on business. The Embarcadero was a nice place to stay.....close to transportation but not overcrowded like the Wharf. Close to the Ferry building and great restaurants. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in SF!

<Content>Friendly service Stayed at the Harbor Court Hotel three nights. It is a little pricey, but we got a good deal. Rooms are small, but if you are in SF and spending a lot of time in the room - what's wrong with you?Ask for a bay view, it has a great view of the Bay Bridge and Embarcadero. Clean room, comfortable bed, good shower. The thing that stood out to me was the service. We dragged in around midnight after a late ballgame. I went to the front desk to ask if ANYPLACE nearby was open for food (not expecting anything) and she wrote down the number of a pizza joint that delivers until 3am! The valet staff was very knowledgable and friendly as well!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Hubby and I stayed here for 2 nights and really enjoyed it. We did get a bay view room which was spectacular. The views of the Bay Bridge at night, all lit up, were outstanding. It made up for the room that could have been a tad larger but worked just fine for us since we were out and about most of the time. The decor was chic and comfortable, bed- very comfortable and the staff was friendly. The wine in the evenings - a nice touch. We went to see Jersey Boys one night (awesome show) at the Geary which was a quick cab ride from the hotel and we took the F line bus home. The next day we walked along the beautiful waterfront, just 7 long blocks to ATT ballpark. All in all a great experience, very convenient location. We always take Amtrak to SF from Sacramento and the stop is right across the street from the hotel so it's so easy and no paying for parking which is very expensive in SF.Only suggestion I have would be to provide more surfaces in the bathroom to put things on. It's workable but an additional shelf or 2 would really help for 2 people and all your bathroom stuff.A great place - we'll be back!

<Content>BEWARE of this hotel ! 1. I had the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE by this hotel staff EVER and I am a full time traveller. Completely rude and inhospitable and made feel about as welcome as a criminal. Had I not pre-paid for the entire trip in advance I would have moved hotels rather than be treated second class.2. The hotel website is misleading with pictures of rooms overlooking the bay bridge. Only the suites face the bridge, ALL THE OTHER ROOMS SIT DIRECTLY ON TOP OF TWO ENORMOUS AIR CONDITONER GENERATORS ON THE TOP OF THE ADJACENT BUILDINGS.... so ifthe view isnt bad enough the deafening noise IS!!!!3. If you are thinking of staying here I would quickly advise booking the HOTEL VITALE instead, it is closer to the ferry building, has better views on ALL sides and is owned by the much better run JOIE DE VIVRE group here in town. The rooms are also larger and new for the same price as cramped and dingy at this hotel.

<Content>Great Place to Get Work Done Among this hotel's other virtues is that it is a great place to get work done. I spent a week there and had to complete some serious writing in my room for about 3 of the 5 days. The place is very quiet and housekeeping staff were very accommodating at cleaning the room around my work schedule. The wi-fi (included in room rate) was also very helpful.

<Content>Cool Kitsch and Fun Vibe The Harbor Court is a charming little joint on the embarcadero with great views and some nice little touches. Upon arrival we noted that the valet service wasn't really well defined and later discovered that the bellmen were doing double duty. Check in was quick and they accommodated our request for early check in (10:30a). Valet for overnight seemed excessive at $38. The wine and beer cordial in the evening was nice, the wines were tasty and not just cheap swill and the beer was Sierra Nevada on tap. The room was small, but not too cramped, similar to NYC hotels. It had an iPod player on the clock radio and a flat screen LCD on the wall. The LCD was not tuned correctly for the aspect ratio and they should either get an HD signal or stretch the 4:3 picture. Nothing worse than watching a square picture on a rectangular screen. The bed was a tad on the hard side, any harder and I would say too uncomfortable for a good night sleep. Check out was quick and they held our bags while we spent the afternoon in the city. Staff was courteous, kind, and helpful. Location was nice, but they really weren't near much besides Market St. and the Embarcadero. Probably 1 mile west to Fishermans Wharf, 1 mile east to ATT Park.

<Content>Wonderful hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel late last year and it was a great experience. The staff is friendly and the location great. Note it's a long way from union square and fishermans wharf, but as long as you are aware of that it doesn't matter. One suggestion though if you want to blow the budget on a fantastic meal it's just down the road from Boulevard restaurant which is one of SF's finest. The only complaint I'd have is that the rooms are small, it is hard to get around that but if you pay more money they do have larger rooms with harbour views but I only saw those when I walked down the hall.

<Content>Beautiful Location, Great Experience My husband and I just returned from a week in California, where we spent three nights at the Harbor Court Hotel. We had a great time! I could find things to pick apart about this hotel, of course, like most others, but it really was a very pleasant stay. We had perfect San Fran weather, so being down on the Embarcadero was so nice! Our room did have the bayview- and I thought the $30 was worth it, especially if you get a good deal on the room. Housekeeping was terrific- our room looked like we hadn't even been there each time they came! We didn't get a chance to eat on site, but there are so many great food options nearby! The farmers market across the street on Saturday morning was really a treat. Overall, I think you will really enjoy your stay at the Harbor Court Hotel!

<Content>Quiet hotel in Embarcadero An actually quiet hotel in Embarcadero at the edge of Financial District. I saw a lot of reviews about the small room size but I've seen smaller rooms on other boutique hotels. Great service, nice complimentary car to downtown. Just across from Rincon center sogood dim sum (Yank Sing) is within walking distance. Just 1 block from Ferry Building so gourmet food is just 5 minutes walk away. Close to BART and F-line streetcar - no problem with public transit whatsoever. I did not book the bayview room but seriously - all you have to do is step through the lounge backdoor and you'll get the same view. Also I spent most of my time out of the hotel - so paying extra $30 per night did not really work for me.Overall - great stay experience.

<Content>Great hotel kind of close to Pier 39 I booked this hotel through a third party and got a great deal for $79. At this price, the hotel was fantastic!! The hotel is well-decorated, has a nice wine/beer reception in the evening. Though we mised it, they also have a milk and cookies hour later at night. The rooms are decorated quite nicely, but are a bit on the small side. I guess this hotel is a renovated YMCA? They have coffee and tea in the morning too. A nice add would be to offer breakfast.The staff was fairly helpful, as we had need for a crib and it was in the room upon checking in. We also needed some milk for the baby and they sent some up for us in a timely manner. That was a really nice touch.I think the only thing I would tell people to be wary of is that this hotel is further away from Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf than expected. We were told that it would be about a 20-minute walk. It is more like 40 -60 minutes. But we were pushing a stroller. It's only a block from the Ferry Building, which has cool cafes, delis, etc. On Saturdays, they also do a Farmer's Market.Anyway, pretty good location, GREAT deal, fairly friendly staff. I would definitely stay here again for that price!

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Spent a very enjoyable weekend at the Harbor Court Hotel in San Francisco. The location is great, in the Embarcadero area and just right across the street from a great farmer's market (on Saturday only). The hotel is not huge, in fact probably one of the smaller ones I've ever stayed at (not counting hotels in Europe), but it is beautifully decorated and the staff is very friendly and helpful. My room had one queen size bed (though it seemed a little smaller than a queen) and had a view of another building. The view really wasn't that important to me, I was just very impressed by how tastefully decorated the room was and how clean it was. Nothing looked worn down, everything looked new and straight out of Crate  Barrel. The bathroom was spacious and had Aveda bath products, which I love! Back to the bedroom - I'm not going to lie, it was tiny, but again made up for the fact by being so clean. There was a medium sized flat screen tv hanging over the desk and a large armoire that was used as a closet. My biggest complaint about the room was that I found the bed to be very uncomfortable. The mattress was a little too firm and the pillows a little too soft. I'm not joking, I prefer the mattress to be soft and the pillows a little more firm but that's just me. The hotel offered a hosted wine hour from 5-6 pm daily and they also offered fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and milk at nighttime. I checked out on Sunday morning and when I came down stairs they had a complimentary continental breakfast going on in the living room area. The hotel also offers complimentary wireless internet though I didn't make use of it. Overall I thought the hotel was great and through a deal I found on TravelZoo I only paid $79 a night (Friday-Sunday). I would definitely stay at a Kimpton hotel in the future though I might have to bring my own pillow along.

<Content>Very Pleasant - No complaints I have never had a bad experience at a Kimpton hotel. They are always very stylish, clean, and relaxing. Great amenities, and the staff is always very friendly. The Embarcadero is very pleasant to walk along, and the nearby Farmer's Market mall is great for all kinds of dining. Views of the bay are great. It's nice to be in one of the more quiet areas of the city, yet still close to downtown and easy for transportation. If you have a car, you can park in a nearby garage overnight for about $10 less than their valet fee.Also, if you are traveling with pets, no place is better than a Kimpton hotel, because they never charge extra fees and are very friendly to your pet.

However, the room is styled so nicely and sexy that it's not even noticed. Excellent bedding and appointments really set this place apart from other rooms in this town. It's San Francisco, how much time do you really expect to spend in the room!?!?!The bathroom is really nice sized considering the size of the room; plenty large enough for two people to navigate in. The Aveda products were also a nice surprise!The sitting room off to the side of the room was the best part; plasma screen on the wall, armoire for hanging up clothes, a mini bar and a loveseat. Even with all of that in the room it still didn't feel small to me.This room is perfect for two people coming in to town for a weekend getaway or one person traveling on business. I will certainly stay here again when I pass through.

<Content>Mixed Feelings My husband  I stayed for 2 nights and found it to be one of the most well-decorated hotels we've stayed in. We loved the contemporary linens, decorations. leopard-print robes and Aveda bath products. However, beware! There is no toothpaste provided. Rather, you would be expected to pay $3.95 for a mini-tube found in the mini-bar, which we thought was lame.We did feel the room was small, but right around what one should expect in the city anyway. There is no coffee maker in the room, but that is made up for by the hotel's provision of organic coffee  high-quality tea in their lobby/communal living room area, along with free wine  beer in the evening and milk  cookies in the later part of the evening.We thought the front desk staff was dispassionate--not warm, but not rude. The housekeeping staff on the other hand is very friendly. Parking is a pain as it generally is in the city, so I would suggest either parking down Howard Street in the open-lot parking which is roughly $16 from 8am - 5pm.Overall, it was not a bad deal, considering that we paid $70 on priceline. I found out that we could have upgraded to a bay view room for $50 per night, but decided to pass on it since we were planning to spend more time outdoors.

<Content>This place was highly ranked for a reason... I stayed there this last weekend in a Queen Room with a Bay View. I must say I was really frightened of a few reviews because so many said the rooms were tiny. But when I got to the hotel, my husband and I were very impressed. The room was a very nice size - it wasn't the biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in but not the smallest by a long shot. The view from each of the three windows was amazing. The room was spotless andbeautifully designed - great carpet, linens, curtains were cool. Thebed was really comfortable - all down and pillows. There was an ipod jack and dimmer lights and free wi-fi. The bathroom had great ammenities and Aveda toiletries and a great shower. Nice stereo and huge flat screen TV. A lot of other boutique hotels - esp. around Union Square - are kind of wannabe classy hotels. But not this place - this place had no scuffs, no burn marks, no little blemishes that detract from the overall comfort. It was spottless. I'm not a lobby person but we went down and made use of the wine reception - we probably had a good 4 glasses each :) and played checkers in the gorgeous lobby. The lobby was awesome - hip and comfortable at the same time - it was inviting. Fresh baked cookies at night an organic coffee/tea in the morning? Nothing wrong with that. I ate and drank my way through the freebies.I love to complain but I have nothing to complain about here - all in all, for the money I spent, this was the best deal I have ever had in San Francisco. I would go back again in a heartbeat.

<Content>best fireworks ever We have booked the Penthouse Suite and adjoining room for New Years Eve for the past two years and the fireworks from the Balcony are fantastic! The views from these 2 rooms are the best on the Embarcadero. This is not a huge suite but was perfect for us. The adjoining room to the suite can be booked seperately and is one of the larger rooms (although still small) it has a large floor to ceiling window that opens to a petite balcony overlooking the Bay Bridge, Treasure Island and the Ferry Bldg. The staff is very friendly and free wine in the afternoon and coffee in the morning is always appreciated. The lobby is very nice and quite comfortable and if you have a small room you may find yourself hanging out in it. If you can get a great rate the hotel is very nice, good beds, high quality linens, robes, etc. but without a view I would be reluctant to pay too much. The rooms at the nearby Hotel Vitale are much larger and the terraces on the 7th floor have spectacular views. The nearby restaurants are the best in the city and include Ozuma's, in the hotel, Boulevard, on the corner and the Slanted Door in the Ferry Bldg across the street. This is a fun, exciting and fairly safe area to stay in the city and free music is often found at the Ferry Building or at Chaya's restaurant.

<Content>Excellent SF hotel that is actually QUIET! I enjoyed the one night I was able to stay at the Harbor Court. The room was small--I didn't read the reveiws regarding this until I had returned home--but everything was there that I needed and it was clean and comfortable. Attending a conference at the Moscone, the staff was very willing to call for transportation, get us a seat at the excellent Japanese restaurant next door or to fill our every need. I felt very welcome here. As for the street people, where in San Francisco can you go to avoid them? Right outside the back door of the lobby is the Bay Bridge--Beautiful!

<Content>Great location-attractive hotel The hotel is very attractive- lovely lobby area with fireplace and colorful furnishings. Our room was a queen- small, but totally functional. Drawers under the very firm and comfortable bed, flat screen T.V., Armoire and lovely draperies, linens and mini bar. Unfortunately we had an interior room -which faced the other side of the building. There was still tons of natural light, however, and windows that kept the noise out. The bathroom was well equipped as well with Aveda products, decent towels, hairdryer,etc. Parking is pricey ($38) - cheaper garages are down the street. Front desk staff were attentive and friendly.The location is great- close to all public transportation, the Saturday Farmer's Market (the best spot for amazing breakfast pastries and coffee- not to mention the amazing fruit and vegetables!) Two great restaurants nearby- 'Boulevard' or the 'Fog City Diner'......for $75 on Priceline, quite a good deal!

<Content>Small but well equipped, aesthetic rooms Although the rooms are European size, even large compared to hotels in London, they are aesthetically designed and have everything one needs: desk, hi-tech chair, large flat panel TV. Even though the room was compact, the bath room was quite large. The only problem I encountered with the room was that I had to move the desk chair to make room for the ironing board and there were not enough electric outlets. My room faced the inner court (roof top), but I didn't have any expectations for a view. The service provided by the reception desk was excellent - I left a signed document and they arranged for Fed Ex pick-up and filled out the forms after I checked out. The location is excellent - not far from Pier 2. On the same block there are several trendy restaurants, including a Japanese one adjacent to the hotel. The wireless internet worked without any problems. I can recommend the hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Loved it! My husband and I stayed here for one night over President's Day weekend. We got the room for $89 on Priceline, which was a pleasant surprise. Even though we both work in this area every day, it was fun to be there on a weekend. There is a lot to do - the Ferry Plaza shops, walking along the Bay, very nice restaurants - plus easy access to BART and MUNI so you can get anywhere in the City easily. We did not feel that we were given second class treatment because we were there through Priceline, on the contrary, all the staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was tiny but the bed was very comfortable and everything was stylishly done. There are a lot of little extras, such as free internet in the lobby, free coffee, cookies and wine at different times of the day. We would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to visiting friends and business associates.

<Content>Great location, tight accommodations I have stayed frequently at the Harbor Court for business and a couple times for personal travel -- it is a charming property with the size and configuration of rooms that you'd expect of a renovated YMCA! Yes, the room is tight and you usually have to relocate a chair or otherwise temporarily rearrange for your personal preferences, but the furnishings are chic and comfortable otherwise. The baths are comfortably sized and have nice Aveda toiletries. Complimentary use of the adjoining YMCA fitness facilities is a huge business traveler or even tourist perk. You're right down the street from the fabulous Ferry building and a short walk from the city's unique attractions. Pay a little extra for probably the closest window you'll get to the Bay without your own mortgage. The room rates overall are a great value in a big city and for this location. I have not been thrilled that the staff always fail to recognize my frequent traveler/Kimpton rewards program status but they're cordial about forgetting at least.

<Content>Great for single person Stayed here 2 nights last weekend through a great deal I got on Priceline ($90/night plus tax). I've never had a smaller room at a hotel, but it was well appointed and the bedding was great. As a single traveler I was fine, however 2 people would be tight. One wall was completely mirrored, which visually opens up the space and would also be ideal for horizontal entertainment :-) I don't mind rooms that face courtyards in urban environments since they are usually quieter. Unlike other reviewers, the hotel was going to charge $10 to use the Y. Since I was already a Y member I could get in with my Y card for $3. The hotel staff were always helpful. The Saturday market at the Ferry Building down the block is fantastic. I would definitely stay here again if I was traveling alone.

<Content>Good experience Stayed here last week at $200 per night for a room with no view. If you bring your signficant other, I would suggest getting a room with a view of the Bay Bridge. It is a beautiful sight when it is lit at night. I have a lot of business in the Embarcadero area and usually stay at the Griffon which is a decent boutique (small, brick walls, unusual deco) two doors down. Turns out the Griffon was more expensive this particular week and the Harbor Court appears to have better reviews so thought I would give it a try.My room (503) was surprisingly large and comfortable. The king size bed was really nice to my sensitive back I had a sitting area and a good size desk. The hotel has a good wireless network so I was able to do work efficiently. As I was leaving for meetings each day, I would get a glimpse of other rooms which were being serviced. There were some that were very small and are consistent with some of the negative reviews on this site so suggest that you book direcly with the hotel which gets you free access to the YMCA next door and allows you to make special room requests. The YMCA was recently renovated and is a very nice facility.The service I received was fine. Check in/out was fast and easy. I was welcomed with smiles on my way out each day and upon my return. I didn't have any special service request so I can't say that I really tested them. But it seemed to me that they were going out of their way to be friendly. Perhaps, management is reading some of the recent negative reviews on service.I will most likely stay here again on my next trip to SF.

<Content>TINY Rooms, rude staff My platonic male friend  I arrived at the Harbour Court hotel after a 28 hour flight from Bali. We requested a room with two beds and was told there was only only two rooms available in the whole hotel, ours (with one bed) and the penthouse. (Although I overheard a another clerk telling another client that there were rooms available) I was looking forward to a comfortable sleep in my own bed. But I was forced to stay in a tiny bed with my friend who's 6'4. I very nicely requested a cot and was told the hotel does not have them. Then I requested extra pillows so I could sleep on the floor and that request was never filled. The snooty clerk who was on duty, snidely told me to go have some 'cookies and milk in the lobby... very insulting! The room was VERY tiny, the bed small and there was barely enough room to sleep on the floor. The next morning I hoped to sleep in late after my friend caught an early flight, but the room was very loud. I could hear the elevator clearly although the room was half way down the hall. The sound echosed in the hallway. The bathroom was very small and poorly designed. I had to step inside the shower and get sprayed with cold water in order to turn the water on. The hotel advertised it unique decor, but except for a bed canopy and flat-screen TV (The room was too small for a traditional TV) it didn't look much different than a holiday inn

<Content>Great hotel, great location! Booked our rooms through Hotwire at a cheaper rate for a four-day visit to San Francisco from London, and the hotel exceeded our expectations. All the staff were very friendly and we availed ourselves of the nightly wine tasting, followed by milk and cookies later on - an unusual and pleasant touch. True, rooms are small, but very comfortable and stylish; we knew this before we booked, so weren't surprised. Didn't have a bay view as that's more expensive, but you don't need that as the hotel is right on the Embarcardo - perfect for morning/evening strolls/jogs. Another plus is the Amtrak railway office just across the road (not the train station - that's in Oakland, I think), where you can conviently catch a bus to the station and then travel by those wonderful Amtrak trains to anywhere in the US. Used the YMCA gym next door (again, they were very friendly), and the post office across the road is very handy for sending postcards etc. The BART station from SF International Airport is very close as well (can't remember the name of the stop, though). The Ferry Building is just across the road as well, containing a wide variety of shops and places to eat. Best of all is the ferry that takes you to Sausaulito in about 20/30 minutes, right past Alcatraz. All in all, this was a real find, great value for money and in a wonderful location in a wonderful city.

<Content>Two kinds of service at the Harbor Court Hotel I booked a last minute stay through Hotwire at the Harbor Court Hotel to enjoy a one night stay in San Francisco for Columbus Day. It's a great location close to the Embarcadero Waterfront and the Ferry Building's wonderful shops. I walked to North Beach to watch the Italian Heritage Day Festival and took the underground Muni to shop at the brand new Westfield Shopping Centre which, by the way, has the best food court of any mall I've ever been to.Mind you, the hotel has great amenities but I felt treated like a second class citizen because I booked my trip through Hotwire. When I checked in, the front desk person told me that all she had available was a full-size bed as all the larger beds were completely sold. I asked for a bayview room and she told me that I would have to pay $50 more to have that.When I got to my room, I was shocked to see how small it was! At first I couldn't find the television and then I looked up toward the ceiling and saw there was a small flat screen tv in the corner. Then I wondered where the dresser was, and I finally found a drawer underneath my mattress. The bed was a true full-size, and I wondered how my partner would have been able to stay with me had he been there! The bathroom was a good size, though, but I would've given up some of that space to have more room. There was a desk and a chair. Overall, I was amazed at how they utilized such a small space.After seeing my room, I went downstairs to see if there was a bigger room available but the front desk person told me they were all sold out. I overheard her telling other guests that the YMCA next door was complimentary. When I asked her about it, she said that was only available to those who book directly with the hotel. She told me that I would have to pay a fee to use it.The pluses with the hotel are definintely the decoration and the decor. It is a very modern looking place that fits the San Francisco style. They also had a nightly wine tasting, fresh chocolate chip cookies at 9 pm, and complimentary coffee/tea service in the mornings. They also delivered a NY Times to my doorstep.This was my first opportunity to stay at a boutique hotel. If I had a bigger room, then I probably would've given this a higher rating than a 3. But I felt that because I ordered this through a third party website that I was treated differently.If you book directly through the hotel, then I would definitely recommend this place. But if you book it through a third party website, then I would caution you to be not get your hopes up with your room size and service. If you end up with a big room, be thankful and enjoy your stay!

<Content>This hotel is a gem! You can't beat the price of this cute little hotel. Travelers with disabilities may find it hard to navigate the stairs to the upper lobby. The hotel is on the embarcadero, so it is not very convenient to Union Square or Fisherman's Warf (walking). It would take about 15-20 minutes to walk to either location. However, it is convenient to Muni, Bart and the cable cars if you don't want to walk. The hotel is on the outskirts of the financial district and is easily accessible to businesses near the Embarcadero (South of Market). The nightlife around the hotel is lacking, but there are some excellent restaurants nearby including Boulevard (A+). The hotel has some nice touches including flat screen tvs, great room decor, Aveda toiletries and complimentary evening wine. Those who are on a budget won't feel like they are staying at budget hotel!

<Content>fabulous location I had a quick 2 day stay in San Francisco before heading out to Napa/Sonoma and was looking for a home base. The Harbor Court fit the bill perfectly. I took the BART from the airport to the close-by Embarcadero station and walked over the few blocks to the hotel. You can easily grab the F-line over to Pier 39  Fisherman's Wharf or jump on the California cable car line at the foot of Market. There seemed to be all kinds of transportation options close by. If you are looking to get out for a jog, they provide route maps for various distances along the Embardadero. There are great restaurants right on Steuart St. (I ate at Faz and Ozumo) and plenty of food services in the Ferry Building. You can also pick up a great breakfast at the Saturday morning farmers market behind the Ferry Building. I had a room with an amazing view of the Bay Bridge. And even though they are indeed small, the rooms are funky and bright...not your typical, bland, cookie cutter rooms. My only issue is that there is currently some scaffolding on the front of the building so your view is affected slightly. The staff was very friendly and the daily wine reception seemed to be well attended. I'd stay there again in a second.

<Content>wonderful! our last night of a 2 week holiday in california was spent here, having spent the 1st 4 nights at the crowne plaza on union square,{also excellent} we wanted to stay in a different area for the last night and were torn between the embarcadero and fishermans wharf - we made the right choice! the hotel is lovely - very different in style to all the others we stayed in and it was beautiful, from the lobby to the corridors to the room - lovely colourful bright decor. we were on the 8th floor in an inside room overlooking the courtyard - not a spectacular view but pleasant enough and nice and quiet. the room itself was smaller than the others we;d stayed in but was big enough for 2 easily and was very comfortable with a lovely little bathroom with very nice - aveda- products. there was a mini bar that we used for our own things - the only thing lacking was a coffee maker - i kept looking for it but it wasn;t there. having said that, there was free tea/coffee/water/juices etc in the lobby in the morning, but, being english, we do lke a cup of tea 1st thing without having to get dressed! the staff were wonderful, the marathon was on on the sunday and the road was closed supposedly until 2.30pm and our flight was at 4.20pm which meant we couldn;t get transport to pick us up - didn;t fancy lugging all our luggage to the bart! however the road re-opened early and the staff arranged for a shuttle to collect us so all was well - actually it was very exciting watching the marathon once we knew we were okay for getting to the airport! the location itself was lovely - just across from the ferry building and very close to the bay bridge, which looked lovely all lit up at night - some of the rooms on the front would have a view of it.we ate at afz 2 doors down at the hotel griffon which was excellent. there is also a free use computer in the lobby which meant i could check in on-line for the flight back - very glad i did when we saw the queues at checkin - this was a real plus as we didn;t expect to be able to do this not having a laptop with us. all in all the harbour court made the last night of a fabulous holiday complete.

<Content>When they say small rooms, believe it! We stayed at two hotels in San Francisco, Hotel Palomar and the Harbor Court. Our stay at the Palomar was fantastic, sorry to say we did not like Harbor Court. Other reviews have stated that Harbor Court has small rooms. What they should have said is tiny. We booked a King Deluxe with view, $242 per night, which I believe is the best room available. We had Room 526, and when the maid was cleaning the room across the hall, that room looked just as small but had a window unit air conditioner. Ours at least had central air. True, this is a historic hotel and it is old, but when you have to turn sideways to pass your spouse at the end of the bed, it's too small. And neither of us is a large person. There is nowhere at all to put your suitcase so mine blocked the door and had to be moved to get out. There is a small wardrobe, which also housed the robes, iron, and ironing board, which didn't leave much room for clothes. The reason I chose this hotel is for the view of the Bay View bridge. The windows are old and small, and during our visit there was ugly metal scaffolding over that side of the building. Big disappointment. The bathroom is also very small, and there is only a small shelf to put personal items. The only good thing I can say is that the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. Thank goodness we only stayed there one night, it was very uncomfortable being crammed into such a small space.What bothered us most about this place was the staff. There were some bright spots, but they weren't as accomodating or professional as the other hotel we stayed at (Hotel Palomar). We heard some people making complaints (room size was one of them) and they really didn't seem to care. Our experience with the concierge and bell desk wasn't good. Since this hotel doesn't have a restaurant for breakfast, we asked for recommendations and was told there was a good one 3-4 blocks away. It was actually 8-9 blocks away, which would have been fine but we had to stop and ask someone else because we thought we had gone the wrong direction. Also, when we got ready to leave it took quite a while to get a taxi; the bellman kept trying to get us to take the towncar to the airport for $45. When a taxi finally came, it was an old guy wearing houseshoes, and we saw him pay the bellman money. So, maybe they only call taxi companies that will pay a tip to the bellman, and that's why it took so long. We had to tell the driver to step on it because he was driving so slowly that everyone was passing us like we were standing still. While we were waiting for the taxi, we heard the same bellman tell other guests that it would take 15-20 minutes to get their car because he had to get us into a taxi; guess he had to wait for his tip. But, if I had paid the high price for valet parking I would have been very upset (and they weren't too happy).Wouldn't stay at this hotel again, we didn't like it at all. We loved San Francisco and will return but not to Harbor Court.

<Content>Harbor Court Hotel Embacadero Stayed at the Harbor Court this July 2006. We got our rate through bidding service noit sure if I am allowed to post the site but you can search websites that will actually tell you what the actual hotels will be. We paid 96 per night which I thought was a steal. We were very happy with the accomodations. This hotel is defintely very clean, trendy, quiet, room was small ( we did not upgrade to their view rooms, but did not spend too much time in the hotel and anyway SF has so many great views anyway all over the city. A must is a visit up to TWin Peaks on a sunny day....all I can say is wow! I slept so good in the hotel, and liked the fact that I could put on the fan at night, not the ac just for some background noise which I must have to sleep. The Aveda products were a plus and the wine hour is great but make sure you get there at 5 because they will literally take the wine away at 6. The location seemed very safe, 2 minutes from the Ferry building, loads of restaurants in the area, the trams on Market Street will zip you up and all over the city. The bedding was very nice, room was furnished fashionably. All around a great place to stay in and would def recommend it! I am quite picky and getting weirded out staying in hotels, just cant sleep but this place was awesome!

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous!! My boyfriend had to take a state exam in SF early on a Saturday morning. I hit Priceline, per usual, for our room. I got this hotel for about 75% off the standard rate published on their website. We didn鈥檛 make it up to the City until almost 10 pm on Friday night. Our room was waiting room, no problem. Staff was super friendly and gave us a great tip for a late bite to eat just across the street at the Cosmopolitan. The Japanese place next door was packed and we were very underdressed and tired. The staff鈥檚 suggestion was perfect: stylish with a small jazz band and bar with upscale tidbits, but overall very casual. Back at the hotel: the rooms, I read, are on the small side, but ours was fine and wow did it look great; very modern, stylish and comfy. Aveda bath products were provided in the bathroom. Our room didn鈥檛 have a view, one of those Priceline drawbacks you learn to accept, but we didn鈥檛 miss it. Location was perfect too: three blocks from the BART station; two blocks from the F-line and other MUNI lines too. Hotel is practically across the street from the Ferry Building where there鈥檚 a fabulous Farmer鈥檚 Market on Saturdays. Though we didn鈥檛 use it, there was a courtesy car available if we needed it. A++ in my book.

<Content>Nearly Perfect I picked the Harbour Court from TripAdvisor knowing nothing about it, but I used to live in SF, and knew the neighborhoods. I didn't want to be in Union Square or Nob Hill, because there's nothing there but overpriced shopping and tourists. This was a great choice! Pricey, but we got a view room at the last minute, and loved watchhing the ships go by, the bridge, the water. Very romantical. Small room and small windows, but nice decore, stylish lobby, great strolling to the Farmer's Market, the Ferry Building, the Embarcadero, lots of great dining nearby, and even walkable to the ballpark! Valet parking is pricey, and parking in the area is terrible (all meters), but free on Sundays. The Japanese restaurant was too loud and crowdy, but plenty of other good options nearby.

<Content>Harbor court is awesome!! We were originally planning on staying in somewhere in Union Square... boy am I glad we didnt!! First of all, the Harbor Court was a great value - paid $85 for a saturday night through Hotwire (3.5* - Boutique, Restaurant). And the location is unbeatable. The Embarcadero is nowhere near as crazy as Union Square and has great freeway access (although they have closed the Embarcadero off-ramp from the Bay Bridge). If you're there for a weekend, dont worry about the parking - there's plenty of safe, nearby street parking available. I parked our junky rental right behind Mercedes SLK on Howard St. - and both were still there in the morning. Instead, we spent the $40 to upgrade to a king room with a view! (note: I called beforehand to upgrade and they quoted $70. so try to hold off until check in if you can... they might be able to hook you up!). Everybody was extremely kind, the decor is classy yet comfortable, and most importantly - the place is clean. As noted, the rooms are a little small, but the bed is extremely comfortable, the bathroom is more than adquate (they give you q-tips!), and the view!!!! All I gotta say is wow. Clear view of the bridge and Tresure Island and all the happy people walking along the water - you are really that close!! We woke up Sunday morning and took a leisurely stroll/jog to ATT Park (the Giants were on the road). The stadium is only about 0.75 mile away... and they actually open a portion of the park to the public for free, so we went up and took a little tour. I'm a Dodger fan, so I was talking some smack, but you cant deny that this ballpark is one of the most beautiful around. On the way back, we stopped by the Ferry Building and the farmers market. The farmers market wasn't so great as there were only like 10 vendors - I later found out that the main farmers market day is Saturday. But the Ferry Building is worth checking out and we picked up some yummy breakfast and ate it outside, watching the sailboats go by.Couldnt make it for the free beer and milk and cookies, but the coffee in the lobby is pretty good! The Embarcadero has everything you need and you get the TRUE SF experience. And if you REALLY need to goto Union Square, its less than a mile away. Definitely stay at the Harbor Court.

<Content>Excellent hotel in San Francisco The Harbor Hotel is a treat! I've stayed in San Francisco several times before, mostly for one-night stays, but this was the best yet. I picked this one based on reviews posted here and was not disappointed.The rooms are rather small, but not as small as I thought they would be. It was a King room, the most affordable in the hotel. The decoration is very fun and elegant, extremely clean. We didn't have a view but it didn't matter to us. It was very quiet, we neither heard traffic nor neighbors. We were also next to the elevator but never heard it either.Everyone on the staff was gracious and welcoming -- from the people at the front desk to the maids. Checking out was a breeze. We got the bill under our door and final check out took less than a minute. The location is great. You're right on the Embarcadero, with restaurants all around, the famous Ferry Building and close to the Baseball park. Things to keep in mind:- Breakfast at the hotel is outrageously expensive. But not to worry. You can find plenty of places to have breakfast or Brunch within walking distance.- Getting to the hotel is tricky. Their street address is Embarcadero but that is misleading. The actual entrance is in the back, that is on the street parallel to Embarcadero on a one-way street. Check with the front desk directly for directions, do not rely on the Web site.I would definitely recommend this hotel. In fact, I hope to go back some time soon!

<Content>VIEW ROOM IS A MUST The view rooms here are amazing. Request a high floor, looking out, all you'll see is water. Gives you that cruise ship effect. Rooms here are small but nice and comfortable. Also like most Kimpton hotels, it hosts a wine hour, in which they serve wine and beer complimentary.

<Content>This one's worth a visit I spent only a short time at the Harbour Court Hotel but it was an incredible experience. From the excellent location just minutes from major San Francisco attractions along the Embarcadero and a major BART train station, to the cozy rooms with swank furnishings, there was much to enjoy. The hotel staff was always friendly and the colorful, plush lobby's a gem. At 5 nightly, there's a free wine party and some evenings there's also cookies and milk to greet guests at 9 p.m. Never got the use the YMCA next door, but heard it was a nice one. I went for long walks along the boardwalk instead.You must check out the food shops across the street in the Ferry Building. A food critic told me you can dine there all day and know you're getting some of the best food in the city. I went alone for business but will definitely be back with my husband for fun!

<Content>Great hotel for business or alternative to the usual tourist hotels My 4 night vacation stay at the Harbor Court Hotel was quite good. I booked using Hotwire and as expected I got a very average room with a view looking out to the hotels AC unit. Not a problem for me as I prefer white noise anyway.All the advertised amenities were present, but some things were slightly odd. I knew the room was going to be small ahead of time. However there were 2 support beams (or pillars if you will) that made the wall jut out about 10 inches and was 12 inches wide. This made walking around the bed a toe-stubbing nuisance and the desk chair could not freely pull away from the desk. Tight manuevering to get seated. There was some paint chipping in the closet and doorway. On my second day there was a guy painting the hall outside my room. Luckily the fumes were faint. Also there was a bit of an electrical short in bathroom light switch. Had to flip switch a few times to get it to work properly. LCD TV was mounted above closet(!?), not centered in relation to the bed and/or desk chair. Lobby staff was just average. Any friendliness from them was not genuine.Beyond those minor concerns, the hotel was very nice. This location is fantastic if you want to avoid the Union Square and Fishermans Wharf touristy areas. Some friends that are native San Franciscans commended my choice. Easy access to MUNI bus, rail, and cable car (California St.) as well as BART (Embarcadero station). I was not around enough to partake in the coffee, wine, and cookies very much. The lobby computer with printer is a nice touch for making maps and directions so you can explore SF. My bed was very comfortable! Good sized bathroom. Shower was more than adequate. Housekeeping did a nice job. Expensive minibar but there is a Walgreens and 7-11 a block away for food and supplies. Ice machines on 3 floors. Nice modern AC unit in the room which is kind of rare for boutique hotels in SF. I liked the decor very much.When I return to the Bay Area I will definite shop for a good rate on the Harbor Court Hotel. I recommend it to anyone visiting on business or any tourist that prefers to stay away from busy the Union Sq. or Fishermans Wharf hotels and still enjoy a waterfront location will great transportation options.

<Content>Great place This is an excellent place to stay (FYI: I rarely opt for anything less than a 4-star). Conveniently located in Embarcadero, only a few minutes taxi or walk from Union Square, Fisherman's Warf, etc. Right across the street from the new Ferry Building that has terrific shops selling gourmet food products. Wine hour is terrific (5-6 pm) and free milk and cookies (9pm) are a nice touch to create a cozy community atmosphere among guests wanting to lounge in between day and evening plans. All in all, you will be pleased. Clean, tasteful decor, and very friendly staff. Note that some of the rooms are fairly small and without views of the street or bay, but those are likely for those of us receiving highly discounted rates (i.e., priceline, etc.). If you're getting a great rate (circa $100 p/night) this shouldn't deter you.

<Content>Simply Outstanding Quite simply a fantastic hotel. Stayed here on the first two nights of our Honeymoon, and what an incredible place. From the top-notch staff, to a great wine reception in the evening (free), to cookies in the evening.... The views we had of the bay and the Bay bridge were breathtaking. Great, safe location, walking distance to everything. What an incredibly comfy bed too!! I can't say enough... STAY HERE... Unless your just incredibly pretentious the Harbor Court cannot be beat.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel I spent the day at the Harbor Court, and it was very nice. The lobby decor is great, the front desk is friendly and accomodating. The rooms are small and look just like the website. The use of the YMCA next door is wonderful. Also the hotel is in walking distance to the Embarcadero shops and restaurants down near Fisherman's Wharf area...The location is not close to downtown so you will need to use public transportation, cab or rental car to get to the key tourist attractions if you are not big on a lot of walking. I walked to the convention center and it was not that bad...but I like to walk...enjoy your stay!

<Content>A Terrific Hotel; No regrets It is a pleasure to write a review about this hotel. My wife and I stayed there for three nights during the first week of September 2005. We made reservations through Priceline and obtained a room with a queen sized bed for a bargain price of $110.00 per night.Before we checked in, the hotel gave us the opportunity to look at a room with the queensized bed and one with a king sized bed. For an extra $20 per night we opted for the larger bed (and room). It was well worth it. The bed and sheets were excellent.The television is an about a 24 LCD. Though the picture was fine, it was a little too small for the room. The desk staff was very kind and helpful. However, I am giving the hotel only an above average review instead of and excellent review, because of an event at check in.My wife and I arrived several hours before the normal check in time. I was suffering from a splitting migraine headache. The fron desk staff tried to get housekeeping to make up the room to get us checked in. However, it took housekeeping about two and a half hours to complete their assignment.Other than that one expericence, our stay was fabulous. The bell man serves as valet, concierge, and car valet, which is too much for one person. However, both gentlemen were enitrely helpful with directions and suggestions.I forgot to mention that the hotel is centrally located. Fishermen's Wharf is just a short bus/trolley ride away. China town is a 20 minute walk away. You are just a couple of blocks from Market Street.In short, here are my suggestions:1. Get a king sized bed. Splurge a little. The room is larger, and of course, the bed is bigger.2. Don't forget to go downstairs at 5 pm for free beer and wine; or at 9 pm for milk and cookies.Our expericnece, over all, was above average. In my opinion, if all things remain equal, you will enjoy your stay.Regards,Scott

<Content>Fantastic location for first time visitors We stayed three nights in August and loved this hotel. It was perfectly situated (metro stops, Embarcadero and most importantly, SBC Park for some concerts we saw). The staff were friendly and promptly rectified a billing error with no argument or hassle. Although we were never in when they had the warm cookies and milk, the fact that it was available made it even better. The standard room we had was tastefully decorated and cozy but fine for the amount of time we spent there. One note: we had thought the Y was free for guests to use, but in fact there was a $10/day charge. Overall, would stay there again and highly recommend it.

<Content>Elegant Friendly Place The young and friendly staff of the Harbour Court should give lessons to the staff of other hotels. One genuinely feels welcome and wanted and most of all comfortable immediately upon entering. It's just like everyone says. Fantastic location. Beautiful design. Small but well appointed and luxurious rooms. I especially loved the Aveda bath products and the incredibly soft linens. The view is unparalleled. I went for a self-indulgent weekend for my birthday and left feeling indulged and happy. Thanks Harbor Court!

<Content>Great find for biz travellers San Francisco has a bunch of boutique hotels, but the one I like best for business travel is the Harbor Court Hotel on the Embarcadero. Received a warm welcome upon check-in. The room was small, but tidy and elegant, with an LCD TV on the wall, a yoga package, and windows that open. If you're going to stay in the City, might as well have some fresh air. Although I didn't have a Bayview room, the hotel itself looks out on the Bay Bridge, so you can see the gorgeous scenery out front. It's also next door (has its own private entrance) to the state-of-the-art YMCA with huge pool, oodles of machines, and a view to kill for. If you need to get outside, the Embarcadero is right there, you can run and walk to your heart's content. The hotel is surrounded by good food, including the Japanese restaurant, Ozumo. My colleagues had a blast there, they had never tasted food quite like the flavorful dishes we had. There is also a nightly wine and beer reception in the lobby, and on Tuesdays, a sake tasting reception. We found it a great way to meet other travellers and do some networking. Also, the hotel is wireless, so we were able to meet each day in the wonderful arty lobby, where we could hook up to our heart's content.Plus, BART and Muni are right there, we didn't have to rent a car. Perfect location. They also had a towncar on hand for anyone needing that form of transportation. Needless to say, I had a most productive stay, able to accomplish so much with our meeting, that it was a joy. The staff went the extra mile to ensure we had a good business meeting, including giving us a powerstrip and speaker phone, when we had an emergency conference call. Superb.The hotel also accepts dogs, as I was greeted by a jolly bulldog upon arriving. Alas, the dog was not the hotel mascot, but belonged to a guest. It would be smashing to have a doggy mascot, who I could look forward to seeing each time I arrive. This hotel will be a second home for me, and I think it might wind up being something special for others, also.

<Content>Good stay at the Harbor Court San Francisco Had a very pleasant stay for one night at the Harbor Court. We had a spacious room with a king. We could not get a view room though the staff tried to find us one - they were very helpful. Decor is modern which I liked, nice Aveda toiletries. Yoga channel which, which we watched but of course, did not join in. Location is great - close to the ferry building. A tip - We had dinner at a great restaurant at the Ferry building, California Vietnamese - Slanted Door. There is also a great Mexican restaurant where we had lunch the next day.

<Content>Great hotel near Embarcadero We just returned from a weekend in San Francisco and stayed at the dog-friendly Harbor Court Hotel. It is about a block away from the Ferry Building and less than a block away from the more expensive Hotel Vitale. The staff were very friendly; guests and hotel staff were so warm with our dog. He loved the attention! The room is small but comfortable. The view was ugly; but we kept the curtains shut. The cool LCD TV was a bit far from the bed. The bathroom was tiny, with only 1 sink and hardly any counterspace but the location and staff made this hotel a great choice. We would definitely visit and recommend this hotel again!

<Content>Loved the Harbor Court We recently stayed at the Harbor Court overnight, my husband and I, plus our terrier-mix dog, Jake. Since we booked a smoking room (almost unheard of in California) we did not have a view of the bay and the Oakland bridge, but they are just right outside the hotel's back door. I would add that the smoking rooms are kept clean and do not reek.The rooms are superbly decorated, with major remodelling in progress when we visited in late February. This hotel is located right on the waterfront, in the Embarcadero area - a beautiful area. Rooms have many nice amenities, including warm color designs, flat-screen tv's, tiny, but beautifully appointed bathrooms, fluffy bathrobes, nature-sounds provided, beautifully appointed beds, and quiet rooms with windows that open.The staff is superb and efficient - very welcoming. The lobby is beautiful and very inviting, with separate seating areas, soft lighting, bookcases, fireplace...wine served in afternoons, and cookies and milk served in the evenings. Computer access is provided in the lobby as well. The hotel is centrally located to many SF locations, easy to catch a cable car or taxi. The hotel is connected to SF's YMCA, and hotel guests are able to use their extensive facilities, although we have never had the time.

THe room was tiny, but that didn't bother me given the wonderful location and the cost during peak travel time (i think it was $95/night).The wine/beer hour was great - nice wines and beers, a real effort in picking good ones. Starbucks coffee in the morning. Nice decor and very clean. Highly recommended. I'll definitely stay there next time in SF.

<Content>Great location but not much else to rave about Bay view rooms have fabulous views and the location right on the embarcadero is wonderful. Rooms are very small which is fine for a city hotel but I can imagine no view in such a small room would make for a dreary stay.No room service at all except for the local japanese restaurant...that was weird. Service was ok but a bit on the cold side. Carpets and walls need some TLC which makes things look tired and dirty. All in all a mediocre stay.

<Content>Great Hotel for the $ My fiance and I decided on a last minute Labor Day trip to San Francisco and used priceline to get a good deal on hotels. For $75 a night we got this hotel and I was skeptical (first time using priceline). It was a really nice Europen style hotel that was clean and staff very friendly. We upgraded for $25/night to a bay view room and this is totally worth it. We woke up to a beautiful sunrise over the SF bay bridge. Yes the rooms are small but we spent limited time there. The hotel also had complimentary beer/wine 5-6pm and coffee/tea till noon. They also had homemade cookies and milk in the evenings. The location is excellent if you do not have a car. We were 2 blocks from BART to get back and forth to airport ($5/person), 2 blocks from F-train to the Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf and 2 blocks to the cable cars to China Town so we could take public transportation everywhere and cab at night when we were tired. The cab fare there is pretty expensive and all car travel is slow at peak times. Overall, I was very pleased with this hotel for the price.

<Content>Great view, small room I just returned from a weekend stay at the Harbor Court and could go on and on about the location and view! The room was very small with 2 single beds (!) but the view of the Bay Bridge and Treasure Island was excellent. We walked to SBC Park for a Giants game-20 min. leisurely walk, and visited the Ferry Bldg for Farmer's market and clam chowder at the seafood restaurant there with a beautiful view of the bay bridge and wonderful man playing the clarinet outside. I highly recommend the Harbor Court Hotel unless you have several people to fit in a room. The wine/beer hour and cookies and milk in the evening was a very nice touch.

<Content>hotel is OK, some rooms are horror!!! Stayed in the Habor Court for 4 nights. Posititiv is the location of the hotel, gratis internet access in the lobby, gratis!!! wine/beer taste hours and clean rooms. Negativ,I booked via hotwire against a rate of USD80, we stayed the first three nigts in a extremely small room which is unacceptabel for everybody(especially with 2 persons, it is about 6sqm..no joke!!!!) and a shame that they putting people in such a dog corner( a real horror). We complaind and after 3 nights we're moved to another room which was small but ay least you could call it a room, means watch out for rooms ending on 01 like 501, 401 etc. Conclusion: hotel is good, but with offering some unacceptabel rooms we would never stay in this hotel again, risk would be to high to get again such room, sorry!!

There is complimentary coffee and tea in the morning, a wine tasting between 5-6 pm, and cookies and milk later in the evening.All of the staff are great, the front desk, the housekeepers, etc. The rooms are very small, bordering on tiny, but nicely decorated. I went through Priceline, so my initial room didn't have a view. For an additional cost, I was able to upgrade to a room with a view of the Bay Bridge. It was well worth it. I would definitely go back to this hotel.

<Content>Good hotel, good location. I stayed here at the end of March for the weekend. I got a great rate of $60/night on Priceline. For the price it was excellent. The location was perfect for me. It鈥檚 only a few blocks from Bart so I took Bart to the hotel from the airport. It鈥檚 right next to the gorgeous Ferry Building that has an awesome farmer鈥檚 market on weekends. Don鈥檛 miss it. It is walking distance to Union Square and I even walked to Fisherman鈥檚 Warf and the Haight from there (well I like walking).The room was pretty small, but it was fine for one person. Two people with two large suit cases would have been a little cramped. I didn鈥檛 have much of a view because I had a cheap Priceline room, but I didn鈥檛 care because I was gone all day long. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was nice. Had to wait almost 2 hours for my room to be ready but I came early and it was ready by their official check-in time. However, they didn鈥檛 seem to do much to hurry and get it made up for me since I was waiting. This was a little annoying but , oh well. I asked the front desk people if I had the smallest room and they said no, they had smaller ones. Room was relatively clean and when I asked for more towels, service was prompt. Didn鈥檛 use the YMCA, but heard it was really nice.Overall, a nice hotel with small rooms. I would stay there again especially at $60/night!

Enjoyed wine hour, which actually turned into wine hours since we asked the staff what they were going to do with the opened wine. they said we could have it, otherwise they were going to dump it. Great location. Walking distance to many great restaurants. Easy walk to the Gordon Bierch brewery.

<Content>Nice hotel, good value I stayed at the Harbor Court for two nights last month and it was very comfortable. The lobby is nicely decorated and the staff could not be more helpful from the moment you walk in the door. Other reviewers have noted, and it's true, that the rooms are on the small side. However, there is plenty of room for one or two people and, if you are lucky enough to have a Bay view room, the views are spectacular. The Harbor Court is a good value compared to many other hotels in San Francisco and does offer free wine/beer tastings in the lobby every evening. It's not the most luxurious hotel in SF, but for what I paid I would stay there again.
