<Content>hard to find, hard to leave We spent just one night as a part of our tour of Bali, but we immediately fell in love with this place. The location is certainly off the beaten track, about three hours from the international airport and about fifteen minutes uphill drive from the northern coast of Bali.Once you're there, the hotel with it's beautiful grounds is like paradise, very luxurious but maintaining a relaxed, cosy atmosphere. There are only a handful of rooms which are actually little houses. Ours had the shower and a whirlpool outside, in a lovely little private walled-garden. The room itself was spacious, clean and luxuriously appointed. The main-pool isn't huge, but very nice, with a great view.The highlight of our stay was the dinner. The cuisine was excellent and by far the best we've experienced on Bali.Altogether, the hotel offers excellent value compared to other high-end options on Bali, the drawback obviously being the location. However, there is plenty to see on the way, so you can make the most of the transfer by making sure you have plenty of time and a driver who knows the sights.I think this hotel is a perfect place to relax, read and enjoy great food.

<Content>The best place in Lovina Spent five days at Damai, each more fantastic then the previous. Some observations:- Expect to eat. The restaurant food, chef and staff are exceptional. Favorites were the morning bread basket and the tuna tartar on lemongrass stalks. We also opted to spend a day with the head chef which was a lot of fun and we learned a lot. We also took advantage of the complimentary room service often which appreciated after a long day of activity. Since Damai is rather removed from the rest of Lovina, be prepared to have most of you meals there. - Expect to plan outings. Damai is nestled up in the hills above Lovina and is not easily accessible without a vehicle. Fortunately, the Damai staff provides a full menu of interesting outings and will modify or create a trip just for you. We particularly enjoyed snorkeling Menjangan island, our trip to the market with the chef and visiting the sarong factory (the only place to buy a sarong). The hot springs were also nice but you have to run the gauntlet of merchants there and back. Our least favorite activities included a stop at Lovina beach (nothing but merchants) and the dolphin outing by traditional boat. If you've never seen a dolphin, perhaps this would appeal but the reality was very tacky as literally hundreds of boats jockey to view the same animals.- Expect quiet time. As noted, Damai is removed from Lovina so it's you, the staff and a few other guests. The bungalows provide good privacy and there's a real laid-back pace. - The spa is so-so. We spent a few hours in the spa - an open air hut close to the road and though the staff was courteous and competent, the facilities just don't match-up to similar resorts. I would advise arranging any services to happen in your room.Damai makes a great home to explore the surrounding area. Lovina itself was OK, but there was enough to see for a 3-4 day stay. The facilities and staff are fantastic, the food is beyond exceptional. Highly recommended.

<Content>Wonderful getaway! We had a great time at Damai, the staff was really nice, the location has a great view. Best part of this hotel is that its away from the touristy areas of south Bali.The chef is really creative, I recommend getting the 6-course tasting menu - but make sure you are hungry! My wife and I agreed desserts were amazing.The bartenders were the best! We asked them to get creative using some non-typical fruits for drinks they delivered each time! Great guys, great drinks.The villas are great, quiet, nice, wifi/internet included, room service 24/7. Just ask for the room away from the main office/kitchen. Some of the villa have views, others are a bit more recessed, best to ask. Make sure you book in advance. Very popular place.The staff were very personable, always helpful. Overally, we had a enjoyable stay.

<Content>Island Oasis of Calm I stayed here for the first time not long after they opened - nothing was too much trouble when we stayed there.The driver came and picked us up from the previous hotel we were in and ferried us all over the island - to Mt Agung, down to the beach etc...The place is very tranquil and the villas are just amazing with fabulous sunsets and sublime cooking.If you get the chance do one of the cooking lessons - otherwise just laze by the pool....Only drawback is that this is very much a couple location and is a little rural so need to rely on the driver - but we saw this as a real plus rather than a negative!!Having stayed in places all over the world this is still one of my favourite places to stay!!

Nice rooms, idyllic place, one of the most outstanding restaurants I've ever eaten in anywhere in the world, friendly attentive staff etc etc. We were there with our little one year old daughter Selina and she was always being entertained by the super friendly staff leaving her parents a few peaceful moments. They got wind it was my birthday during our stay there and produced a surprise cake that was large and delicious.This place deserves 6 stars and not just 5.

<Content>A Delicious Paradise! Damai Villas is truly a paradise with exceptional organic food (included BREAKFAST!!, the tuna sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, the lamb...) and some of the best super fresh cocktails I have ever had in my life and I still think about all the exotic fruit!The rooms are luxurious with an atentive and kind staff, the pool area and bar is well taken care of and the spa is a dream! I loved my intelligent masseuse, once I had a massage, I booked other treatments, we became buddies and she told me all about Bali! I honestly could have stayed there a month! EVERYTHING WAS PERFECTION! The dolphin tour was great for the sunrise and the I recommend the packages- WORTH IT!

<Content>Fantastic hidden gem .... Overall, the trip exceeded our expectations. Upon our late night arrival a driver picked us up at the airport and drove us to the resort. When we arrived at the resort, Nils the owner greeted our arrival and joined us for a snack of gourmet tuna sandwiches and mojiteas (a house speciality). We then retired to our lovely bungalow complete with an outdoor shower and private jacuzzi. We woke up the next day to paradise. The entire resort has an zen-like energy about it. From the smell of fresh morning dew to the soft sounds of a Balinese flute. All in all, the highlight of the trip was hands-down the staff and the food. The staff at Damai Lovina provided personalized attention to our every need from arranging snorkeling trips to a chauffeur driven tour of northern Bali. Plus, they were just super-warm and friendly.We had most of our meals at the rooftop restaurant which has a 360 degree panoramic view of the surrounding area. It was nothing less than spectacular! Although we were miles away from the hustle and bustle any major city, the food was 5-star gourmet quality. From the tuna tartar, to the special Damai bouillabaisse to the delicious pineapple tart. I also had a few spa treatments in their outdoor spa. I started all my treatments with a foot bath of regional Balinese flowers. When I closed my eyes, I felt my stress just melt away. I felt so far away from the crowds, noise and pollution of my every day city life. Our trip was so amazing that we decided to get married at Damai Lovina. More details to come....

<Content>The view only surpassed by the friendly service If you want a small luxury villa with a great view, away from the clutter of South Bali, try this location. While I've found service in Bali to be the friendliest anywhere, the staff at Damai are a level beyond other places in Bali. We went for lunch, massage and a swim more than 15 months apart, and the staff remembered us and treated us like family. We have real family nearby, so we didn't stay overnight, but we viewed the villas, and they are very nice. The food is excellent: a mix of European and Balinese, but at a higher standard than other places we've visited in Lovina. The pool is small but looks down from the mountainside to the sea with a stunning view. The open air spa has the same great view. They can only take two people at a time for massage, so you'll have to reserve in advance. Be aware that they have only 9 villas now, but another 5 or 6 are under construction, so there may be some construction noise until those are complete. The trip down the mountain to the beach, restaurants, and other hotels in Lovina is about ten minutes by car. Lovina is filled with hotels that have rooms for $25-$60 per night. Damai is more expensive, but if you can afford it, the standard at Damai is much higher. Getting away from all the strip malls, billboards, and traffic of South Bali has its price - the road over the mountain to Singaraja is winding and narrow, and will take about 3 hours from the airport. But once you're there, Damai is a great choice for a luxury villa, the highest quality service, and good food.

<Content>Absolutely Lovely!!! This place is truly heaven - the atmosphere was stunning, and the people were so amazing. We stayed there from 3rd to 5th Feb and we had wonderful memories. Their service was so sincere and personal that you can't help smiling remembering them. Damai is located nicely on the hill. We had fantastic views overlooking the sea below. Their meal was fantastic! Never had I tasted such beautiful, creative and tasty food before. I would give them 10 stars! Well done and keep up the good work!! The boss of Damai should look after the employees, you have the bestest workers I ever seen before - from the cleaners to the service staff to the Supervisor and contract workers working on the construction site! Absolutely fabulous!!!

<Content>Beautiful retreat in Northern Bali My husband and I had a lovely stay at Damai Lovina resort and would hightly recommend it to those looking for peace and quiet away from it all. Since there is really not much to do around Lovina I would recommend to stay 3-4 days maximum. Pros:Small, cosy but with all the modern amenities, including wireless internet throughout the resort. Excellent attention to details and perfect service. Good food for the most part but a bit expensive. Great cocktails. Quiet. Nice views. Wonderful dolphin watching on early morning excursion.Cons:Below average massage and yoga classes. No Balinese food on the restaurant menu, however after requesting we were offered a special multi course Balinese dinner which was wonderful but expensive. Long 3 hour ride from the airport.

<Content>Didn't want to leave Damai Lovina My husband and I spent the second week of our 2 week honeymoon to Bali at Damai Lovina. Spent the first week in a villa in Seminyak (Bali Asri, which was lovely too). Drive north was hair-raising but worth it. Room was beyond lovely. Only tiny problem was I couldn't get the spa thermostat figured out. Asked management to show me how to work it and didn't get a great explanation. But that was only a minor inconvenience. Loved the pool, the bar, the views. On our last night we had dinner in private dining pavilon, so breath-taking and memorable. Loved the restaurant (though we did go into town a lot for local fare). Only restaurant comment would be to stick to cocktails. Humidity is brutal and the wine doesn't hold up well. Breakfast was perfect way to start the day. Hotel arranged snorkel trip for us and took care of everything we could possibly need or want during our stay. Would go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Service redefined! My husband and I stayed at Damai for 2 days and one night during our honeymoon in July 2007. We chose to spend one night in Lovina, knowing well that it is the place to do nothing. The Damai did not disappoint us, and spoilt us rotten with their exemplary service.The Damai is located far from civilization, perched on top of hill, with beautiful vistas overlooking lush green valleys. The lulling view of the indian ocean beyond the hills is a treat. (please note that the ocean views are not dramatic, as the ocean is quite far away).Other reviewers have described the place pretty well. Let me start with a few instances, substantiating everyone's reviews.When we were waiting in the lobby to sign up, we were offered a refreshing drink. We just confirmed with the wait staff if there was any alcohol in the drink. The waiter asked us if we did not drink and we confirmed. For the entire length of our stay, not once were we offered an alcohol menu by any of the wait staff. The first time we went to the restaurant, I had casually mentioned that I was vegetarian. I never needed to mention that to anyone again, and was always given the vegetarian menu to choose from. The sambal spice paste, which usually comes with shrimp paste, was even specially prepared for me without the shrimp!They have a free shuttle to Lovina. Every time you return back to hotel from town, the manager is running outside to greet you and making sure you had a good time. The one time we decided to eat dinner outside and returned back, they knew that we had not eaten in the hotel and made sure that we had dinner. The room is quietly and quickly cleaned when you are out of dinner, with the bed made for the night. The coordination with which they work with each other to understand each and every guest is simply astounding.The food! I heard this is one of the best restaurants in south east asia. The food tastes great. Even better is the way it is arranged on your plate. Its so beautiful that you actually end up making an effort to eat so that you dont spoil the beauty. The hotel is expensive. Everything is charged in US dollars. Sometimes, you do end up spending as though you were in the US. You doubt you are in Indonesia. However, we highly recommend splurging in Damai for a day or two at least! Service of this kind needs to be experienced.

<Content>Loved Damai... Paradise in north Bali My husband and I are currently staying in Damai. (We came here on July 2nd and will be leaving on July 6th.) This is the last part of our Bali vacation and we are so pleased with our choice in accomodation. Damai is a wonderful place for a bit of 鈥渟plurging鈥?in Bali. Actually, for $165 USD/night [+ tax/service charge = ~ $185 USD/night], the price is very reasonable for what you get. Included with the accomodation is a fabulous breakfast [with a wide variety of choice between Continental, American or Indonesian food). The hotel has 8 detached villa-type rooms (each consisting of a bedroom with a sitting/dining area, and a washroom with an outdoor shower and jacuzzi tub). There is a spa onsite, a beautiful pool, and wireless internet access at a fee [with option to use a hotel laptop in your villa]. The hotel is also well-known in the area for its fantastic restaurant (check out photos on their webpage). Service in the restaurant is comparable to a fine dining establishment in any cosmopolitan city.The design of the villas and hotel grounds is gorgeous. It is a wonderful showcase of Balinese/Asian design (interior and exterior). The staff are fantastic 鈥?professional, hospitable and friendly. A lot of thought has been put into making sure each guest鈥檚 experience is the best (ie: fabulous welcome drink, a welcome flower arrangement, the personal note in the room, and a small library of books/videos and board games at reception). The hotel has its own organic garden (growing much of its own vegetables/fruits and herbs). Every morning, the hotel provides a rotating variety of fruit grown in Bali for guests to sample in their rooms (with complete description of the fruit and how to eat it). In the interest of complete safety, all water used in the hotel (ie: for ice, food and drink preparations and for washing vegetables/fruits/salads) come from bottled water. This is an added bonus since we鈥檝e always refrained from eating raw fruits/vegetables in Asia because of the water! Damai is located up on the mountain (with a beautiful view over the hill and of the ocean). It鈥檚 about a 5 minute drive down to Lovina (a smaller, quiet seaside village compared to Kuta/Seminyak and Ubud). The hotel provides free transport to Lovina/the beach, and also offers a variety of activities for guests (at various prices). Activities include excursions to various villages and areas of interest, as well as water activities (ie: snorkelling, diving) and sport (ie: golf, trekking) activities. With any activities arranged through the hotel, the hotel ensures guests are provided with the BEST service and are 鈥渢aken care of鈥?professionally throughout the entire experience. For example, my husband and I arranged a dolphin viewing experience in Lovina Bay on a traditional boat in the early hours of the morning (~ 6 am) today. The hotel arranged for us to have coffee and biscuits 15 minutes before our departure. We were driven down to the beach and arrangements were made for us to be on a traditional boat (owned by Damai). This would be a great place for a lovely honeymoon [or just a nice quiet opportunity to enjoy each other鈥檚 company and relax in a great environment]. Currently, the hotel is in the midst of expanding. There are 6 new villas being added (with their own private pools). They said the villas will be ready in 2008. The only thing to make note of is that all prices listed through the hotel is in USD. (Prices are comparable to North America and Europe.) I feel confident recommending this hotel to all travellers considering a high end hotel in the northern part of Bali. I鈥檓 just sad I will be leaving in 2 days. :(

<Content>Highlight of our trip! We loved Damai Lovina Villas (www.damai.com.) Damai was our honeymoon splurge at the end of our trip. If you're staying at other places during your trip, I would recommend staying here last as nothing else could possibly compare favorably! :-) It's way up on the northern coast of Bali, not really near anything, city wise. The villas were gorgeous, the pool magnificent, and the food 5 star. There are only 6 villas on the property so you eventually get to know the other people staying there. We did the dinner and dolphin package and the dophin tour was amazing! We saw a ton of them. It's expensive though, rooms, tours, and food, so be aware of that. Of all the places we stayed, Damai is the one we still talk about all the time. sigh

<Content>Paradise in them thar Hills! My wife and I stayed at the Damai for 4 nights in March of 2007 as part of our trip to Bali. The Damai was the first port of call after the 30 odd hour journey from ther UK (the 2.5 hour car transfer was 4 hours long because religious icons were being carried through the villages as part of the forthcoming Hindu New Year festival, known as the Silent Day). The road from Lovina up to the Damai makes you wonder if you'll ever arrive but when you do its simply fabulous - quiet, out of the way and beautiful - perfect for couples wanting relaxation and some peace and quiet (those thinking of going with small or rowdy children please take note). We were greeted by a number of the staff (and a very welcome cocktail) and found that we were the only residents as it was low season and hence got a free upgrade , which was nice!!! We found it strange that after the first two days, other folk arrived - we were used to having the run of the place to ourselves but as the Damai has only 8 villas at present (more on the way down in the valley) you couldn't call it crowded!!! Nils ( the owner), Richard (the manager) and the staff were excellent - attentive when required and always smiling and happy to have a chat. The Balinese people are simply fantastic - seemingly always happy and ready for any opportunity to practice their English.The accommodation and food at the Damia were fantastic and even during the Silent Day celebrations when we were allowed no light by the local religious police we dined early by low candlelight and it was very romantic.Lovina in the low season was very quiet and backpackery so we visited once and left it at that, no least because the walk is all uphill back to the Damai!!!One thing to remember is that March is the end of the rainy seasion and hence it rains most days,usually during the night. In our 2 week stay in Bali we had two full days and nights of rain.All in all we found the Damai to be picture perfect and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, though for the sake of those who want some peace and quiet I'd advise travellers with children who need entertaining that there isn't much to do except for the pool (which is fabulous - see photos) and hence it may not be their cup of tea.Next Stop - the Uma at Ubud - see our review there.

<Content>Damai Delicious I am writing this after 4 days of bliss that seemed way too short.The food was fantastic, mouthwatering works of art - local lobsters, tuna, snappers, quail in an East/west style cuisine. A bit more expensive than the rest of the island, but on a completely different level of quality - you really have to compare with the best restaurants in Europe. Also I had the best tuna sandwich I ever had.The staff was great - my wife has a food allergy and all was very careful - and the rooms were beautiful. My wife says the masseurs were very good.The hotel holds a Balinese dance class for the village kids - one day there was about 50 of them dancing away in the parking lot, the cutest sight on earth.The pool is beautiful also but not huge like I read in some of the guidebooks.The view over the North Coast is fantastic, you can see all the way to Java.Lovina is just 5 minutes away (the hotel drives you for free), nowhere near 20 minutes like the last reviewer said. Also, while we're at it, our really nice room DID have both dvd and tv.

<Content>honeymooners only!!! sorry! I have to state my case here...OK, the bungalow was lovely, there is no TV or radio or music... it is miles from the town, I mean way up top a 20 min car journey!! the restaurant is mainly western food, not the incredible local fare which was a revelation for me! better than Thai food, all the coconut  lemongrass  local herbs but at the hotel dining was a very european experience! The pool is very small  as a single traveller I found it very isolated!! The staff were delightful  I did take one of their day trips that gave me the opportunity to visit a children's dance school which was magical! But just realise this hotel is very quiet  away from everything!!! Also, I had a very average massage by the pool. The best discovery was the Puri Bagus Lovina which was right on the beach,  fab spa  restaurant. Trust me, I travel alot!

<Content>perfect! We stayed att Damai in mid december and had a great time. Included in our package was a pickup from anywhere at Bali wich was great. We only stayed at Damai for two nights with our 18 months old daughter. The food was great, the staff was great and the villa (with our own private outdoors spa) was fantastic. One of the nights we hired a babysitter through the hotel and overall we found the place very childfriendly. The hotel itself pay for a danceteatcher who teatches dance to the local children. The lessons take place in the restaurant once a week and we had the opportunity to watch one of those, it was a great experience!The hotel drives you to the beach for free so we went there one day. Although it was close to christmas we had the beach for our self. A guy who worked at the beach helped us to hire a fisherman to take us out snorkelling, it was marvellous! I truly recommend everyone to go there, its really worth the trip to get there and I will keep the place as a paradise inside....(but don麓t forget medication against motionsickness, you might need it....)

<Content>Best New Years Ever at Damai I don't usually write reviews on tripadvisor, but I felt such an obligation to after visiting Damai. We were there for three nights during our honeymoon. We stayed at four places on the island (including the Four Seasons Jimbaran) and this was by FAR our most favorite place. The intimacy, simple luxury, and attention to detail is unsurpassed. We absolutely LOVED our room, the food and the company. We spent New Years Eve at Damai and had an amazing 8 course meal with new friends we met there. I won't go on and on about the food, since everyone does, but it is really amazing. We live in the city of Chicago and are big foodies-this was some of the best food we have ever eaten. We really enjoyed getting to know the manager and his fiancee and loved the feel of the entire place. We had big plans to do things all around the North end of the island, but once we got settled at Damai we never wanted to leave. It is a truly magical and romantic place. If you have the chance to go, DO IT!

<Content>Incredible experience Our stay at Damai was much more than we had expected. We initially had booked three nights and after two nights there we decided to extend our stay for three more nights as the place was so peaceful, charming and secluded - so good to relax and get ridd off all stress - absolutely perfect for my overworked husband! All the staff was incredibly friendly, especially the maitre was outstanding with his always warm smile in his face. The GM was extremely helpful, attentive and descreet - very much what you expect from a luxurious hidden retreat. I did some wonderful spa treatments every day and my husband enjoyed playing golf at the golf course 45 min drive from Damai. Food was superb - especially the New Years Eve dinner had it all, from lobster, foie gras and an outstanding dessert... After all, we believe we have experienced something still really authentic in Bali - and all this combined with a lot of pampering luxury!

<Content>Great Resort, Great Food I stayed at the Damai for the first 6-days of my honeymoon in Bali. It was an excellent time. The villas were very nice with huge bath tub (our's had an heating problem) and very nice villa. We felt like we owned the hotel. All the staff was very nice and really friendly. They even picked us up from the airport at 1:00am because our plane was late. The best part of this resort is the food. I had the best breakfast I have ever had there, and it was free! We ate there twice and it was the best food we had in Bali. We are definetly comming back to stay for our 1-year annivercy. Good -Food-Private-Friendly Staff-QuiteBad-We had some bee's in our outdoor shower and bath tub was cold

<Content>Romantic Getaway My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Damai Villas in Lovina, Bali. Our bungalow , one of eight bungalows on the property, was fantastic. We had our own outdoor jacuzzi and tub as well as are own eating area in the room. The service was perfect. Each night they would turn down our beds and leave nightime snacks. Upon arrival you are welcomed with a drink and free 10 minute massage. The massages are fantastic. The food was some of the best cusine I have ever had and we eat out quite a bit in the states. At night they light a bonfire. We sat alongside it in a nice and cummfy beanbag next to the beautiful pool. This hotel is very intimate and I highly recommend it for a honeymoon destination. N.

<Content>A little Diamond of a hotel! This is the place you come to when there are just two of you and you want to just wind down or be a little romantic! It was the perfect starting point for our 2 week holiday in Bali earlier this month, although admittedly we wished we had stayed a little longer than 4 nights. Although it is a little far from the main tourist areas it has everything you need in order to experience the real Bali, and if you are looking for snorkeling and scuba diving this is the best side of the island as well. The food is fantastic, the service is exceptional and the bungalows are delightful! Highly recommended and will go back again!

<Content>Beautiful resort What a beautiful resort... We spent 5 nights here in June 2005 and had an excellent stay. The staff is extremely friendly and will go out of their way to make sure you are pleased. There were so many small things that together with the beautiful surroundings made our vacation complete. The staff would bring mosquito repellant to the private balconys in the evening, a print of today's menu was put in the rooms during the day, etc. When lying in our private jacuzzi at night, looking at the sky bright with stars, you just don't want to leave this gem... The food was really great and the rooms are fantastic - and since every room is an independant house you are not disturbed by noise from the room next door. Amazing view from the pool. The girls in the outdoor spa are so kind and give great massages. The spa is a bit rustic and the girls' English skills are not the best but this is way compensated by their friendly and warm personalities. I can absolutely recommend this wonderful resort - especially if you want to go somewhere peaceful and romantic.

<Content>Incredible beauty and serenity The Damai is an exceptional experience 鈥?we strongly recommend both this particular property and Bali in general. After a wonderful five night stay at the Uma in Ubud, we were picked up by a very professional and friendly Damai driver and spent three outstanding nights at the hotel. We chose the Damai on account of the praise it has received in this and other forums; we were not disappointed. The setting is picturesque and intimate, the staff is highly skilled, and the food is extraordinary. The garden baths with outdoor tubs and showers are especially nice. The hotel manager, Glenn, has done an amazing job utilizing organic and conscientious self-sustaining methods, while at the same time maintaining a magnificent level of comfort and quality. Although he is very discreet and low-key, we observed his evident love for the Balinese culture and people, and we were happy to support a business that cares about the local community. This is a hotel where one can find peace and witness the beauty of Balinese village life. - Jim and Kris, Seattle

<Content>As good as everyone says Just returned from Bali after spending a couple of weeks relaxing. My wife and I go every year and stay at the Conrad or Ritz Carlton and decided to try the other side of the island. We decided on Damai because of the reviews on this site and it did not disappoint!The service was excellent as was the food...especially the breakfast, which as some of the best fresh baked bread I'd EVER had. The accommodations were perfect and we spent a lot of time in the garden in the Jacuzzi.The only unfortunate thing...not enough people going to Bali so the place was only half full. The people staying there were lots of fun and the staff very professional.I would stay here rather than the Ritz Carlton. Much more intimate.We will definitely go back!
