<Content>The Hilton is great Stayed here two nights while attending a conference at the Hyatt, a few blocks away. No problems walking back and forth. Very friendly staff, including in the concierge lounge - able to provide great dining recommendations for all types of cuisine. The lounge is rather small, but good choices in the evening (not open for breakfast). The room was average size, but clean, including the bathroom.The only problem was that the Internet (hard wired only) did not work in my room. I had to host a Webinar that morning, so they immediately sent a maintenance person (after troubleshooting efforts on my part) who verified that it was not working. They moved me to another room in time for my Webinar and sent me a fruit/snack basket with apologies (and didn't charge for the Internet). They really took care of the problem the best ways possible!There is free wireless Internet in the lobby, along with a pay per use business center.The hotel is on the periphery of downtown, but is accessible, especially with the free downtown transit zone. If you are determined to stay at a Hilton, you should like this place. I also recommend you consider the Homewood Suites - Convention Center/Pike Street (see separate review).

<Content>Good location, small rooms. This hotel was in a convenient location in downtown Seattle, but I wasn't a fan of the set-up. I know there's not much to be done about it now, but I don't think I would choose this property again- especially for the price.First of all, you enter a rather empty area on the ground level. There was nowhere for the taxi to pull into and no awning to keep rain off. There was no doorman. Just a door at the corner of the building. You have to get on the elevators to get to the lobby and that really wasn't marked well. There's a ramp that leads to parking and a cardio center, but I don't know if I would have even noticed the elevators right away if somebody hadn't gotten off of one of them. The lobby is about 14 stories up over the parking area (I'm guessing at the amount of floors).Reception was efficient if not overly friendly. I know this sounds corny, but I kind of like the oh you're a Diamond member, welcome back spiel that I get at other Hilton properties. They did not even acknowledge that I had even stayed at a Hilton before. I really don't think they could have cared less that I was a paying guest at the time.My room was on a mid level floor and the hallway felt very cramped to me. The fixtures were older and the room itself was very, very tiny. I've actually had bigger rooms in prime areas in New York City. I ate in the restaurant at the top of the hotel. The dirty martini was excellent. The prime rib was not so great.The employee in reception did ask me if I wanted the key to the mini bar when I checked in, but forgot to give it to me. When I went back to the front desk to retrieve it, the response was oh-here. I looked around for area information in the lobby and nobody offered any assistance. It just seemed like the employees did not like working there at all. Then again, it was a Saturday night and they were at work.My main concern was the small room size- even the bathroom was super tiny. If you have more than one person traveling and need a little space you may want to look elsewhere.

<Content>overpriced Got a friends and family discount and this room was still way overpriced. The location was great for walking to various places around the city, but the room was tiny. I also have no idea why Hilton insists on making people pay for internet access, especially in a room that expensive, but they do. Not particularly impressive.

<Content>Fine Stay! Stayed at the Seattle Hilton for one night. We were celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary and were not dissappointed.We parked in the Hilton garage and took the elevator to the 14th floor (lobby) to check in. The area was very nice with an attractive lobby bar. After a short wait (2 min. or less) we were greeted in a friendly manner and checked into our room without incident. I had pre-ordered some amenities to be in our room (flowers etc.) and when we got to our room they were there as requested. The room was on the Executive level (28th floor) and had a nice view of Elliott Bay (looking toward the northwest). The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. As some prior reviewers mentioned the room itself was small but not uncomfortable. We had no complaints. As others have mentioned the executive lounge was very small but the view was nice and the attendant was very friendly. This was the only below average experience we had. All staff were very accommodating and the location of the hotel was convenient to shopping and Pikes Place market (a walk of about 1/4 mile).All-in-all we would stay here again when in Seattle. Don't believe the negative reviews. The Seattle Hilton is a nice hotel in a very good location.

<Content>Definitely, worse Hilton anywhere We arrive late at night, to find hotel had been oversold and they didn't have a room for us (despite guaranteed late arrival with credit card). They tried to put us in nearby hotels -- but none were available. So after screwing around for about an hour, they put us in a function room with fold-out bed. They assured me the next day they would move our luggage to a bedroom. But when we came back after a day of enjoying the city, and went to front desk as instructed, the clerk had no idea where our room or luggage had been located. After calling around and banging on the computer for awhile, they found a room -- and had the bellhop find our luggage and move it there. But when we got there, room was not available, so they put us in yet a third room. Screw-ups, screw-ups, screw-ups. When all finally settled, the room was extremely small. I stay in New York city regularly, and this room was even small compared to New York rooms. There were several other screw-ups during our stay. A bellhop told me he was trying hard to find a job at another hotel in town that is better run. This hotel needs better management.

<Content>Decent downtown hotel if you aren't driving Nicely in walking distance of convention center and, if you're active, the monorail and waterfront. Rooms nicely furnished with great view, but mine was very small. Ridiculously overpriced room service and minibar, but lots of local places will deliver.And don't even think of trying to park your car. $25 a day!

<Content>Recent Stay and News Regarding the Fitness Center Recently stayed at this property for 3 nights. We have no complaints about our room, which was on one of the HHonors floors, and liked the decor. Some previous reviews have mentioned that the hotel charges for in-room internet and that use of the business center is not free. Although I don't like it either, in my experience this is not unusual at all for full service hotels. The executive lounge is indeed very small, as is the fitness center. I responded to an online survey about this hotel, and mentioned both items, as well as the lack of a pool. Although my HHonors welcome letter that was handed to me upon check-in mentioned complimentary access to Gold's Gym, it turned out that the nearby location is now closed. I received a response which acknowledged the inadequate size of our executive lounge and stated that they are in the process of building a new fitness center for the hotel. It will be located on the street level, will be open 24/7, and will have Precor treadmills, elipticals, stairmasters, and strength and conditioning equipment. They anticipate opening no later than July 1st.

<Content>Better than previous reviews suggest We stayed at the downtown Hilton recently for four nights for a conference. I was apprehensive about the stay given negative reviews from other travellers. We had a very positive experience during our stay - although we did not use either the exercise facility or the business features. As per another's suggestion we requested an upper floor room with a view of Puget Sound. This was quite pleasant. The room was clean and quiet, although a little on the small side. The bathroom amenities were quite nice. We ordered room service during the stay, and the food was excellent and arrived as ordered. Additonally, the lobby bar was pleasant and understated. I'm not sure this hotel would be a good value at full rate, but discounted for the conference it served quite nicely.

<Content>Horrible Customer Service, beyond Worst Hilton, possibly worst hotel. I'm trying to keep my review within guidelines, because I feel it's important for people to know the kinds of business practices we ran into.We stayed at the Hilton for two nights, on the second night we were having our wedding reception at the top of the Hilton.All the booking went smoothly, the room was decent (exectutive sweet) and not overpriced, since we got a discount for having our reception there.The problems arrived later during our reception, and here is a short summary of things that happened.-Elevators were having issues off and on throughout the night.-Myself and several others from the reception were stuck in the lobby, and couldn't get back up to the reception due to elevators not working, and the key card we were given not working to go back up-The DJ closing the party early since only a few were at the party (no one could get back up)-Hilton Staff locking up the room, and not allowing us entrance to gather our belongs, or use the reception room for the additional hour and a half is was booked for by contract-A Hilton staff member challenging me to a fist fight, telling me to hit him, after I got aggravated and insisted he let us back up.-Having the head of security apologize for the actions of said staff member.-Finally getting back to the executive suite at least, to stay the rest of the night.-Having the police show up, because my wife assaulted the Hilton staff member who tried to fight me, be putting a hand on him and getting between the two of us, even after security had apologized to us.-After the police left, from hearing our story, an hour later (so long because the elevators were broken again) the night manager and security officer showed up to kick us out, for above mentioned assault, and we should be glad an arrest wasn't made.-After threatening to get lawyers involved for the breach of contract, being told we can stay.-Getting a call 15 minutes later from the night manager to apologize to me, and being told that we would work out some sort of discount for our trouble.-Waking up in the morning finding that we were double charged for the room, and parking for vehicles that were not ours.-Dealing with people that were at first nice, saying they would work on getting charges reversed and would call us right back.-Finding out that the Hilton made additional charges not outlined in the contract without consent-Being told that they're only willing to reverse a small portion of the charges, because the staff there says our story is false.So in the end, they breached our contract, and refused to credit us back for it. Not sure if we'll take any further action because we're already burned out from the abuse we received.

<Content>I Agree, The Worst Hilton Ever! This is the absolute worst Hilton that I have ever stayed in. We are Gold HH members, travel a lot, and this is the absolute worst Hilton in the world. We were on the last leg of a two week vacation with our 10 year old daughter that took us to Hilton properties in South Lake Tahoe CA all the way to Whistler BC. I would rate the other Hiltons as ExcellentFirst of all they charge you $9.95 a night to use the internet in your room. The free wireless internet is only available in the Executive Lounge (small converted guest room) or in the lobby. We went up to the Executive Lounge and it was comical. There were business people packed elbow to elbow on their laptops using the free internet eating and drinking their free food. What a sight! I'm sure that they could de-congest the Executive Lounge if they didn't charge for the internet!We stayed on a Hilton Honors floor, but noticed that dirty dishes and newspapers in the hall weren't picked up for the three days that we were there.The excercise room is about the size of a walk in closet and they have two treadmills and a stepper jammed in there.The only people who provided any sort of customer service were the Bellmen. Front desk personnel and management that I delt with have no customer service skills.My car was parked in the Hilton garage and my window was smashed out and my car was ransacked. Hilton Security simply left a business card on my smashed window and took the time to sweep the glass off of the ground. I discovered that Hilton Security knew that my car was broken into and let it sit there with a smashed out window for over two days! Did they notify me? NO! After a series of failures by Hilton staff I was put in touch with Seattle Hilton's Director of Security. I asked him why I wasn't notified that my car had been broken into. His response It is not our policy and it's not in the parking manual. Hilton Honors stated that the GM would contact me on Monday. Well here it is Wednesday and no response. I finally drafted a lenghty letter to Hilton Corporate HQ regarding the Seattle Hilton.

<Content>Perfect convention property Stayed here April 7 - 11. Attended a conference held in the hotel.This property is in a great location in downtown Seattle, in easy walking distance to Pike's Place Market, Pacific Place shopping, the Convention Center, and the monorail to the Space Needle. It is an older property, but the only way to guess that is due to the slightly smaller bedroom and bathroom sizes, along with the narrow corridors on the floor levels, along with the small number of rooms on each floor. All walls, tiles, linens and furnishings were clean and modern, presenting a nice decor. Bathrooms were equipped with Crabtree  Evelyn Le Source toiletries (my favorite!).Rooms start on floor 14 (which I was on) and run through floor 28, with the restaurant on the 29th floor. Three elevators provided smooth and speedy service. Another plus - to access any guest floor, and room key was required, helping make a single traveler feel safe.The meeting rooms were spacious and the hotel staff kept refreshments aplenty.Breakfast and lunch each day in the restaurant was an unexpected gourmet treat - much more elegant than normally required for informal meals. The restaurant had a spectacular view of Puget Sound and when the sky was clear, the Olympic Mountains. The view was easily seen from any seating area.The bar area also had a menu but I didn't eat there - but the bar was large with a cozy decor.The concierge was friendly and helpful. One night she made a reservation for me at Cutter's Restaurant, making sure the restaurant would provide me complimentary transportation for my return to the hotel. At the restaurant, I was given an appetizer, courtesy of the concierge. Also, I needed a 4:15am town car pick up for the airport my last day and the concierge booked me with a company, saving me $15 off the most affordable transportation I found on my own on the internet.My only disappointment was the business center - very small and a $6 fee for use. Most hotels now offer this as a complimentary service. Maybe the Seattle Hilton will change this soon. Thanks for a great four nights, I slept very well!

<Content>Not bad, given the competition I stayed here for 1 night and am HH Gold. Not sure why people complain about check-in not being ground level as there are many examples of international hotels with a similar configuration. IMO, not something to really gripe about. I actually welcome it as it means the floors start at a higher level thus further removing you from street noise. Upon walking to the ground floor entrance, the bellman was extremely pleasant and asked if it was my first time. While waiting for the elevator, he carefully explained the hotel amenities and wanted to make sure I felt comfortable. I was a little early for check-in and my room wasn't ready. No problem. I left my bags with the concierge and went looking for lunch. Upon returning, my room was ready and was given a room on the 25th floor. I noticed they called this floor the HH floor. The room itself was a decent size. The furniture is newish and there is a flat screen tv, although I consider this de rigeur for the HIlton chain. I did think the comforter was a little on the thin side, but did the job. There is an in-room safe and an electric thermostat. Some of the hangers looked a little derelict but did the job. The washroom sink is separated from the toilet and bath. Both areas are quite small. One thing I did note is that the shower had excellent water pressure. As a HH Gold, I was allowed access to the 28th floor executive lounge and received a coupon for a free buffet breakfast on the top floor restaurant. There were some passes to places such as Gold's gym but I can't remember the other ones. The lounge had h'ors d'oeurves from 5-7 pm. I walked in and noted there was a single hot steamer (didn't look inside) with a decent selection of veggies. I think there was an alcohol selection. Didn't stay as I had other dinner plans. Next morning, went to the top floor restaurant for breakfast. The buffet was not the most plentiful I've seen but decently stocked. There were the standard bacon, sausage, eggs, french toast, pastries, fruit, etc. A feature I like about all Hiltons is that you can ask for made-to-order eggs as part of the buffet. I ordered an omelette and what came back was a HUGE omelette that was very good. I've had omelettes in plenty of hotels before and can vouch that this thing was big. Check-out was smooth. The whole time during my stay, there were reminders that I would be getting a survey and if I couldn't rate the hotel a 10, they encouraged me to call someone about it. Considering the Hilton is NOT a 5 star hotel (I think 4 star), it met expectations. The staff certainly did try and tried hard. I would stay here again, provided the price is right. I'm giving it 4.5 stars (but TripAdvisor won't allow that) because the HVAC was a little loud and the smallish bathroom size. The staff service is definitely 5 star.

<Content>Solid hotel Recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. No major complaints. The set up is a little odd what with having to take an elevator to the lobby from street level but nothing to stress over. Check in was smooth. We were given a room on the 23rd floor. It was just right the right size for myself and my boyfriend. Apparently this hotel has been recently renovated. It shows. The furniture in our room was in pristine condition and the widescreen LG tv's are great. The beds and bedding are also top notch. The one complaint I would have about the room would be that the bathroom area is on the small side. It is definately a one person sized area. You have to take turns getting ready.Also something that might be and issue for light sleepers who plan on sleeping in is that the hotel walls are on the thin side. Sound travels here. We woke early on both mornings to go out and could hear housekeeping knocking on doors loud and clear. I thought they were knocking on the door of the room next to ours but when I peeked out they were at least 5 doors down.We were given access to the concierge lounge on the 28th floor. It is a converted guest room and as such is not particularly spacious. The gentleman up there serving drinks is great for any kind of questions you may have about where to dine, what to see, etc. He recommended a fantastic restaurant to us and made us reservations as well. I can honestly say it was one of my top five dining experiences ever.I did not dine in the hotel restaurant or use the fitness room so I have no comment on those areas. There is a lobby bar which is fairly spacious but I never saw more than 5 guests in there at once. Not a super busy place.One final comment I would like to throw in about this hotel is that the staff we came across were all pleasant. I find this to be one of the things I judge an experience by the most. Its kind of like going to a restaurant and having wonderful food and horrid service. The food could be the best ever and you probably wouldn't go back because the service sucked. All of the service personnel we came across were friendly and courteous. Particularily the concierge in the concierge lounge. They made our stay most pleasant. I will definately be back to this hotel

<Content>Mostly excellent. I have just stayed in the Seattle Hilton for 4 nights and apart from a couple of minor issues I found it to be excellent. The concierge at the front desk was very helpful. Check in is on a different floor but there was no hassle going up there, and it was extremely fast.The rooms were very clean with large, comfortable beds and nice views, if not spectacular, and the flat screen tv is really excellent with a wide rage of channels. The bathroom is small and has a strange layout but overall it was ok. There is lots of storage space to put things.They serve a nice, and not completely overpriced, breakfast which also had fast service. I did not eat a main meal in the hotel but it is close to a lot of restaurants and two blocks away from the major shopping area.The only issue that I had with the hotel was the bathroom. The plug in the bath did not work making it impossible to take a bath if you wanted as the water just drained away.

<Content>Smallest Room I've ever been in! I've never stayed in such a small room before in my life and for the price you would think it would have been much larger. The bathroom amenities are nice, I just wished the bathroom would have been large enough for 2 people to stand in it at one time. The room is so small that 2 people can't walk between the beds and the tv at the same time. Did I mention the beds? For the price you pay you would think the beds would be much more comfortable, but they aren't! I just really don't have any positive reviews on the room, except nice bathroom amenties (if you like Crabtree and Evelyn). Even the towels weren' t that soft...Sure, the hotel is convenient to shopping and sure the bartender in the lobby (Bob) is one of the best by far, but to park in their garage you have to pay $26/night. I wasn't that impressed with the restaurant either, you will get much better drinks in the lobby bar (Bob is the bartender there). The drinks are expensive though, so you might want to drink elsewhere.The staff was nice enough, but they didn't even offer or ask if we wanted a mini-bar key. I had to go back down to get one and that was after a lady came by the room to check our mini bar. Did I mention that she softly knocked and then proceeded to walk in our room and we were not prepared for company at that moment! My husband was furious and wanted to tell the front desk about it, but I told him to just blow it off.For the money, I do NOT recommend this hotel. I think there must be much larger rooms in a hotel downtown somewhere and they surely must be nice rooms for that price. I know we will continue to search for that hotel and keep you informed when we find one.

<Content>Not worth the price at all.... We stayed here after returning from our Alaska Cruise - if you are a Hilton rewards program member - this place is not worth the points per night. The hotel lobby is on the 2nd floor, so you have to drag you bags off the street to the elevators that take you to the lobby.Our room was ok, but they have motion detection temp control in the rooms that stop seeing you when your in bed, so each night we would wake up 2-3 times as the room was hot and without any air, as soon you moved around the AC would come back on - this it the worst nights sleep that I ever had in a Hilton.We were here two night and we did not sleep much.The day before we left, I booked a private car via the bellman so we could get the airport on time. Lucky I checked with the night guy, as the day guy never did book our car to the airport.The Exec room (free food and drinks) was a small room that had been convered - not what I would expect for a Hilton property that charges $350.00 a night.Do you self a favor and stay at other Hilton property.

Room was ok for $330 - the executive lounge was a converted guest room, overly crowded and too compact. I'll go back but not happy about the premium price for an average hotel.

<Content>Good location - average rooms - Great Exec Lounge We stayed with our daughters at this downtown Hilton property for three night over the holiday weekend. We had a nice view of the bay, although some buildings got in the way. The front desk staff was very polite and helpful with me, but I did see them treat some older guests with a little disrespect. Parking was a joke at $26.00 per nite. On the positive side - the Executive Lounge, although a little cramped, offered free drinks and appetizers everynight from 5 - 9pm and the Exec Concierge was very helpful. He put together a dinner at Salty's that included a complimentary limo ride to and from the Hilton - a big win for the kids. I would stay here again on points of for business, but if it was my own money I might look around before booking it.

<Content>Great service, great hotel After reading the many negative reviews on this property, I was hesitant. How long could it take to check in? Only a minute--and they have an atm style check in machine. The service: outstanding. Ask for a room facing Puget Sound on a higher floor for a view that rivals the Space Needle. The new flat screen TV was nice. The room was spotless. In short, the only thing I could confirm from reading the reviews below was that indeed the carpeting in the outside hall was a bit dated.

<Content>Good downtown Seattle hotel My family and I stayed there for three nights during a vacation stay to Seattle and Vancouver this month. At a price in the low-$200s, we thought it was good value. It's an easy walk of several blocks to the Pike Place Market and everything else downtown. (Beware, part of this walk is uphill going or coming back. Choose your poison if you're sort of out of shape.) Numerous top-shelf restuarants are nearby, including the incredible Wild Ginger, which is just a block and a half away. The rooms have a clean contemporary feel. Our rooms (we stayed there before and after going to Vancouver) were outfitted with high-def televisions, mini bars, and safes. The rooms start on the 14th floor and go up from there (the garage is below) and offered great views. The hotel's business center is open 24 hours daily, and Internet is available there for a nominal fee. The Top of the Hilton restaurant offers great views of the city. We tried the breakfast buffet one day, and it had decent, but limited standard fare (sausage, but no bacon! was my 6-year-old daughter's complaint) for the money. Some of my party ordered off the menu for breakfast and loved the food. The Top of the Hilton is also open for lunch and dinner and has a small bar, but we didn't go up there for anything but breakfast. The lobby bar and lounge is comfortable and is laid out in vignettes that feel like your living room. The staff is very, very chatty and friendly and the concierges are very knowledgeable about local restaurants and attractions. The manager personally greets people as they check in, and thanks them for their business. Very nice, genuine touch. Nice hotel, whether you're in town for business or pleasure.

<Content>Friendly, Convenient, Comfortable Hilton We stayed at the Hilton Seattle from August 18-20, 2007. What a beautiful, friendly, comfortable and well-located hotel. We were only a few short blocks from the Pike Street Market, harbor front restaurants and shops and even closer to the high-end shopping district (5th and 6th Avenues) with Nordstroms, Macys, Abercrombie and Fitch, Gap, etc. Our room was a King Non-Smoking. The room was larger than expected, well-furnished, and the bed was extremely comfortable.The parking garage and elevator system were convenient and fast. I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for an elevator.The hotel staff was extremely helpful, friendly, and knowledgable of hotel ammenties and the city (what not to miss in 2 days!). We were directed toward the Brooklyn restaurant for our first dinner in the city -- good choice. The Top of the Hilton was wonderful for nightcaps and breakfast - great view. As HHonors members, we also had the Executive Lounge appetizers and drinks in the early evening. All was excellent, especially the EL concierge staff.I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again on my next trip.

<Content>Not deserving of the poor reviews, nice place to stay! Yes there is some construction going on and one of the elevators was being rebuilt, but from arrival to check in and then to the room, no issues noted. Friendly employees were the norm. We visited the concierge bar upstairs and the lobby bar downstairs and had nothing but friendly, mostly efficient service. It DID take a bit for the four of us to get our bloody marys and mimosas with breakfast in the morning.I wouldn't worry about the negative comments keeping you from staying here; the hotel is centrally located, reasonably priced and is all in all a very comfortable place to stay.

<Content>Dated, musty, overpriced; rude staff The only good thing about this hotel is its location--easy walking to shopping and to the market. The hotel itself is overpriced for what you get, which is old furnishings, musty hallways, and a quite curt staff. Fortunately, after three rounds of correspondence, we received a half-stay refund as requested.

<Content>Excellent Experience at Seattle Hilton We had a massive power outage in Seattle recently due to a huge windstorm. We decided to spend one night at the Seattle Hilton and what a pleasant stay it was. Our standard room was spotless, warm, and comfortable. All of the staff we dealt with were friendly and professional, from the front desk to the housekeepers. This is a lovely property in a convenient downtown location. The only drawback was the parking garage, which has tight spaces and was full to the brim. However, we were very pleased with our stay at this hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again, or recommend it to out of town guests.

<Content>Stay Someplace Else In order to maintain my Hilton HHonors status I stayed as many weeks as I could stand before I just became too fed up. The building is old and outdated, the parking garage is a pain, the workout room a joke, service is lacking, staff are unskilled in their jobs, and nobody really seems to care. For example parking seemed to be handled differently every time I checked in, with the result that nearly every time I left the garage I had to go through the process of explaining that I was staying at the hotel and wait for someone to figure out if I had paid for parking. Billing errors occurred more than once, including a charge that showed up a week after I checked out. The most galling however was the total disinterest in making a frequent customer happy 鈥?the rooms I was given included some needing repair, some with spectacular views of a wall and puddles on a roof, two with barely functioning air conditioners, and a room designed for handicapped access that can best be described as barely functional 鈥?and they never gave me a room on, or access to, the executive floor. There are many fine hotels in Seattle, and this isn鈥檛 one of them.

<Content>Overpriced and dissapointed We recently stayed in the Hilton and as the name and reputation would suggest we treated ourselves. Unfortunately we should not have bothered, the foyer was very impressive and the staff friendly but the room was a real let down. I found the hotel overpriced and the accomodation was no better than your average $100 hotel, the bathroom needed replacing, the water came out yellow at first and really smelt!We left early in the morning as we had to catch a train to Vancouver B.C so did not have time to complain, but thought this would be a good way of letting people know not to stay here.

<Content>Luvman is full of hockey pucks I have not stayed at the Seattle Hilton, but I have worked for Hilton and Luvman's claim that he can walk into a Hilton Hotel and get the employee discount on the spot is not true. In order to get the employee discount your reservation must be made two weeks in advance and an ID card that has been signed by either HR or your department manager must be presented with a photo ID at check in. None of the Hilton properties are able to give an employee discount at check in and as a former front desk manager, I found it to be annoying when people pretended to be employees in order to try to get a discount.

<Content>The people are nice, but the hotel is tired There's really no reason to stay here, there are much better options in Seattle for the same price or less.I'm a hilton honors diamond member, so I was hoping for some sort of upgrade. The rooms are the same on every floor, so no benefits here. I was given some coupons to the bad breakfast buffet, but apparently everyone in the hotel had the same vouchers because the tiny room was packed and there were not enough tables.The decor in the rooms are very outdated. The bed was comfortable, but the shower and all other furnishings were not good. It was just a depressing room all around.It is in a good location. Hilton should just close it down and re-make the whole place, it could be a lot better. It is NOT worth the price they charge.

<Content>Gold Member treated Horribly My room was fine but as a Gold Hhonors member, I was not offered access to the executive floor at all. This was a first for me, as I have always either been on that floor or at least given access to its amenities. I was given two $5 coupons towards breakfast - one for me and one for my teenage daughter. The coupons did not list their value and my waiter (the worst I have EVER had ANYwhere) told me they were worth $10 EACH. Breakfast took FOREVER to arrive and I had no coffee refills in the hour I was there except for the one time I chased down another server. Totally ignored by our waiter, I left cash for our bill and deliberately left no tip (I normally am a 20% tipper). Found out later my credit card was charged for cost of breakfast (less the measly coupons that turned out to be worth less than the waiter indicated) and the horrible waiter kept the cash for himself!! Called and complained - nothing offered as a refund. Dining manager simply said he would speak to the waiter about charging my card when I had not signed permission on the check to do so. I travel a lot and this was a nasty experience. Felt ignored, misled, and robbed. This alone is enough that I would never return to this HIlton.

<Content>Was better than I Expected I was attending a convention in Seattle in February and chose this hotel largely for Hilton points. Having read many of the poor reviews I was a bit concerned. I need not have been. This hotel was very good. A manager could almost always be found in the lobby attending to guests. During the weekdays Hilton Honors members were all entitled to a complimentary hot buffet breakfast in a separate lounge and complimentary wine, beer and appetizers in the (very small) HiltonHonors lounge in the evening (5-9pm)! Rooms were average, but clean. The staff was amongst the friendliest I have encountered in American Hiltons. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>It's fine, with a very good location. This hotel was just fine. I have travelled extensively, and found nothing really wrong. The beds were too soft and mushy, But the rooms were not that bad. I don't see how anyone can say it is really bad, I thought it was just fine, and when I logged on to give my comments I couldn't believe what the other reviewers had said about it. It's not brand new, but fairly well kept, and you can't beat the location. We stayed 2 nights and toured the city, we parked our car in the on site garage and just walked EVERYWHERE! Never took a cab even once. Shopping, Theatre, the Finest Restaurants, it's all within walking distance of this hotel. The staff was friendly and the concierge was very helpful. The restaurant at the top of the hotel had very good food and a great view of the city and mountains. I probably wouldn't pay more than about $115.00 - $150.00 (Max) for this hotel, but for the location and savings in cab fares it was worth it. Friendly staff and convenience well outweighs the exagerated comments by the other reviewers. I live in the midwest, maybe those city slickers are just too picky. I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again anytime.

<Content>oh yes...it is THAT bad This hotel is dismal and depressing. Rooms are as outdated as previous reviews stated. They do have better linens/beds etc. on the executive floors...but what is the point when the rest of the room is so dumpy. Bathroom was a joke. The best part was the hospitality room for the executive floors. They had emptied out a room and set it up in an old guest room. Classic! Hard to figure out what the Hilton is thinking. They should just level this place and start over. Definitly wound NOT stay here again--even if it were the last available room in town.

<Content>Not THAT bad Stayed 12/05. While I admit the furnishings/carpets  draperies are way past due for updating, I found the bed very comfortable with the newer Hilton linens and pillows. It was very convenient to stay after seeing the show at the 5th Avenue Theatre. However, I wouldn't pay much more than $125/$140. If they are asking for rates more than that, I'd consider staying elsewhere. Had dinner in the lounge at Top of Hilton, good food, service.

<Content>Rooms need a major remodel I'm a Hilton Diamond member and stay almost every week at a Hilton property. The rooms at this Hilton have a very 1970's dated look and feel. The rooms are very small and are so very, very dated. This hotel really does not meet the standard of a Hilton property. Stay away from the rooms that face the freeway, lot's of noise The staff was great but you can feel their pain working with a lackluster property. The location downtown is great. This Hilton is near the major downtown department stores and some great places to eat.I would not stay here again until the rooms were remodeled and brought to upper class Hilton standards.

<Content>Worst Hilton in US I am a Hilton Hhonors Diamond VIP and stay over 60 nights a year at hilton properties. I have never been to a Hilton as bad as this one. It took 20 minutes to get an elevator from the parking to the 13th floor lobby. I was given a room on the executive floor, but right above the noisy freeway. The room furniture is from the 70's, dark woods and scratched, small 17 inch TV and the 2 small chairs were worn thin and dirty. The only clean thing in the room was the carpet, it looked newer. The air conditioner didn't work well and the room was hot and stuffy, I had to keep the windows open to get any air at all. I am writing Hilton on Monday to demand my money back, I wanted to tell the girl at check out how bad the hotel was, but I think she knew because she never asked. Do not stay here, if you are a Hilton Hhonors member and want points, try the Hampton Inn a mile away. It's not that great either, but at least you know what you are getting

<Content>No one would miss it If this hotel were to vanish, no one would miss it. This hotel is far from being a jewel of the Hilton family crown. I found it long-in-the-tooth. My room carpet had a very pronounced grease stain and the temperature was difficult to control. The room was pooly lit. Taking the elevators is a thrill ride in itself: half the time the floor number display in the elevator didn't work, or missed a digit, sometimes the elevator would rocket past my floor only to open its inner doors while still in motion to the next floor making it paticularly worrisome for someone with a small child. The interior elevator doors were scratched with grafitti. The businessman's continental breakfast was never in the same place twice making one play detective each and every morning. Sometimes the breakfast was held in the tiniest of conference rooms, sometimes next to the gym.Internet service in the room was often off-line, yet refunds were never offered - one would have to ask for them specifically.The parking garage is horrendous - caution do NOT rent a large, long vehicle you'll never make it on the U-turn required on the second floor.Chances of me staying here again: Zero.

<Content>Just okay This is an old hotel, and it is not near a beach, unlike the information given by Hilton. It is on top of a parking garage and the lobby is on the 11th floor or something. The rooms are really small. The beds are old, the breakfast is okay, but expensive. Hilton rates this a Level 5 hotel, and we had a talk with them about it. They say it is so rated due to the location. I say atmost, this is a Level 3 hotel.

<Content>I didn't actually stay here but was displeased with phone service Last month I was calling quite a few Seattle hotels to inquire about a suite for a romantic in town get away with my partner. I specifically was looking for a room with either a sunken bath tub or a jacuzzi bath. Most of the hotel personnel that I spoke with were polite and accomadating. The only really negative response I got was from the Hilton.When I called I stated my question and then the man I was speaking to listened and asked me to hold. I held for several minutes and then when he came back to the phone he seemed to forget what I wanted to know. I reiterated my request and he kinda laughed at me and said 'Oh yeah, you're the one that wants to know about the bathroom, it has a john, a tub, a sink. Do you neeed to know anything else?' I just couldn't believe this man thought it was professional to call a toilet a 'john' to a customer. How crass. I was not impressed and chose not to stay there as a result.

<Content>Pretty much okay We stayed the night before taking Victoria Clipper to BC and again at end of week before flying home. HHonors member, chose because was Hilton and seemed to be reasonably located for us. Both nights, had room on 14th (lowest hotel floor, lobby is one floor down) . Rooms quite okay but ordinary and unmemorable, neutral decor, well lighted baths, king bed, slight view of waterfront over roof. Really like the new alarm clock/radios in the Hiltons, understandable and functional.About 10:30 the first night we were wakened by a terrible noise, like an air raid siren. It seemed to be coming from inside the wall over our door. Another guest came running in his pajama bottoms! I called the desk but it stopped while I was on the phone. Said would send someone up but never did. When we inquired at desk if this had ever happened before, they were politely mystified but not too interested. Said might be the plumbing??! Or the elevator?? Well, it's a mystery.There was a lobby and bar just off the checkin area. Looked pleasant but we did not linger there. Seemed strange and isolated with lobby on high floor . Heard other people complaining in elevator that it seemed so impersonal and not bustling like a city hotel should be. We paid lowest rates available on Hilton pay-in-advance website, big city prices but no ambience. Was satisfactory for our brief overnights but would not choose it for a longer visit.

<Content>Convenient Location Older hotel centrally located in Downtown Seattle with easy acess to I-5. Room was small and the air conditioning was noisy. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Checked in late in the evening and had difficulty locating the hotel because of the absence of a street level lobby. Lobby is located above the parking floors. This made checking in somewhat inconvenient, having to carry all my lugggage from my car. Porters are available at street level during the day. From the tiny rooms to the standard ceiling lobby, I just felt very cramped in this hotel. I'll consider staying at a newer hotel during my next visit.

The bed, linens, wall paper, furniture and bathroom were all really nice. We had a nice view too. And it's centrally located to so much. We reserved a room off Hotwire.com so the room was about $100.

<Content>Outdated - Perfect for your Grandma! I stayed at this hotel 23-26 December 2004.The hotel had not been updated in years, and the front desk tried putting me in a standard room even though I booked an executive room. In addition, the HHonors lounge was closed for the week, but that information wasn't advertised on Hilton's website. The best part about the hotel was the 'Top of the Hilton' restaurant and the internet access in my room was pretty good. The view from my 23rd floor room wasn't bad either. Also, the hotel's central location is pretty good, but if you want to be closer to the shopping district I would recommend the Sheraton or Westin.
