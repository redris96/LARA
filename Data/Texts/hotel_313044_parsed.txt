<Content>Good value, and not too far from anywhere This was the 2nd time i've stayed at the Open which says a lot. The location is slightly out of the mix of the main tourist sites being situated near Rockefort metro stop, but you can walk there in 10 minutes or get a tube. Its pretty quiet, the rooms are modern and clean, the staff are friendly and helpful and it didn't cost too much cash either. Only piece of advice is on car parking....the entrance is so hard to see and you need to have checked in before you can get in, so have a plan of where to park up to check-in beforehand. If you've got a car wiith you, the location actually works more.....you can get onto the Grand Via simply by turning right out the car park and going 3-4 blocks down. From there you can get anywhere East or West of the city.

<Content>A good base for exploring a great city. This is a good hotel. It's not a great hotel, but it is a good one. When you visit a city like Barcelona, you spend so little time in your hotel that all you really need is a good, clean comfortable place to stay and the HCC Open certainly foots the bill in this regard. Mrs H and I like to walk, and this is a lovely 15 - 20 minute walk to the Placa Catalunya and the start of Las Rambas. If walking doesn't suit, a taxi will cost around 5 Euro or their is a Metro stop nearby which will have you in the midst o the action within 5 minutes at the grand cost on 鈧?.30.

<Content>Decent stay Hotel is in nice location close to metro stop and Plaza Espana. Faciltiy is nice. Room is good size and bathroom is also a good size. Free wi-fi available. Did not get room requested and had to pre-pay 3 night stay. Front Desk clerk stated that this was hotel policy. Breakfast very pricey so we eat out. Lots of places to eat near hotel and reasonable. We found Barcelona the most expensive of the cities we visited in Spain. However, people are friendly. Little cava near hotel was unique you must stop bye if you stay here. A little hole in the wall. Metro very easy to use and get around city. Don't eat on the The Rambla TOO expensive try the restaurants on the side streets much better and less expensive.

<Content>Great weekend This is a great hotel for anyone wanting to stay close to the centre but in a local area which is non touristy and friendly. There were lots of good local restaurants and bars which were very reasonably priced . Staff on the reception were very welcoming and did all that could to assist us with our stay. The rooms were spotlessly clean and very comfortable. We would definetly return.  Our only problem was on the metro . As a group of women we were targetted twice by girl gangs of pickpockets. Watch out for women working in threes blocking your way when you get on the train and trying to open your handbag as you try and move out of the way. Gangs also came up behind us and attempted to cut the strap of a handbag ! We were fortunate not to have anything stolen but it was'nt good to feel that we had to be on guard all the time.

<Content>Never fails to disappoint This is the third time we have stayed in this hotel and it never fails to disappoint. It may not be in the centre of Barcelona but it is a 10-15 minute walk away from the centre. There is also 2 metro stops about 2 minutes walk from the hotel, thus making the hotel very accessible to see all of Barcelona.Would strongly recommend the metro to anyone. Trains run regularly and get you anywhere in the city much quicker than the sight seeing buses do. If using the metro there are automated ticket machines at all the stations. Would recommend that you buy a ticket for 10 journeys as it is better value for money than single trip tickets. You will be surprised how much you will hop on and off the metro.Check in was as straightforward as ever. All staff are very helpful and polite. Rooms are quite spacious for some European city hotels and are maintained to a high standard and cleaned on a daily basis.The rooms are lacking tea and coffee making facilities but with cafes and eateries near by you do not really miss this. The hotel also does not have a restaurant but there are that many eateries in Barcelona that this is not a problem.If eating out I would recommend that you eat away from las ramblas as this is much cheaper. There are many good places but my personal recommendation would be to eat at the maremagnum. There is an exceptional italian restaurant called Gino's. I have never been able to fault the quality of their food or the service. There is also a good all you can eat buffet at the maremagnum also.For those looking to relax, I would recommend a trip to the beach at barceloneta. If you want to go to some of the main attractions such as Gaudi's house I recommend you get there early as queues can be long.Another tip would be if you want to go to see the fountains in the evening I recommend you are there for about 9pm as this seems to be when the main show starts. All in all Barcelona is a city that never disappoints and neither does this hotel.

<Content>Adequate accomodation for a mini-break We have just returned from a weekend break, staying at this hotel. We being 1 adult and a teenager. The hotel staff are friendly and accomodating, the rooms were comfortable and very clean and the location is perfect for touring the city.We became very familiar with the workings of the Metro and this hotel is in a location that is accessible to all of the major sights, whether you want to walk or ride.Booked room only, and never realised how much I would miss the 'luxury' of tea and coffe making facilites in the room. After a long day out, the restaurant was closed and the room service menu very limited. The nearest cafes have not quite caught up with the 'Starbucks' take-away culture so be prepared to navigate your way back to your room trying not to spill a very hot coffee from an ordinary plastic cup! Breakfast in the hotel is expensive at 15 euros if not included in your booking and whilst offering quite a selection is only average.Satellite tv is provided but the only english speaking channels for those of us who can't be bothered to be bi-lingual is CNN and Eurosport.

<Content>Good hotel - need to taxi to centre though Arriving in Barcelona in the middle of a fiesta, this was the only hotel tourist information could offer us. It was a good standard with helpful staff, but a long walk from La Ramblas and waterfront. Parking was under the hotel, breakfasts were buffet style and OK.

<Content>HCC Open and Barcelona - Amazing Barcelona is a fabulous city that is a must see for all. Have been twice and loved it both times. People comment on how unsafe Barcelona is, I never felt unsafe once. Stayed at the HCC Open Hotel, I admit the accomodation wasnt that cheap but it was well worth it. The room was spacious and very clean and also had an immaculate en suite. The staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much bother. It wasnt in the main centre but with the metro five minutes from the hotel its hard to complain, its a nice walk back to the hotel at night, roughly 15 to 20 minutes at a comfotable pace. The benefits of not staying right in the centre is the opportunity to explore the quite resturants and bars which are also much cheaper and the people extremely friendly. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and anyone who wishes to travel to Barcelona. I would also recommend Barcelona as one of the cities that you cannot miss out on. Its absolutely beautiful!

<Content>Perfectly fit for the purpose We stayed at this hotel last weekend and would recommend it to anyone. It is a clean and modern hotel with helpful staff and reasonably priced (E110), there is a metro stop about a two minute walk away and the Rambla is about a 15 walk away.We didnt use the bar as it looked a bit soulless but there were enough in the neighbourhood for it not to make a difference. The magic fountain at Placa Espanya is a 10 minute walk away.

<Content>Not great Maybe we were unlucky, but our experience of this hotel wasn't great. On check-in, the girl was indifferent and took literally 10 mins to check us in. She kept answering the phone instead of checking us in.The room was fine, except the bath and shower tap didn't work- you had to run a bath at the same time as having a shower! We left a fault card filled in, but nothing happened.The breakfast is served from 7-11am, which is good, but it was no better than basic. The croissants weren't fresh and the toaster took forever. It did amuse us watching people wait for toast though! One guest asked for soft boiled eggs, which should have been available according to the menu- but the grumpy waitress clearly couldn't be bothered and just said no!The location is good- about 5 mins from the metro- just two stops and a few mins to Las Ramblas. Or you can walk it in about 20mins.In summary- the Open Hotel is ok, but that is about it, we've stayed in nicer hotels for a similar price. I wouldn't go back.

<Content>Good Choice Clean, tidy, quiet hotel with helpful staff. Our triple room was spacious, clean and quiet.Breakfast is served until 11am which is very handy if you have a few late nights!The location is good, just a few minutes walk from metro red line, 5 minutes by taxi or 20-30 minutes walk to town (Ramblas, gothic quarter, loads of shops, bars and restaurants).No hesitation in recommending it.

<Content>City Break Stay We celebrated my husbands 50th birthday in this fabulous city! The hotel lived up to its expectations - the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and the linen immaculate. The air conditioning was efficient and the breakfast was excellent. We requested extra pillows and within 5 minutes our request was granted.The only down side was the distance from the Ramblas - it was a fairly long walk but taxis are fairly reasonable. However, Barcelona FC was only a very short distance and was the highlight of our stay!!!!We picked the weekend of the festival of St John (we didn't know at the time of the booking) and the fireworks continued until about 5 am!! We would definitely recommend this friendly hotel to anyone wanting a long weekend in Barcelona.

<Content>Hum Drum Hubbub with a Hike Stayed here with a friend, in the last month for a long weekend. Room was on 7th floor, fine and functional, the bar was a morgue thoughout our stay, and as it was simply a counter ajoining the eating area, it didn't really feel like a bar. So.. this meant the hotel was simply a bed and shower to us. It was quite a hike from the hotel to Las Ramblas; the Gothic area; or the more old-city part of town that I imagine most tourist would want to visit. It is about 70m from the main thoroughfare and 300m from the metro though, which eases the pain somewhat.As a hotel it seemed to have very little character , and the communal areas were anonymous and small. A satisfactory , though forgetable hotel, and if you really want the hotel to be part of the holiday experience, then try elsewhere.

<Content>Great base to discover Barcelona First visit to Barcelona and this hotel suited our needs perfectly. Chose to stay here since feedback from friends and family was that the city centre tourist areas (Las Ramblas etc) would be loud well into the wee small hours. Getting to and from hotel was simple 鈥?we took airport bus (Aerobus) to Plaza Espana 鈥?hotel is a 10 minute walk away.Modern hotel, friendly staff, clean spacious rooms 鈥?pictures on the internet are exactly what we got (not always the case!). Beds are comfortable, air-con is efficient, rooms are double glazed so you鈥檒l get a good night's sleep! Booked through Lastminute.com Special Offer and paid 拢294.00 for 4 nights. Emailed request for high floor to the hotel, which they allocated us. Didn鈥檛 have breakfast at the hotel 鈥?it wasn鈥檛 included in our rate and at 14 Euros per person, it seemed a bit expensive for what was on offer; we did, however, get a free glass of Cava (although the bar area where you claim it from is dead!) There鈥檚 plenty of small caf茅s and great cake shops in the vicinity which offer much better value for money. Hotel is about a 10 鈥?15 minute walk to the University then a further 5 minutes or so to the Plaza Catalunya and the start of the Ramblas. It鈥檚 a nice walk along tree lined boulevards with lots of interesting buildings en route. There鈥檚 also the Rocafort Metro Station just round the corner for the hotel 鈥?the metro system is really simple to use (just make sure you go through the right side of the ticket barrier!)The only 'negative observation' (and not a problem) was the lack of restaurants in the local area - plenty of small bars with tapas etc, but nothing really serving anything more substantial. There's a Mediterranean Restaurant across the road which serves traditional meals - ideal of pig's trotters are your cup of tea... I would stay here again.

<Content>Nice Modern Hotel in decent location This hotel is very new so the facilities are quite complete. Lobby area looks modern and efficient, albeit nothing fancy. The room was decent, although mine in particular had a stuffy smell when I first entered, it probably hadn't been used in a long while. No worries though, open the window and the smell was gone the next morning. At least not every room was like that, as my colleague's room was fine. Free high speed internet in the room, which is GREAT. Have to give kudos for every hotel that provide this service free of charge as it is becoming one of the necessities in our daily life, and so many hotels out there still charge you a rip-off amount for it. Here you just have to borrow their Ethernet cable and you're all set to go. Location is very nice, Barcelona is not that big and you can walk to La Ramblas in about 20 min. Of course you can take the subway too which is near the hotel. Nice shops and restaurants in the nearby area although it is not the commercial touristy zone. Think I prefer this to being right in the centre as this feels more neighbourhoody but still convenient. Overall, a good choice that is reasonably priced. No complaints here. So if you are looking for something non-fancy and no frills but convenient and comfortable then go for it.

<Content>A very good hotel I really like the location of this hotel - we took the bus from the airport and it stops about 2 blocks from the hotel. Close to the subway and an easy walk to the center (about 10 - 15 min). It is in a very safe neigborhood. Check-in was a bit slow but it was during a busy time and the staff was courteous. Did not try the breakfast as it was too expensive. There is a cafe right across the street, which we went for breakfast. The room size is good, very clean. The best thing about this hotel is that it i right next to a health food store that sells all sorts of gluten free product (important to me since I have celiac disease). There are cafes, convenience stores nearby. Definitely would stay here again if I visit Barcelona again.

<Content>Great hotel no problems with the location I stayed at the HCC Open with my parents (senior citizens) and had a great stay. Ten minutes after we arrived at Barcelona Estacion del Norte bus station, my mother's handbag with ALL her documents got stolen (side note: beware of the rampant theft problems in Barcelona and keep your stuff in a money belt or other secure location..). After a long couple of hours spent at the police station and then scouring the station trying to locate the purse possibly discarded after the cash was taken out, the HCC Open was a nice place to come and take a breather. The staff at the front desk (who spoke great English) were pretty helpful with the whole situation. We got a triple room with 2 double beds for a great price. The room was clean and when we had problems with our TV, the staff immediately sent someone up to fix it. The restaurant food is reasonably priced and decent, and there is internet connectivity (though it will cost you 3.50 for 15 minutes). In terms of location, the HCC is a little bit away from Las Ramblas and on a Sunday/late nights there isn't much open near the hotel by way of restaurants or shops. However, the Rocafort metro stop is a stone's throw away from the hotel and you can basically get anywhere more interesting within 5-10 minutes. I've stayed in Las Ramblas during a previous visit to Barcelona and found it to get a bit noisy/rowdy during the weekends and thus decided to try something a little out of the city for my parents to get a good nights' sleep. I think it was a wise decision!All in all, this is a great hotel and unless you're particular about staying in the centre of things, I would recommed it without any hesitation!

<Content>An absolulte bargain We booked this hotel two days in advance as we were staying on the coast in Salou and fancied a night in Barcelona. And what a bargain - 拢52 for an extremely clean, bright, spacious and well ventilated room.The location is good too especially given the price - a stone's throw from the Gran Via and around 20 mins walk from Las Ramblas. It's also right next to a couple of Metro stations if you don't fancy the walk.Don't be put off by the 3 star rating - this is more like a 4 star but without the facilities such as swimming pool etc.Would definitley stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Top Quality ! Due to the reasonable price paid and good location of HCC Hotel Open I wasn't expecting great things. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel's cleanliness and staff friendliness. Even though located on a main road the rooms were quiet due to excellent soundproofing and the beds were super comfortable. Breakfast is great here and you are only a twenty minute walk from Gaudi's masterpiece La Pegreda and Las Ramblas. With taxis being plentiful and cheap you can get as far afield as Nou Camp for under 10 Euros. Nearby there are several great little bars and restaurants including a Must See bogeda bar right across the street from the hotel. The only small flaw is the terrible satelitte TV channels provided which only offers visitors local channels, the boredom of CNN or the sports nobody else wants to show channel Eurosport. This aside Open is a great little hotel which I highly recommend.

<Content>clean but noisy This hotel was OK, but one thing that really bothered me, was the noise. We had our room wright next to a brick wall, and obviously there was apartments right next to it, on the opposite side, so every evening you could here their living and noises of the kids to play even at 02.00 am! And it didn麓t help to close the window, you could still hear it.Othervise, the hotel was good. It was clean, and the rooms were cleaned every day, and the towels were changed every day. There was a good variety of travelling kits in the bathroom: soaps, shampoos, a comb, and everything. The guys at the front desk were nice and very helpful. Safety box was cheap.The breakfast was very good! Croissants, bread, jam, toasts, youghurt, muesli, cereals, milk, juices, coffee, tea, fresh vegetables and fruits, drieed fruits and nuts, all kinds of cakes and pastries. You can also order a warm omelet or for example roasted bacon.The hotel is very near metro station, and there is a pharmacy in every corner! There are a lot of supermarkets that you can buy drinking water. Also there is a Spar market near, where you can buy all the usual supermarket stuff and snacks, if needed.

<Content>Good Location An average hotel not too far from the center - about 20 minutes walk to center but only a few minutes to Metro. We were asked if we wanted a quiet room and of course said yes - it couldn't have been more quiet as it looked onto a brick wall - very very close. To see the color of the sky we had to stick our heads out of the window and look up. The breakfast buffet was very expensive - 14鈧?- and from what we saw, very limited - no fresh fruit at the end of May in Spain! We decided against it as the welcome was very curt, all tables had dirty cups on them, and the food seemed very unimaginative. This said, it was clean and quiet and we had no problems. We had fun outside of the hotel and really were just there to sleep.

<Content>Great value for money hotel Our first trip to Barcelona and we weren't disappointed, especially with this hotel. It may only be a 3* but probably deserves a higher rating because of the high standard of decor and cleanliness. The fact it was a totally non-smoking property adds to the freshness and comfort of the hotel. Buffet breakfast was more than adequate and gives you a good start to the day. Metro being close by saved the 15 minute walk to and from Las Ramblas. We definitely would stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel. Would stay there again We have just returned from a weekend break in Barcelona, staying in the HCC Open and found it a very clean and smart hotel.Rooms were comfortable and quiet. My room overlooked the back of the hotel so had a good view of a wall, but other rooms in our party had a view of the street. Not that it mattered, there's too much to see in Barcelona to ponder the view from the room.Good self service breakfast, with Sausage, Bacon, Eggs and Omlettes available if you shoulde desire them. There is plenty on the buffet though to keep you fed for a long days sightseeing.Very easy to get to from the Airport. get off the Airbus at the Placa Espana and get a metro for the one stop to Rocafort (or walk as we did, its not far) Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Good value, Good location Basically this has to be one of the best 3* hotels i have stayed in. If not the best. No extra luxurys as you would expect from a 3* hotel but the rooms are clean spacious and have internet access (if you bring your own laptop that is). The bathroom is great also.The location is great also from my point of view. As the Urgell metro is a 5min walk alway and is a zitch to use. And links you to all the best places which are only 5-10mins away. Best thing to do is buy a pass for the entirety for your trip. Note: to get from the airport to the hotel either take a taxi or take a train to Sants Estacio and tehn metro to Urgell. But if first time take a taxi to save hassle.

<Content>Location OK IF you use the Metro! We stayed 3 days(2 nights) over a weekend at the end of October. The hotel room was good. clean, modern and quiet (we faced a blank wall at the back). The staff were efficient and fluent in English. We did not try the breakfast buffet preferring a cheap light meal in a cake shop (coffee/croissants/bread for less than 5 euros each.) My only doubt about returning would be location. We walked from Sants station when we arrived and this took at least 30 mins. It takes 15 mins to walk to La Rambla and whilst this does not sound much it is a pain at the beginning and end of every excursion! We walked 16 miles on Day1 and then tried the Metro. (nearest station 5 minutes) This was very easy efficient cheap and safe. I would recommend it to everyone.

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed in this hotel for 3 days in August, also I took the advise from the trip adviser to stay in this hotel, but I did not see that I was near anything, there was nothing it took us hours to reach the centre of Barcelona, and even there was not life near the hotel, but for the hotel it was nice , clean, the stuff very very friendly , the buffet was nice, but no swimming pool ,no nothing, if you want to spend good time in the hotel , you can not,you must stay out to enjoy your time, but maybe most of the hotels there are the same, not sure if I can say it if I would go another time I would choose another hotel i.e Jazz hotel which I was planning to stay there but the agent had no access to this hotel, it's exactly in the centre of Barcelona and the sea is just behind the hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, shame about the location I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights at the start of September. my room was spacious and clean with a very nice ensuite. There was a TV, a mini-bar and room service available 24 hours - if I wanted. It was a three star hotel, but really it could pass of as a four star.There are plenty of tapas bars nearby - and because they are away from the Rambla, very good value for money. Eat at a tapas bar across the road rather than the pricy and limited breakfast buffet the hotel provides.There was a major drawback, in that it was a bit of a treck way from the Centre. A good 20 minutes walk to Place de Catalunya, for example.I got a map from Octopus travel which gave the wrong street. It took me a while to find the hotel!
