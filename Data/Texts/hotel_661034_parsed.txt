<Content>Location! Location! Location! My stay at the Hotel Axial last month was delightful. I chose this hotel because my daughter鈥檚 university apartment was just steps away, but Trip Advisor reviews sealed the deal. The internet special rate allowed me a double room for the price of a single (Sweet!) for my week long stay. My room was spacious and comfortable, the bathroom sparkled, and I always felt safe. The breakfast room was cheerful with great coffee and nice choice of items, free computer/printer room was open all day, and a small coffee/wine bar was available until the front desk closed after midnight. The location was perfect; two blocks from everything, including The Duomo, which became my homing device. It was impossible to lose my way back. The train station, outdoor market, river, museums, restaurants and the best gelato in Italy, Grom, (Trust me on this!) were an easy walk from the hotel. The hotel鈥檚 staff and front desk, especially Paul, are excellent 鈥?never intrusive but always there to offer gracious assistance with a smile. When, not if, I return to Florence, I will definitely book the Hotel Axial.

<Content>Great hotel Family run hotel. Extremely clean. Rooms were well appointed. The breakfast had all types of coffee. Italian, American, French. Hot rolls, fruit, yogurts, hardboiled eggs. Our room was very quiet. Ask for one on the back side, looking into the courtyard. The location is in a very touristy area. Very convenient to everything.We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Choice for Exploring Florence If you are looking for a clean and comfortable hotel at a reasonable price , centrally located to explore Florence, then Hotel Axial is a very good choice.This hotel is literally 2 short blocks away from the Duomo. It is located on a street where no cars are generally permitted, literally 3 minutes away by foot from the magnificiant Duomo. The whole hotel is located on the second story of a building which is easy to miss if you are not looking out for it.The hotel itself is very clean. The room we stayed in was fairly large, clean and had a nice view of the main street. It also contained a mini fridge. Service at the front desk was exceptionally friendly and professional. The staff were very helpful with tips for visiting Florence and restaurant recommendations. The breakfasts were simple but fairly good. There is a reading room and a free Internet cafe which was useful. There is even a small garden in the back where you can relax. Bottled water is sold at the hotel at a very reasonable price ... no need to carry it from the store. Our only complaint was that the air conditioning in the room we stayed in was very weak and the staff unfortunately could not make it more powerful ... on very hot and humid days like the 2 nights we spent in June, it was a little uncomfortable.We booked our stay by e-mail directly with the hotel. Prior to booking I was amazed at how all of my e-mail inquiries were accurately and professionally responded to within minutes, regardless of the time of day or night. This certainly gave me the confidence that service in this establishment was of a superior quality. Note that if you pay by cash upon check-out, there is a 5% discount. Most of Florence can be visited by foot if you enjoy and are up to walking and the central location of this hotel is ideal. We found the prices in general in Florence very expensive, surprisingly more than in Rome. Overall, although I enjoyed my stay in Florence, I was a little disappointed as I found it too touristy and I much preferred Rome. My girlfirend, on the other hand, who had already visited both Rome and Florence previously, loves Florence for its charm and magic.In a city that is exceptionally expensive, the price we paid at the Hotel Axial was very reasonable. For the price, this hotel is an exceptional value and we have no hesitations whatsoever in recommending it.

<Content>In the middle of Florence Stay at Axial, 2 min from the Duomo, in the middle of the city.You can put on your walking shoes and reach everything of interest from there. Ask for a quiet room. We got a large room adjacent to an atrium in the center of the building. Continental but ok breakfast. Great value for money. English speaking and very helpful staff. Try it!

<Content>Super location, small room We had a tiiiiiiiny room. Very clean, but real small ... And a little noisy during the night, cause we had a street-view one. Nevertheless, Firenze is a great city, you have so many things to see and it's real good to be in the middle of action. The hotel location is fantastic, about 100 meters to Duomo (Santa Maria del Fiore), Baptisterium  Giotto's Campanile and 200 meters to Piazza della Signoria  Palazzo Vecchio  Ufizzi Galeries. PS. Breakfast is poor, just a few things to eat.

<Content>Perfect Location We stayed at the Axial Hotel for 3 nights in June. Letitia was most welcoming and helpful on arrival and both Letitia and Iona were most helpful during our stay.Of course, we loved Florence and this hotel was situated from where you can easily visit all parts of the city.We found a great supermarket Pegna from where we purchased the most beautifully fresh food and prepared a sumptuous meal which we enjoyed in the hotel's lovely courtyard.Florence was experiencing a heat-wave at the time we visited, and the hotel was a refuge, although the temperature in the courtyard was rather uncomfortable. The internet facilities were good, the hotel providing 2 computers and a printer. As a day trip from Florence, we visited Pisa easily by train.We would definitely recommend this hotel, especially for its great location.

<Content>Great location, good hotel The Hotel Axial is only 1/2 block from the Duomo, in the heart of the city. It is very clean and has a decent continental breakfast that includes hard boiled eggs, fruit, croissants, juice and coffee. (No cappacinno, meats or cheeses). The staff is friendly and helpful. The room is large, the tub/shower has no barrier - so be sure to direct the shower head towards the tub wall. The closet has limited space for hanging clothes (less than 2 feet). It was great having free internet access (2 computers available for use). Only complaint would be a weak A/C that didn't do a very good job in keeping the room cool - but this seemed to be the norm for Italy.

<Content>Brilliant Location We stayed for 3 nights. The location is brilliant, merely a few steps to the Duomo and Florence being so manageable on foot, it is centrally located to all the sights we went to (Ponte Vecchio, Uffizi, Accademia etc). It's only a 15 minute walk to the central train station.The hotel is clean and we can't find a fault with it although we wished the bathroom was better lit and the hot water would sometimes gradually turn icy cold in the midst of a shower. Brrrr... Your just have to point the shower head away and wait for it to turn hot again. The weather was cool and sometimes very cold at night during our stay, so we did not require air conditioning or a fan. It was cosy to snuggle up. :)The breakfast is decent considering standard European fare. They had yoghurt, fruit and boiled eggs amongst the normal bread, cereal, coffee/tea and juice. We would stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Great location! Even though the air conditioning had trouble keeping up with the 90+ degree heat, the shower worked very well, so we were able to come back to the room to cool off when needed. The staff here is friendly, welcoming and very helpful. The location can't be beaten: walk out the door and to your left is the Duomo, to your right is the Piazza della Repubblica. There are shops and restaurants in abundance, you are a short walk from the train station and all the sights. If there is room for improvement, the entry and stairway could be painted and spruced up a little. When you first come into the building off the street, you wonder what you've gotten yourself into. However, a short elevator ride or walk up the stairs and you're at Axial's pretty, cool reception.

<Content>Loved our stay at Hotel Axial My friend and I stayed at Hotel Axial last week, and we absolutely loved it! Check in and out was so efficient and helpful. The hotel is in a perfect location - between Duomo and Uffizi, so close and central. The staff was all so very pleasant all the time. The rooms were spacious and immaculately clean.Internet use is free with your stay.The breakfast is simple but complete.The rates were so fair and reasonable.The doors close at 1 am, so be sure to discuss with them if you will return after that time inadvance.We had a problem with the safe, and the owner was there promptly to reset. He was very hands-on, attentive, and friendly.Moreover, I left an item after my stay behind and the hotel staff was wonderful in making sure the situation was resolved promptly. Good news, and a big relief for me.Would recommend Hotel Axial.

<Content>Loved Florence and the hotel! I have been waiting all my life to go to Florence and see all the marvels that this city holds. Hotel Axial was the choice for us as it is right in the middle of the city centre, between Duomo and Palazzo Vecchio, where we spent most of our week visiting sites, museums and buildings, or simply shopping. The hotel is new, the people on the premises were very nice to us and gave us advice on where to go to eat or if there was something special to do. Breakfast is good, we found it appropriate for a 3 stars hotel. Rooms are nice and clean and have wi-fi internet connection, but there is also a reading room where you can access the internet through 2 computers.There is also a central court, there is no view, but we used it to chill out, reading a book or simply planning what to do for the day.I would certainly recommend the hotel, excellent position at affordable rates (for the centre of Florence).

Right in the heart of the city. Father runs the hotel, mother tends to breakfast, son and daughter man the desk...they provide a warm family atmosphere. Breakfast is diverse and plentiful (includes fresh fruit and hard boiled eggs!!!) and staff is eager to converse. I will stay in this hotel every time I go to Florence and will recommend it to all my friends.

<Content>avoid this hotel... not worth its location : ( my wife and i stayed here for three nights in may of 08... hotel axial is centrally located and only minutes from the museo accademia (where the david stands), pointe vecchio, and literally 1/2 a block from the duomo. the staff were friendly at first, but a little dense when trying to figure out the safe in our room... they had to reset it and said that it probably needed new batteries, but to let it be for the time being. well what happens 3 hours later? the batteries die... hassle after hassle with mechanical issues kept us from enjoying our stay... we understand that at only 3 stars we can't expect perfection, but here are a few warnings about hotel axial...1. like a lot of showers in europe, there was no barrier between the perimeter of the stall and the rest of the bathroom floor, so water goes EVERYWHERE. the curtain rod was ready to pull out of the wall, and there is just a drain in the floor that did not work well at all. i flooded our bathroom with my first shower. i tried to make waterbreaks with towels, but they only helped a little. the floor became so slippery that both my wife and i almost slipped and fell. the staff hassled me when i asked for more towels the next morning...2. the A/C was dismal and didn't change the temp in our room at all. it only comes on at 3pm and turns off at midnight (somewhat common in europe, but if so, the unit should work well!)3. we asked for a fan that broke after only one afternoon of use... the second fan didn't really work that well either... very uncomfortable temperatures in the room, even in may. 4. DO NOT make any phone calls from the internet room! i was told it was ok by one staff member, but that i would need to settle my phone bill from that room in the morning as she did not know how to obtain records from that phone. as i was instructed, i returned to the front desk in the morning to pay my bill, only to be literally shouted at by a woman with long dark hair who told me i was 'playing tricks on her' and that 'you americans are always sneaking around and trying to get things for free'... apparently she too did not know how to obtain records from the internet room phone, thus not knowing how much to charge. i repeatedly apologized and told her i could tell her which numbers i had called and approx. how much time i had used and that i would pay her double whatever she thought the estimate would be. she continued to literally yell at me and say that 'it is all lost! i have no idea how much! forget it!' well, what do they eventually figure out? how much i owed of course... if you want rude and incompetent service and to sleep in a puddle of your own melted self, then stay here. otherwise, seek shelter elsewhere!

<Content>Great value and location The Hotel Axial was very basic but spacious, clean, and comfortable. You can tell that it was recently renovated with a few modern amenities such as a complimentary internet lounge, wireless internet, and a larger shower.This hotel is located directly between the Duomo and the Uffizi which is a great spot in central Florence. Breakfast was average for a continental fare. The hotel's website says that it is a short walk from the train station to the hotel but it is not a short walk at all. It certainly doesn't seem like a short walk with luggage in tow. Again, a good value.

Large, clean room right in the middel of the action, helpful staff. My main complaint was that the hotel has almost no charm: extremely sterile lobby, hallways, rooms. If I had to do it again I might pick a hotel a little further away from the center on a quieter street with more ambience.

The room was surprisngly large for Europe and the hotel even offered free internet service either on a hotel computer or through wireless in your room. Staff was very friendly. So what was wrong? The room while large and comfortable was a bit generic; it could have been anywhere. Also the breakfast was disappointing and pretty minimal.Overall a very good value in a great location

<Content>Just what we wanted We have just had three sunny days in Florence staying at the excellent hotel Axial. We booked after tripadvisor research which was spot on.We travelled ba from Gatwick on planes that were pleasantly uncrowded, left on time and arrived early! Train to Florence was cheap and easy and then 10 minute walk to the hotel in time for a late lunch round the corner, the first of all the good meals we ate.The hotel is small but just perfectly situated on the main shopping street a few steps from the Duomo. As others have mentioned, the staff are really helpful. They will mark out the routes to recommended restaurants on the free map they supply. We had a bit of trouble from time to time with internet connection in the rooms but were able to sort this out which was fortunate as my husband had some business to do while we were there.We visited quite a few of the main sites including the Uffizi and Accademia and although we had prebooked entry through the florence musei website, this wasn't necessary at this time of year and we were able to enjoy the treasures at leisure.We walked everywhere and I could have done with a spare pair of trainers as your feet do get tired. On the last day we compromised and took a taxi to the piazza Michelangelo, then walked down the path on the right through the trees and back along the Arno. The view of Florence is stunning - it must be where lots of the postcard photos are taken from.There is so much to see in Florence that we knew we couldn't do it all and plan to return. We were perhaps lucky with the weather, but preferring peace to heat and crowds I would recommend this time of year and anyway this hotel.

<Content>Extremely central, but very noisy extremely central hotel, just next to the Duomo. Nice big room - much nicer than the dirty hallway. 2 computers with free internet available! Only downside: lots of noise: cars, road sweepers and pedestrians outside. A loud door bell waking us up twice at 6:30, and the bells from the Duomo around 7 and 7:30.Not recommended if you arrive by car as it is a nightmare to navigate the small central roads and parking is very expensive.

<Content>Our new base in Firenze! Our experience at the Hotel Axial in early December was wonderful! The staff was always going out of their way to be pleasant and helpful with whatever we needed. The hotel layout all on the first floor (second floor American) was ideal--a handy elevator when we needed it for the luggage but just one easy flight of stairs to get in or out the rest of the time. Our room was ready well before the usual check in time. Our spotless double room was simply furnished but had plenty of space and was full of the little details that make the vacation just that much more memorable. We looked out onto the busy Via Calzaiuoli, filled day and evening with busy Christmas shoppers but when we wanted quiet the updated windows kept out most of the noises all night. If you need NO noise at night, ask for a room on the internal courtyard. Our bed was really comfortable. The shower had great water pressure and we always had plenty of hot hot water--and full size towels. A roomy armoire with plenty of hangers, a safe and handy hooks on the wall by the entrance for overcoats. The location is central to just about anywhere you want to go--and makes it easy to pop back up to the room to drop off purchases, (this IS Florence--you must have purchases!), make a change of clothes or shoes, or even catch a quick nap before heading back out to enjoy the evening.The standard Italian breakfast was set up nicely and was always fresh, with the friendly staff available, if needed. The comfortably furnished reading room was always open, stocked with daily newspapers, travel magazines, and with free internet we could easily stay in touch with home.Thanks to the staff at Hotel Axial for a perfect stay in beautiful Firenze! Best of luck with your beautiful hotel. We'll be back (but not soon enough for us!)

<Content>Terrific Location Minutes from the Duomo We booked at the Hotel Axial after we had to cancel our reservation at Hotel Ungherese (as it was closing). I'm glad it worked-out this way as the Hotel Axial is very centrally located and we only had two days in Florence.The Hotel Axial is a 15 minute walk from the train station and is 5 minutes from the Duomo. The hotel is located on a very busy street full of shops and restaurants. The front desk staff was very helpful and accommodating. We were booked in room 6. Unfortunately, the room was right near the front desk, so it was a bit noisy. We heard people coming in late at night and then heard the staff and other people talking in the lobby area very early in the morning. Although the church bells at 7:00 am will wake you any way....Of the hotels we stayed in Italy, the Hotel Axial was the only one that had an actual breakfast room. Breakfast was help yourself and consisted of cornetto, breakfast pastry, yogurt, cheese, cereal and juice.The Hotel Axial also had a room with two computers with free Internet access. This was a great bonus if we wanted to do some research, etc.As we didn't spend as much time at the Hotel Axial, I don't have too much to say. Although the furnishings were simple and somewhat dates, the room was spacious and clean. The shower in the bathroom was large and always had plenty of hot water.The front desk recommended two restaurants Il Marione and Il Latini. Of the two, I liked Il Marione. Their ribollita was the best of all the versions I had in Florence. Their Bisteca Fiorentina was also the best bargin - the 600 g minimum for one person is more than plenty for two people to share. Il Latini was more of an experience. There will invariably be a huge crowd waiting to get in, but somehow everyone is seated and satisfied. No menus, just lots of food - meat, meat and more meat!I'd recommend the Hotel Axial to anyone looking for a very reasonablly priced (I think our room was 70 Euros per night) comfortable, centrally located hotel in Florence.

<Content>Perfect place for us! My husband and I have just returned from a visit to Florence, Italy. We stayed at this lovely little hotel. The location is perfect for getting around the city by foot. It was also convenient to stop and take a short nap before setting off again in the late afternoon.Everyone at the hotel was very helpful to us and in particular, Ione. There was nothing they could not help us with, from getting reservations for admission to the L'Accademia and the Uffizi Museum, to advising us on great places to eat, and to getting the train and bus schedules to visit other cities.The breakfast was simple but sufficient, always tasty and always plentiful. Our double room had a window to the inner courtyard. It was spacious with a comfortable bed, a desk, chairs and a small bathroom. The room was always warm enough. The floor was also warm which was most welcomed after a long day outdoors.I definitely recommend staying here and would do so again in the future.

<Content>Great Location  I stayed at the Hotel Axial in the heart of Florence in early October 2007 and recommend it very highly. The location couldn't be better, situated as it is about halfway between the Duomo and the Piazza della Signoria on the via dei Calzaiuoli, and just a few steps away from the Orsanmichele church. This makes it the ideal base for anything you want to do in Florence - sightseeing, visiting galleries, museums, etc. It's also within easy walking distance of the train and bus stations. Via dei Calzaiuoli is a busy shopping street and is only a short distance from other markets, such as the leather goods market. It's also surrounded by lots of restaurants, pizzerias and trattorias - so finding somewhere to dine out in the evening is not a problem.The hotel Axial is on the first floor of the building. The rooms are clean, comfortable and a good size, considering the hotel's location in the centre of Florence. The breakfast is good - typically continental: fresh bread rolls  croissants, cereals, coffee, tea and so on. The staff couldn't be friendlier and more helpful. The reception closes at 1a.m., which was a concern to me as I knew I wouldn't be arriving in Florence until after that. But, there was someone there to welcome me and check me in when I did finally arrive at 1.45a.m. There's also a courtyard where you can sit in the evening, as well as free internet access (very useful!). And, they will hold your luggage for you after you check out, if you want to do some last-minute shopping, or enjoy a final stroll to the Duomo, or to the Ponte Vecchio.Again, I highly recommend the Hotel Axial and its super-friendly staff for any visitor to Florence. I have been recommending it to all and sundry and will certainly be staying there again!!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Wonderful staff, clean quiet room, nice size, centralized location, great Italian breakfast. We arrived by car and did not get directions from the hotel staff, so we had a difficult time locating the hotel which was our fault. It is located on a main pedestrian walkway which we drove our car thru all the people. Scary. We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend the hotel.

<Content>I love this hotel This is the perfect place if you're looking for location, price and a clean hotel. Not to mention, they were so helpful. The girl at the desk, Oni, is about the cutest and friendliest person I've ever seen. Stay here.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff We stayed at Hotel Axial for one night and found it to be very enjoyable. On arrival we were welcomed by a very friendly receptionist and shown to a comfortable, clean room. Although the hotel was situated in a busy shopping street, our bedroom was at the back of the building next to the internal courtyard meaning that the room was very quiet. The hotel also has a small lounge for relaxing and with 2 computers with free internet access. The hotel was situated very close to the Duomo and so in a perfect location for sightseeing. Overall a good experience.

<Content>Wonderful hotel! My husband and I and another couple stayed here for 7 nights in September and it was a wonderful experience! The location is the best in Florence[1 block from Duomo and 2 blocks from the Uffizi]. The rooms [#118 and 106] were very large by European standards, and the bathroom [118]was huge. Breakfast was cereals,yogurt,croissants and rolls,fruit,cheese, coffee,tea,or chocolate and was delicious! The staff was delightful and very helpful. Our window opened onto a beautiful private courtyard and there is a lounge with free Internet and magazines and books. There is also plenty of closet space with hangers and shelves. And I loved the tile floors. It was clean and very quiet and just terrific. I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Awesome....Couldn't Ask for Anything More For the price, we could not have picked a better hotel to stay at than Hotel Axial. First thing, location is awesome. It's halfway between the Duomo and Uffizi Gallery along the main pedestrian street. It allowed for coming and going, dropping off purchased items as the day went on. My room actually overlooked the street (which gives a great perspective) but made me worry their might be too much noise. That was not the case at all. The windows must be new because they completely blocked out all sound but also opened easily to get in fresh air. The staff was very friendly, spoke English very well, and had excellent suggestions of where to eat. There were two computers available to access the internet. Something I consider to be a luxury in europe. Breakfast was included but was very basic (bread, cereal, coffee, and yogurt.) It was only to be expected since Italians don't typically eat much of a breakfast.All in all... It was a great deal. If I come back to Florence and can book for the same price, I would definitely choose Hotel Axial again.
