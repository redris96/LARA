<Content>Not horrible for downtown Miami I made a short stay at the RPHS in early Dec. Almost didn't given the many neg reviews. However, they also put the place into perspective and lowered any expectations. The place is basic, though in quite a good location. Forget what they refer to as the complimentary breakfast as it is weak coffee in a paper cup and a dried out sweet roll. The rooms are aged, though seemingly clean and the TV and a/c worked fine. Previous comments re reception staff are generally correct (they aren't much help at all), apart rom the night manager (on the desk after midnight), who was useful. Given the price (ie if well under USD 100/nite) then it's not a bad option for a sleep and short d'town Miami visit.

<Content>Not on our reccommended hotel list We have stayed at this hotel before and whilst it is far from luxurious it was ok for our 1 night pre cruise stay. So we sort of knew what to expect for another post cruise stay and the decline since our first visit is unbelievable. There is a very strange damp odour about this building. The place is dull and lifeless and the Receptionist who attended to us has got to be the most miserable in the business. The sheets were clean, as was the bathroom/wc but the curtains were hanging off the rail. We were leaving for the airport before the breakfast commenced so can't comment on that. The night receptionist was much more professional than the day one and it might be a good idea to swap them round. Only stay here if you're desperate. If we do need accommodation in downtown Miami again, it won't be here.

<Content>ehhh.. I read other reviews of this hotel, and they made me nervous about staying there. We booked it any way, mostly because it was the cheapest we could find. The hotel itself was decent. The staff was nice and they didnt bother us at all. We had to take the stairs up eleven floors beacuse the elevator wouldnt work.. go figure. Later on the elevators worked for us. The room was nice, i was very happy with it. The size was great for us. i dont think i would choose to stay there again... The area the hotel is in is terrible. GHETTO. that ruins it... and parking was either valet- $21 or parking garage- $19. we parked across the street in a parking lot for $10.. but there was no securtiy for our vehicles.

<Content>I would rather be homeless This dump was to be the back up hotel for our convention at the Hyatt. They obviously did not do a site inspection. This place was so bad that I would not even house the homeless. I would not put my worst enemy in this hotel. The first room they gave be had someone else staying in it The front desk staff was half dead with no pulse. There were cats just walking through the lobby. The room was dirty, the bedding and sheets were stained and dirty and the rooms have not been renovated since 1970. I was scared to even sleep in the place or leave any of my belongings. We were here for a convention and many of us checked out hours after we checked in with no where to go. We would have rather slept outside on the street than to have taken the risk of sleeping in that place. The evevator was broken and smelled bad. The management was horrible and did not care nor show any concerned when we complained. IF YOU VALUE YOU LIFE AND BELONGINGS DO NOT STAY AT THIS DUMP. They actually were charging $129.00 per night, I would not have given them 50 cents!. This place is so shady a hooker would not take her clients there. They must have bought the stars that someone gave them. THIS IS A DUMP IN GRAND STYLE!

<Content>Very Budget but close to the Pier We stayed at this hotel before heading on a Carnival Cruise. We only needed it for one night so we thought we would go budget. The location is very good and they have a shuttle to the pier for $5.00, the rooms are very basic but again you get what you pay for, it's a great hotel for anyone wanting to be close to shopping , restaurants and obviously anyone on a cruise out of Miami Pier. We found it very convient for local shopping and eating out.

<Content>Horribly misleading This had to be the worst place I've ever had to stay. Me and a group of friends were in the downtown area for a convention (me and four other people). Not only did they state they'd have free wifi and continental breakfast, but finding the damn place was near impossible. You have to go through another hotel parking lot to even get in the turn lane for this hotel. The price might look cheap, but they get you with valet parking ($21 per night). Parking on your own is down the road, causing you to need to walk through traffic to your car and room. The staff is distant, and rude, not at all the hospitality I expect from hotels. The valet is. . . words can't describe it. It seemed more like he wanted to get in my car and run me over rather than take it to the parking place. The front desk is a fake kind of attitude that makes it seem like you're just another check to them. Cheap, but not worth it, sleeping outside seems more inviting.

<Content>Not recommeded My daughter left her laptop comupter when we departed for the Miami port and we discovered it within 30 minutes of leaving the hotel. I called the hotel immediately and they claimed to check the room and said it wasn't there. We know that we were responsible for our belongings; however it was definately in the room and so they obviously have thieves that work there. They didn't show any sense of concern or urgency when I called.

<Content>Stay Away This was our first stay after leaving Orlando, we made the reservations and the staff member(Front Desk) was rude and had no interest whatsoever in me or my reservation there, trying to get information from her was like pulling teeth, but this was my first trip to Miami, and the hotel was downtown so I figured how bad could it be after all the price was right about 100.00 bucks, but I did listen to my instinct and made the reservation for only one night, and booked six nights at the quality Inn at the Falls, the front desk clerk there was great who took my reservation, the River Park when we pulled up looked like a dump in need of some serious renovations, not enough space to pull up to and check in while you take your luggage out of the car, no parking except next door in a office tower (Public ) garage, $21.00 a night, While riding back down in the garage elevator, I noticed a sign that said Hyatt Hotel Guest pay $5.00 a night or something like that, When we checked in at the front dest I asked if they had a similar arrangement with the garage and of course the answer was no. The Girl at the check in desk had no personality and let it be known by her attitude that she was in control, not the customer, the lobby was O.K. but the room was old and outdated, and not the cleanest room I had ever stayed in, much like the Edison Hotel in NYC, I did not feel safe in this hotel, one of only 2 hotels out of Hundreds I have stayed in that I had that feeling, anyhow to make a long story short, I could not wait for checkout the next day for our 20 minute drive to the Quality Inn hotel at the falls outside of Miami on route one, and just as expected from my initial phone conversation with Stanley at that hotel, It was going to be a great stay there, and it was. Stay away from this hotel, if you really need to be downtown stay in a well known chain for a few extra bucks, your peace of mind will be worth it.

<Content>Ugh!!! I wish to inform you of the problems encountered with the booking at the River Park Hotel  Suites. After booking on line on January 19, 2008 I phoned to confirm that the rate would be $79:00 per night and because of being allergic to cigarette smoke we would require an non-smoking room and also a room in a quieter area of the hotel. These special requests at this hotel were confirmed by the agent of the online booking company on January 22, 2008. My husband and I checked in at 3:30 P.M. but prior to signing the room agreement I noticed the invoice was for $89:00 per night. Despite seeing the print out of our confirmation from the booking agent,she refused to honour the $79:00 confirmed rate. I insisted that this rate had been posted online and also I had verbal confirmation from the booking agent Joanna, that this would be the rate we would be paying. The receptionist then went to contact the online booking agent's office. After waiting 30 minutes, she returned with a revised invoice with the $79:00 rate, but we did not realize that they had made a change and had moved us from the 6th floor to the 4th floor.When we entered room 410 there was a very strong smell of cigarette smoke. The front room and all the furniture was saturated with cigarette smoke. We quickly closed the connecting door and entered into the bed room. The smell of cigarette smoke was not as overpowering, so we opened the three windows to help air the smoke smell out of the room. After having encountered so much difficulty with the front desk, we decided to accept the room, rather than ask them to move us.  In the evening we went to close the curtains, but there were no drapes to block out the bright light from the street and the two flood lights mounted on the lower roof of the hotel just below our windows. The room had only a sheer see through curtain and it was as bright as daylight in the room at 10:00 P.M. I phoned the Front Desk and they sent the maintenance man up. He looked at the sheer curtain and how bright and glaring the light was in the room. He attempted to pull the decorative side panel across to cover the sheer curtain covering the large center window but it was impossible. He agreed that this room needed a proper curtain. He would tell the Front Desk and they would move us to another room. Unfortunately there were no other rooms available. We could be moved the next day. In desperation I went down to the Front Desk and requested they lend us two large sheets and I pinned them onto the top of the header of the valance to block out the light. We noticed they did switch off one of the flood lights that was aimed towards our window. The next morning we decided not to request a transfer, because we were afraid we would be placed into another room that was not suitable. We had encountered other problems on the first day, the guest elevator was not working, we had to use the service elevator to get to our floor. The next day maintenance came to fix the guest elevator and then it stopped working again, also the second elevator available to guests also broke down. All the guests in this fully booked hotel had to share the service elevator with housekeeping and the cleaning staff. There was a lot of congestion as guests tried to maneuver their luggage between carts loaded with linen in very narrow passage ways. I am very concerned that the River Park Hotel and Suites does not honour special request of their guests to ensure their health, safety and comfort. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to any of my friends. The Front Desk staff's lack of respect for their guests does not make for an enjoyable stay at this hotel. This hotel should not be recommended by any hotel booking agency because the River Park Hotel and Suites did not comply with the requests of their guestsI have attached photographs of the bed sheet we had to adapt to the curtain rod in order to be able to sleep during our two night stay.

<Content>Never Stay Here This is the most disgusting, incompetently run hotel I have ever visited. The place was filthy (there was a toilet in the lobby restroom that had gone uncleaned so long that the excrement in the bowl had solidified). The people who work there are rude, uncaring, unhelpful retards. The valet service is so bad we witnessed multiple people whose cars had been lost. The hotel staff recommended a shady, dishonest transportation company that ignored thequoted trip price. And none of the hotel鈥檚 phones worked for the 48 hours I was there.

<Content>Not What I Expected.... Took my son there for spring break and it was an okay stay. However, it will not be my first choice of hotels if I ever decide to visit the area again. The parking was terrible and is not $19 like the receipt and internet says; it is actually $21 and the man working the front desk became a little upset with me when I brought it to his attention. He even crossed out the original price and put the higher price after I had signed the receipt; which I told him was not good business practices. The toilet did not work; which turned out to be a nightmare for my son who has an intestinal disorder. Our room overlooked the pool and after noticing how unkept it was, we decided against a swim.The telephone did not work, so we had to go downstairs with all of questions/concerns.Even though it was not what I had expected, the rooms were very clean.

<Content>Good Hotel for Overnight Stay Before a Cruise My family booked 2 rooms for a 1 night stay before we departed on a cruise. My Brother and his family flew into Ft.Lauderdale and got a private car service down to the hotel. My family flew into Miami and took a taxi. The cab driver found the hotel with no problem. (After reading some of the other reviews, maybe you might mention to the cab drivers that it's the old Clarion downtown, next to the Hyatt.)After reading some of the other reviews, my brother and I were suspicious of what was to come during our stay. My sister in law booked the hotel directly online with them and after seeing some of the pictures and reading the negative reviews, we were seriously planning on cancelling this out and paying big bucks to book another hotel. We decided to gamble and take our chances, as we were only staying for one night. I've been in the travel business (working for airlines and as a travel agent) for more than 20 years and I've stayed at dives before, so we figured what's one night going to do?We arrived around 6:30pm and found the lobby to be filled with a group of approximately 35-50 people. By the time, our luggage was unloaded from the cab, we made our way to the lobby to check in, the group was using the 2 elevators and it took several minutes to wait. The lobby seemed nice and clean, and the front desk staff was friendly to us. We got 2 rooms, one on floor 6 and the second one was direclty above My brother's room on floor 7. Our rooms faced the River and appeared to be clean. We could not find any problems with the room. Sure it was slightly old and worn, but for the price we paid compared to some of the other Miami hotel rates that was quoted to us, again we felt that it would be fine for 1 night.The bathroom appeared clean, and the only complaint was that there were 2 sets of towels, for 3 of us staying in the room. I called to the front desk who said they would send another set up. It took a second call and we received the extra set of towels about 2 hours after checking in. The beds to me were comfortable and I had a good night's sleep. (no bed bugs, or dirty sheets or spreads).Although the Miami River Park Hotel is not a 5 star property, it's not bad for a night or two, and the room rates seemed to be reasonable for this hotel.

<Content>Great Stay I was a little worried after reading some reviews about this property but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The front desk staff was not very friendly at first but my hubby made them smile by the time we were checked in. We took the Go Shuttle to this hotel, so we didn't have to worry about a car, which was probably a good thing. There wasn't any rooms ready yet, as we were really early but they locked up our luggage and pointed us in the direction of Biscayne Bay (spelling?) and we were off. We were going to take the free people mover but we decided to walk a bit. It only took us about 10 minutes to walk there using the map the front desk gave us. Very easy. After a couple of hours at the Bay we came back to the front desk, got our luggage and they told us where our room was. A smile must go a long way ( we always say that) because they put us in a suite and it was massive and clean. I'm sure it could have used a little bit of TLC but it was nice just the same. Our window did face the street and it could get noisy but it didn't bother our sleep at all. We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was awesome and so was the service. Since we had such great service at dinner we decided to head there for breakfast and we were greeted with the total opposite service. Oh well, what can you do!

<Content>Okay, BUT... .....watch for other significant costs. There is NO place to park, forcing you to use valet parking for a cozy additional $19 overnight fee. When I handed the attendant $20, he said that he didn't have change (he didn't have a dollar???). The valet service was also fairly inefficient - basically one guy running back and forth across the street, then driving back with your car, so be prepared to wait a while if there's more than 2 or 3 people leaving at the same time. The room is a tight fit if you're there on business. No desk or table space, no internet connections. Room was reasonably clean though the outer lobbies, hallways, and elevators were somewhat decrepit. The fact that the inside chain lock on my door had been ripped from the wall was also a bit scary.

<Content>Pleasant Supprise My Wife and I stayed there for two nights ,before a cruise. We used a suttle service from Fort Lauderdale Airport. It was a little hard to find but we were given good service at the front desk and ended up with a suite on one of the upper floors. The rooms were clean, except for the windows(people had finger prints all over). They were large floor to ceiling windows with a lovely view. However the maid lent me some glass cleaner and cloths and I cleaned them myself. The shuttle to the ship went off with no problem for a small fee. It is very easy to go to Bayside Market by foot or metro, the station is right accross the street (no charge) The restaurant in the Hotel is quite nice and the food is not too bad.

<Content>Beware of Bed Bugs While this hotel is very run down, my room seemed reasonably clean and the location is good, so I was inclined to give it a decent review. However, on the last night, water started to leak from the bathroom ceiling. I was moved to another room, which turned out the be infested with bed bugs. The next day, I noticed itchy clusters of red bumps on my arms , legs, and shoulders.As someone who had never encountered bed bugs before, I am quite horrified by this experience. I am still itching and worry that I might have brought them home with me. Yuck!Needless to say, I'll carefully inspect any future hotel beds before getting under the covers. And I won't be going back to River Park ever again!

<Content>Camera Stolen Okay, so this was the second time that I was visitng this property. All I needed was a place to crash while my mom and I went shopping. But this trip started off on the wrong foot; first when I got there I asked to leave our bags since we were early for check in and no rooms were ready; so we waited and waited for the bell boy or conceirge or anybody to turn up... After waiting about 10 minutes the manager on duty finally took the bags and gave us a receipt. We went off and returned after check in to be asked Are you sure you have reservations? I had all my documentation and yet again I had to wait as the room was not yet ready. Anyways, when we finally got into the room it was not bad.. but could do with a good over hauling and airing out. Anyways, my mom and I went out the next day and when we got back we packed to leave in the morning. When we got to the airport.. the camera could not be found so we thought, maybe we packed it in the suitcase. To date it has not been found and the manager has not returned a call - I have call eight times.

<Content>Great Hotel My daughter and I stayed at the River Park Hotel for three nights pre-cruise, and absolutely loved it! It suited us completely. We had a lovely room overlooking the river, and it was huge, clean, and very comfortable. The bathroom was enormous! We loved that it was a stone's throw away from the metromover, and we could hop on anytime and go a few blocks to shopping nearby or Bayside, or connect to the Metrorail and go out to Hialeah or Dadeland. The staff were very good, and the restaurant was great, overlooking the river. There is a heated outdoor pool which is lovely. They have a shuttle to the Port which is cheap and convenient. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel, centrally located, look no further.

<Content>Not Bad. This hotel is not bad. The front desk lady was not friendly when we checked in, but she wasn't rude either. We were early when we cheked-in, so we just waited in the lobby.....half hour later we got the suite for the price of standard room. 8 days later, after our cruise, we came back to this hotel....again...too early to check-in, this time we decided to leave our luggages with the porter and went for breakfast at McDonald's. When we got back, our room was ready. The same front desk lady was there, this time she was really nice and she gave us a suite again for the price of standard.The hotel is old. Decor is outdated, bedding and towels are shabby. Don't eat at the next door restaurant, so overpriced and food is terrible. The good thing about this hotel is the location and price, especially if you stay for a cruise, it is very close from Miami port.

<Content>Avoid at all costs While there, the newspaper carried a story that Miami was ranked #1 in the rudest drivers. This ranking also applies to the front desk. These folks are uncaring and have no hospitality. They just want your money.The hotel is somewhat run down and only 1 of the 2 elevators worked. Faucets leaked and the bedding was old. The room had only 1 bar of soap, so if you wanted to shower or wash your hands at the sink you had to move the soap from place to place. No shampoo, etc. untll the following day. Several others in our group had many complaints from unmade beds to faulty shower curtains.They also stole or trashed a shoe bag I placed next to the dresser (nowhere near any trash cans) and were unconcerned when I reported it to the front desk.

<Content>Great Value Stayed here one night pre-cruise and for the price am very pleased. I had mapped it on Mapquest so had no problem finding it. The front desk agents were very friendly and asked if we needed a resevation for a shuttle the next morning, which was arranged for us. After checking in and unloading our luggage we turned in our Avis car less than a block away and walked back. Our room was a little older but very clean and one of the largest we have ever had without booking a suite.It is located very conveniently to the tram that goes to Bayside and though we did not use the pool or bar, it looked very clean and inviting.

<Content>Needs Improvement I'd say my hotel stay here was barely acceptable. As others have mentioned it is hard to find, but the main problem was the condition of the rooms and facilities, lack of in-room internet and the service.Several things were wrong with my room, the hair dryer was broken, the sink's plunger was half broken, the bathroom looked only half cleaned.On the service side I was given bad information about their facilities. They told me if I wanted to use a printer that I should go over to the hotel next door. Of course when I got there I found that you need a key card from the Hyatt. To top it off they in-fact did have a computer and printer set-up near the elevator (just meters from the front desk). The printer worked but the toner was starting to die.They have a pool which looked clean and the service was friendly though. They will arrange cabs for you and have maps. Checkout was fast. In the lobby there is free wireless internet service, but the lobby is pretty crappy.

<Content>Horrible Service! This was my first trip to Miami and I hate to say, my WORST hotel stay ever. The hotel is very hard to find. It took us over an hour to locate even though we were less than a mile away from it off the interstate. The only signs on the hotel are the Ho and Suites sign that you see light up at night and the small one you see when directly in the luggage drop off area. After we finally found the hotel we were made to pay cash for a $19 a night valet charge. Upon checking in, we were made to give a credit card, although paid in full which I was fine with. Except for the fact that without letting me know it was being done, they put a funds hold on my credit card. The rooms are very cold since they are not carpeted as well as not cleaned well. There was dirt all over the bathroom and in the corners of the bedroom. I can completely see why the rooms are so dirty since after our first night we were not even given maid service until 5pm the next day at which time we refused service since we were getting ready for dinner. When I noticed on the second day of my stay that I had a hold on my credit card the man at the desk, in his broken english, told me that I would have to speak to a manager, whom happens to always be conveniently not available. Upon check out of the hotel I was told that I could not see a manager and the hold on my card would be reversed in 2 to 3 hours. Two days later, since the hold was still on my credit card, I searched and searched for a phone number for the hotel, since if you call 411 the phone number is not listed under anything, called the hotel to again try to speak to a manager or get a corporate phone number. Come to find out the managers are only there Monday through Friday from 9-5 and they are independently owned so you can not call a corporate office for complaints or problems. The one good part of the hotel would be the bartender, he was the ONLY friendly employee.

<Content>I wouldn't go back I stayed at this hotel because I was leaving on a cruise the next day. I consider myself easy to satisfy, and this hotel did not meet my low standards. The walls must have been paper thin because we could hear people in nearby rooms talking all night. The room was nothing special. The carpets were worn and stained. When it came time for checkout we were stranded on our floor because the elevators were constantly packed with people. We literally had to ride the elevator up to get down. No joke, it took us 20 minutes to get down to the lobby. We went down for breakfast and it was horrible. There was 1 employee working and she was doing everything from cooking, to waiting on tables, to working the register. I felt bad for her, but they seriously need to hire some additional help. The food was cold and stale. They were out of cups and plates at the buffet so I had to reuse my plate. The only good things about the hotel were the location on the river (we had a nice view from our room) and the proximity to Bayside and the Port of Miami. Next time I will pay the few extra dollars to stay at a real hotel. 2 thumbs down...

<Content>Worst Hotel EVER!!!! I wouldn't let my dog stay here! The restaurant was closed, due to employee problems for one day. When it did open, the food was burned, has flies and there was no waiters to be found ANYWHERE. After having juice and coffee only, i received no bill and had no waiter, finally went outside to get my car and some lady came running after me and said that I needed to pay. I went back in and had to pay for the entire buffet. $8.95 HORRIBLE!!No internet service for 3 days, I was directed to a 800#, who apologized due to the inability to get through to someone in the hotel who could reset routers for us. And this is no surpise since it was almost impossible for me to talk to any staff in the hotel.Upon requesting to speak to the manager, I was directed to voice mail. Which was promplty ignored and never followed through on.WAIT! IT GETS WORSE!!!!!!!!The bed was 2 box springs, not a box  MATTRESS, (when I complained the security service arrived thinking I had found drugs inside the bed.) - Speaking of beds one floor had loud music, and banging on the walls,at which point I thought it might actually be a pay by the hour hotel. AND THEN, there was the matter of the valet parking, This is a $19 fee to receive parking and valet service. This part was okay, when ther was actually someone around to go get my car. If you are deparate enough to book this hotel, after reading my review, make sure you allow yourself one hour to retrieve your car from valet. Additionally, I got stuck in the elevtor for about 5 minutes one time. Which was no big deal. I was on the fourth floor and figured I would just take the stairs. In the bottom stairwell, There was discarded patio furniture (A LOT OF IT) and I am pretty sure that this is a fire hazard. Overall this hotel was terribly managed, understaffed, the employees were probably underpaid and overworked, communication was minimal at best. I actually felt sorry for the employees who do work here. As for mysle, I will never stay here again.

<Content>NO Air Conditioning, No Management Attention To It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place was very hard to find, you would never have stumbled upon it for a nights stay. We finally got in to our room after a long drive and going around the place for about an hour. You have to pay $19.00 per night for Valet parking whether you want it or not. When we got into the room i noticed it was rather warm. I fiddled with every switch on the thermostat but to no avail. Opened the windows and sweated the night in Miami. Next morning we had to get up early but around noon came back for a nap. I called the front desk and was told they would have maintenance check it outAfter dinner we came back STILL NO AIRCONDITIONING. I sweated all night and woke up every hour until about 4:00 am. At check out i asked if there would be any recompense for no Air Conditioning. I had already retrieved my vehicle. Management did not bother to come out and actually talk to me, but i was offered a free breakfast. Well if i recall, it was an overpriced continental breakfast. Basically i was offered a free jelly roll for having spent two nights in a hot Miami room with the windows open and noisy water traffic outside. Despite my lack of sleep, we did drive safely to our next location. I wrote management suggesting they do something for me, but they gave me a big fat NOTHING. A. someone either, knew it (the Air-Conditioning) was not working and gave me a bad room anyway OR management was ignorant of one of their rooms condition. Then B. when made aware, NOTHING got fixed and NO offers of a working room were made. Then finally C. when asking for some adjustment, I once again got NOTHING in from management. This used to be a Clarion resort and i guess they got smart enough to sell it off. This place has to rely on internet reservations or i doubt anyone would find it. I wrote management and suggested, make it right or i'll write which is exactly what i am doing. I will never ever consider staying here again, because apparently they just don't care. They got my money and after that i was just out of luck.

<Content>Very nice discount hotel I had some trepidation about this property based on reviews here, but it is actually quite nice. The suite is spacious, the bathroom is clean and large, and the hotel in general is as clean as the Hyatt next door. The hotel is undergoing renovation but my room does not appear to have been updated. The wireless internet is fast -- faster than the elevators.The property does have limited restaurant hours and limited services. In my mind it's worth it to save 75% over the Hyatt to attend the same conference.

<Content>big rooms The hotel is great and affordable. The rooms were super big and clean. The outside terrace area is very nice as well as right on the Miami River. Would recommend to anyone visiting miami on a budget who is there for business or would like to stay in the city as opposed to the beach.

<Content>Below average but okay I booked a suite for 113 USD, the bathroom is quite nice, the living/bedroom was spacious but worn down. The carpet was filthy, beds were good, the linen clean. Fast wireless Internet. But don't look for any instructions to help you set up your email. The windows are downright dirty, furniture heavily used. For the in-room coffee the coffee pot was missing. All electrical appliances were working. The Valet parking for 19$/day works excellent and is definitely a must. The staff is nice and friendly.For this price you have a bargain location in the middle of Miami and if you are still able to rough it a little and if you are willing to overlook some deficiencies, then this is an excellent location for you.

<Content>Happily surpirsed! I am on a budget so when looking for a hotel my choices were limited as to quality. The reviews I read for this hotel were either really bad or really good so I took a chance and booked it. I am happy to say that the hotel staff were very friendly, the room was clean and hotel is close to shopping and restaurants. The Hyatt is next door so we went there for breakfast one day. I was able to check in at 9:00 am at no extra cost as one review I read had to pay for doing the same. The first room they sent me to had someone already in it so they gave me a suite on the top floor, also at no extra cost. The front desk staff helped us in directions, what buses to take to go into South Beach and were willing to assist us in anyway they could. I would go back again anytime.

<Content>Im not suprised they lost franchise rights As I said in my title I wasn't suprised to find that this hotel can no longer be considered a Clarion. I actually stayed at this hotel on my honeymoon, but reviews of recent renovations urged me to TRY it out again. The low rates also hooked me. But there is one thing I have learned about vacations in Miami. Cheap never equals good deal it equals CRAP and that is exactly what I got the second time we stayed.My husband and myself had brought along my best girlfriend for Ultra Music Festival at Bayfront park. We resereved a room with TWO beds because obviously we weren't all gonna share a bed! When my husband told me we were on the 4th floor and the room number I was praying that we were on the river side because I knew that 4th floor would probably have a view of the roof of the lobby. I was sad to find out that not only did we have a roof view room but that they actually had us in a room with ONE DOUBLE BED. Im suprised they could even call that a room! It was a closet with a bathroom. The Double Bed hardly fit in there!My husband got orbitz on the phone immediately and whatever orbitz told them made them change our room.The next room we were given had a river view and two double beds....but it smelled like a gerbil cage! We discovered the problem upon leaving. I checked under the bed for stray socks and discovered several stains that looked like someone had a puppy in there....that explained why there had been a large phone book proping open the room's window. Im almost positive that they gave us an off market room. How nice huh?I took one chance with the pool, my friend and I ran screaming out of the pool when we found a chicken wing bone and other random trash. Sick!There was also some kind of India convention there, and the room next door to us was banging on drums well after midnight. I broke up that party as the hotel staff couldn't be bothered to.The only thing that saves the place from a terrible rating is the resturant, the location, and the apperance of the lobby and besides the smell the apperance of the room. It wasn't that bad. The Gnocci at the resturant was great and the drinks at the bar were reasonable.I'll never stay here again. The staff doesn't care about it's guests, and it seems like they aren't committed to fixing problems. I find it saddening to find that people are still complaining about the same things over a year later!

<Content>Below average I stayed here for 2 or 3 nights while attending a conference at a more expensive nearby hotel. Comments: Not cleaned well (sticky substances on desk and nightstand, piece of Oreo cookie on couch); vending machine not stocked; no tissues in room; one pillowcase stained red from something, don't know what (fixed after 1 night without my asking, but why didn't they notice the first time?); room door lock broken initially (fixed at my request). Nice big space though, desk and decent desk chair appreciated.

<Content>Much better than I thought I booked a room for 5 nights using a Swiss travel agent. Just after I booked, a friend of mine told me to look at tripadvisor.com: I saw all the bad reviews but it was too late to change because the travel agent would not reimburse me.I emailed the hotel to make sure my reservation was in their records and to ask a few questions. The answer was quick and friendly.We had no problem during our stay. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. It is not the newest room, that I have ever had but it was fine for us. Only the iron was not functionning, but it was replaced about 5 minutes after we complained.The free wireless internet access was very convenient and the price through the travel agent was very good too.

<Content>bad service, bad hotel where do i begin? the valet guy stole my hat from our car, the place stinks, the room was dark, a very scary place to stay and the elevator wasn't working most of the time. we have to take the stairs which had garbage everywhere and a stinky mattress just lying there on the ground. a run-down hotel with poor management and the staff speaking Spanish to tourists like us. hello, we're in America, speak in English!

<Content>One of the worst ever I stayed in this hotel about a year ago and it stands out in my memory as one of the worst places I have ever stayed. Some lowlights:- room was falling apart and dirty;- vending machines empty on all floors;- computers not working, so had to go next door to the Hyatt and pay a sizable fee to use their computers- dining room smelled musty;- pool had leaves and chairs in it;- was screamed at by an extremely frightening, vulgar man in the elevator, and when reported the event to the front desk, they said they knew him, and did not call the police or take any steps to make me feel better.

<Content>still a dump; avoid I made the mistake of using hotwire which placed me at the clarion. the other reviews below are spot on; from the stained furniture and smell to the elevator which is in severe disrepair. The only positive thing I can say about this place is that they have free wireless internet. I had to laugh when I arrived and the women at the front desk did not have my reservation; i was hoping that they were overbooked so that I could a refund from hotwire; to my disappointment they found a room after fifteen minutes in the back office.

<Content>NEVER AGAIN! DON'T BOOK HERE!! We arrived to find they had not reserved the correct room size, even though we booked and prepaid THREE months in advance. They didn't care and did nothing to correct the issue. Said they would 'upgrade us' but we would have to pay the difference. I let her know that an upgrade is usually free for the customer, since it was their fault. She didn't care and said she would send up a rollaway, since the beds could not accomodate us (four in my party). The rollaway never came, but when I returned home, I found that they charged me for it anyway, plus an additional $50.00 that was NOT AUTHORIZED by me. I have contacted them a few times, but still have not heard back from them. We were also promised a fridge in the room. When I called the front desk THE NEXT DAY to say that the fridge never arrived, I was told they had no more and then they HUNG UP ON ME. They are rude, unorganized and know nothing of customer service. Not to mention the rooms are FILTHY. This is not an exaggeration. DO NOT BOOK HERE.

<Content>I loved Clarion!!! Check-in: There was only one other person in line (we checked in around 9 at night) and the lady processed it fairly quickly. She was polite, and even offered to give me and a friend double beds instead of the original queen bed which i think was more expensive. Staff were friendly.The Elevator: The elevator was slow. There are two elevators for guests to use, but when i was there, the other one was broken so we always had to wait for the one elevator. When we were leaving, I saw somebody fixing the other one. The room: Initally when I went into the room, it stunk a little. But you kind of get use to it. Not sure if all the rooms were like this or not. We turned the AC full blast. It seemed to help. The beds were comfortable and big. Pillows were fluffy. There is no bedside clock for some reason so bring your watch or turn on the t.v. for the time. The room was pretty big! There is a sink outside besides the complimentary coffee maker. THey also provide you with glass cups and disposal cups. There is a working desk and a connection that allows you to have internet setup. They have a sofa. Not sure if it is a sofa bed or not. The bathroom was HUGE. They have the usual tub, sink etc. and lots of space and mirrors. Ice: Personally, i didn't get any ice but the ice machine was broken on the 11th floor i believe. I always saw people retrieving ice.Pool: The pool was outdoor. Didn't swim in it.Location: Clarion is next to the convention centre, and is located across the street from 2 different metromowovers (a free shuttle that transports you within miami downtown). Very convient location if you don't have a car. Within walking distance to bayside or you can take the free shuttle. Noise: Minimal to none. You might occassionally hear a metromowover, but it's nothing to complain of. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody. I gave them 4/5 stars because the elevator issue was sort of annoying but the rooms etc. were great! Great value for your money.

<Content>Never come back again, NEVER!!!!!!!! This is my worse lodging experience ever. I and my friends booked two rooms for the New Year vacation in Miami. First of all, the location of the hotel is not good, right at downtown, there are nothing to visit within walking distance and security is very bad around. Because we had a little bid trouble on the road driving there. We arrived at the hotel around mid-night. After we parked our car in front of the tiny area of the hotel, we went into the lobby to check-in, the black staff was very cold and unfriendly. He checked the computer, said he could only find one room reservation, and the second one was missing. But I did call them and confirmed my reservation after booking it. Then we had to book another one at a much higher price on my creditcard so we can get some sleep that night. The whole building is a mess, very thing is old and stinky. The parking valet guy was very rude and slow. They charge $18/night for that. The room is so small, it is the smallest hotel room I ever seen. The window in my room is not air tight, so it is very cold. But no heat system in the whole building, so i almost caught a cold. Never again!!!!!!!!

<Content>Absolutely the WORST customer service EVER... I encourage EVERYONE to read this review before booking a room at this hotel. The stay at this hotel started out HORRIBLY, but in the end it was okay. A friend and I had stayed in this hotel in early December for a trip that we had booked on an online booking site over three months in advance. After laughing at the bad reviews I had read on the hotel just days before the trip, we arrived to the hotel around 9:30am. The girl at the front desk was not very welcoming, and nonchalant about everything. The stay started going downhill when they told us to leave our stuff in the storage room and to come back later since check-in wasn't until 11:00am and our room wasn't ready yet. After going to the hotel restaurant to have some of the cold, disgusting complimentary breakfast (which in fact was not complimentary at all), we return to the hotel around noon to find a lobby full of different groups of people, which included angry customers at the desk complaining about the customer service. We asked if our room was ready, and the girl at the desk said that it was. About 5 minutes later, she returns to us and says that the hotel was overbooked and that they did not have a room for us; however, they were sending everyone that was expecting a room to another hotel in the area, free of charge. They gave us a choice to either wait for a room to become available after 3:00pm or go to the other hotel. When we opted to wait there for a room (since they had confirmed our reservation and room just the day before), the girl at the desk looked as if she were going to laugh in our face. After making several calls about the problem, we returned to the hotel a couple of hours later to see that the lobby was completely empty, and to find that all of a sudden, a room was available.The room wasn't bad at all. It was very clean and well-kept. The only problem was that we received one queen-sized bed when we had requested two double beds. We didn't deal with the staff too much after that, but by the looks of some customer's faces as we passed the front desk, they were also dealing with rude desk attendants and bad customer service. In fact, the only employee that practiced good customer service was the manager of the hotel. If you don't have the patience or tolerance for bad attitudes or service, I would DEFINITELY suggest paying more for a better hotel--such as the Hyatt next door.

<Content>What a nightmare This was the absolute worse experience I have ever had. Was a quest from Oct. 28-31. Was in town for meeting so I had to endure for three horrible nights. The hotel is filthy and it is need of major renovation. When I ask for the name of the managment company I was refused that information. Once I returned home and tried to get a receipt for my stay I could not get any response. Called 8 times and faxed four times and it is now December 30th and I have still not gotten a receipt.

<Content>Clarion Hotel Sucs I arrived to the hotel 12.01 am Monday morning. 05/10/04I had a citizenship to take same morning.. First it started, with the receptionist was looking at me with the expression  what a hell do you want Then he gave me a room 5 th floor. I asked him to give 2 wakeup calls. I went up to my room lamp was out next to my bed. Then I chkd the phone if it is working or not.  There was no line telephone was not working in 4 star hotel.!Then I had to go down again ask for another room. he says to me. oh well, it is not connected by us yet! ?? Then I told him give me another room.  he says well it was a suite are u sure you want to change your room ??? When I am expected to hear  I am sorry mam we'll get you a better one. Hallo!Then I went to my new room. Such a smal and dirty room. You can see the dust around the bed and also all around the edges of the carpet , within the room..So, I said oh well go to bed because there are only couple of hours left!In the morning I woke up around 6:45 am not with their wake up call By chance.!  He forgot to switch the wake up calls to the new room when I got a new room If I was not going to wake up on time with my will I was going to miss the entire ceremony for my American Citizenship.!!But when I mentioned that he said that he is sorry!What a joke and what a night mere I have had at this hotel. I am a former flight attendant. I had been around the world. But worse comes to worse, I have never seen a disaster hotel I had in my life!..It was going to cost me my American Citizenship because they forgot to give me a wakeup call. I 'll never stay in Clarion Hotels period! I 'll never recommend to anyone either! Go to Marriot, Intercontential Sheraton or something, but not this hotel..!
