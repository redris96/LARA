<Content>Decent but not more This hotel was decent. We were in another building owned by the hotel which was about a block away -- little annoying to have to go to the main building for breakfast (which was quite basic but ok), but this wasn't a big deal.The room itself was ok. Bed was comfortable and it was quiet, but I did not like how few ammenities there were (lack of towels, for example). Spotted a couple spiders and such as well in the room. Our room had a door that opened up to a 'garden' type of place, which was nifty, and I assume this is where the bugs came from. There was a TV with satellite, but it would stop working after a few minutes.Location was 15 min away from the heart of the city though only 5 min from the main station; no complaints here.All in all, it was an ok stay, but I think I'd choose another place in Florence next time if I can find something at a similar price.

<Content>A great little hotel I read all these reviews before I went to the hotel, and was wondering what to expect, but we were so pleased with it. I imagine those people who complained of not being able to find it didn't go to the hotel website where they have very clear instructions where they are, they are on the second floor of a larger building so don't expect a front door on the street, but there is a clear sign. I found the staff helpful and always with a smile, one man marked on a map all the places of interest when we said it was our first visit to the city. They don't have the best English perhaps but no one was surly or rude... may I suggest that the more demanding travelers who expect the hotel staff to do a lot for them take this into account. If you simply want to have a clean hotel, very close to the centre, who give you a nice breakfast and then go your own way for the rest of the day, this is great. It's 3 star, it doesn't lie about that and I hope that the negative reviews won't put people off this very good value hotel. We had everything we wanted and above all it was very very clean when I stayed.

<Content>Nice place to stay We booked this hotel via expedia, and everything was as expected. Nothing more nothing less. We've got our room in the relais, and it was really nice. New furniture, new television, new bathroom. Everything was just perfect. The only thing which was a bit disappointing (but nothing special) was the distance from the city center, as i expected it to be a little shorter.

<Content>Horrible Hotel We booked this hotel as a last minute descision whilst on our honeymoon travels around Italy this year. Our experience was so dreadful we didn't even stay and checked into another hotel. It is extremely difficult to find and get to via a old, cramped lift or stairs, the staff were unfriendly and rude and the parking almost non-existent. Worst of all though the hotel was dirty and the room we were allocated smelt as what I can only describe as if something had died inside. I do not recommend booking this hotel at all their are much nicer four star hotels available for only a fraction more!

<Content>Florence in Spring We found almost impossible to find the hotel whilst driving at night. I would advise anyone arriving in Florence by their own means to allow extra time to find the hotel.The rooms were very well appointed and more than large enough to accommodate my family of 5.The staff were efficient although not particularly friendly.The hotel has parking which is a god send in Florence where there is very limited parking.The location was well suited to our short 4 day visit to Florence. Breakfast of coffee and pastries was included in the price and this was a bonus.I would recommend the hotel for its location and appointments but the staff were a little disappointing.

<Content>Cozy Tuscan apartment! We booked an apartment for 6 at Gemini Studio managed by Hotel Alamanni and I must say, it's one of the better ones we had stayed in Italy. The apartment came complete with a nice spacious bathroom, complete kitchenette and 2 separate rooms for better privacy. The interior decor is nicely done with a tuscan touch and everything else are above our expectations. We arrived rather late, around 10pm from Pisa and the front desk staff was very helpful in providing us with map and information on where to go and how to get there. He even guided us to the fabulous restaurant for a share of the famous Florence steak! We truly enjoyed our stay in Firenze and would definitely be back for a longer trip in the future.

<Content>Good location - shame about the breakfast! This hotel was almost impossible to find in a city where there are major works being carried out just in the centre around the train station. When we did find it, we were relieved that it wasn't too far away from the station which served as a great landmark.The room was above the standard we expected and the view from our room was beautiful. It looked over a little private courtyard and was very peaceful apart from the emergency vehicle sirens which seemed to be passing by every quarter of an hour.The staff at the hotel were also very nice and we checked in without any trouble at all.What let this experience down was the breakfast. It consisted of pre-packed cheeses and tiny rolls and really not much else. Some of the items weren't available and others were stale. If it wasn't for this, I would have rated the hotel much more generously.

<Content>Poor service... Talk about some good things first...Breakfast is not bad indeed. It is sufficient and fresh...the bathroom and bed is generally clean.For negative...it is TOO much...the worst thing is the attitude of the stuff. They are definitely indifferent and arrogant to the guests. When we arrived, they arranged a room for us. It was small and untidy. The air-conditioner is not worked as well. We requested to change another room. The tone of the stuff is terrible and very bad manner. He needed me to wait, not to handle it immediately and said 'Not you want, you want!' If we were not booked on credit card, I must leave with my wife. They are also not helpful to provide information to us...very arbitrary to answer us. When we leave, we stored the luggage in the hotel..but very bad service! The stuff pretend not to hear our question...when we spoke loud to him...he said he got it and need us to wait for him to finish his work...Actually, he is nothing to do in the front desk. Besides, the hotel is not new as the photo shown. The location is inside a residental building. It is in 2/F,...and 3/F,4/F is living with local people. You may not ease to find the hotel. The lift is old and very small. Two people is max. capacity. So, don't bring too much luggage. Internet need to pay. The room corridor is dim and many miscellaneous. I will not recommend this to friends...I think there would be better choice in Florence.

<Content>Our Trip Reviver The Hotel Alamanni was our haven for a week. We got to a point in our month long holiday when we just wanted to stay put and not pack up every couple of days. The travel information office at the Santa Maria Novella Train Station found this gem for us. We wanted to be close to the station so we had easy access to public transport and do a few day trips by train and bus. We had no problems finding it, although a bigger sign would be an advantage. We had a lovely warm greeting, and although we had only booked for one night (in case it was a dive), once we saw our room, we promptly booked for the rest of the week. We had a view of the Doma, which meant we also overlooked the street, but with the double glazing, noise was not an issue. The train station was 5 minutes away, with nice eateries and restaurants in between, also a small supermarket and laundromat close by.We asked advice on a couple of nice restaurants, and were told about Le Rotonda, about 3 blocks away (7 minute walk), and spent a couple of great evenings there, enjoying their excellent food, wine and great atmosphere, with extremely pleasant and helpful staff. Our last two nights were spent in their annex less than 2 blocks north, which again was very nice. They took the luggage up there for us, while we were out for the day. We had a ground floor room with a small terrace into the garden area. Unfortunately no Wifi, but that was not the end of the world. A phone in the entry alcove was handy. Both the main hotel and the annex were spotlessly clean. Rooms were reasonably sized with great bathroom facilities. The fridge was a bonus. Not many rooms in Italy (or France) have fridges. Breakfast was plentiful, although as others pointed out, some fruit would be nice. I would thoroughly recommend the Alamanni to anyone. Thanks for a great relaxing stay.

<Content>Great hotel fab location - good group experience There were 22 in our party (mostly pensioners) and I don't think there was a person amongst our party who had a complaint about the hotel. Its entrance does not do it any favours and you tend to enter the iron gate with some trepidation but once upstairs the hotel is beautifully clean, the rooms are quite generous and the staff friendly and helpful (we also loved the dog). Some of the party were located a little way down the road but were very pleased with their rooms, complete with garden and two of our ladies shared a delightful suite. The reception area is also the breakfast room and lounge area and although breakfast was basic it was adequate. During the evening the group could happily sit around and share news re their excursions over a very reasonable glass of wine purchased in the hotel. Linen and towels changed regularly and in terms of a location - couldn't be faulted - close to restaurants, the station and the main attractions.

<Content>Alamanni - Great Hotel - But.... The Alamanni is a lovely appointed hotel, close to the main station and the town.The staff are pleasant and friendly and make you welcome.As usual, the devil is in the detail;The hotel is on the 2nd floor and shares it's entrance with offices and is difficult to spot - We passed it twice - Not the thing you want after a hard day's travel - Perhaps bigger signage is the answer?I was very surprised that for a well appointed 3 star hotel,there was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room - Also, at breakfast, a refill did not seem to be on the agenda.Another small point, the bread was in the form of little rolls that were rock hard,with no alternative.These small drawbacks could, I'm sure, be ironed out at minimal cost/effort, thereby moving the revue to the 'above average score.

<Content>Hotel Alamanni Best Of Expected After have made my reservation I've read all bad reviews in this site and I feelt scared to stay in this hotel, but my reservation was prepaid and even if i want to i could not make any changes so I went there, SURPRISE!!!!Now I wondering if all reviews have been in this hotel or they have just making mistake with some other hotel in town.First the hotel is located on the second floor but this is well advertise on web site, second if you follow instructions or if do best to call the hotel and ask what the best way to go there they will give you all best directions to go there, just OPEN YOUR EYES.Room was nicely decorated, very clean, and smelling good parfumed, bathroom was gorgeous to be only 3stars hotel, made with marble with everything you need especially a very good water pression and lots of hot water, sorry but this in not less important than many other things, because in many hotels also 4 stars the water pression is terrible and hot water is never enough to making a good shower.Also the rooms futured a fully refurbished minibar, pay per view with flat screen tv colour, NO BEG BUGS, I've been searching for but I couldn't find it, no noise in the night I could sleep like if you would be in the middle of the forest, they change towels every 2 days but your advice so you get for what you pay, not even some 4 stars hotel change linen and towels every day, I don't thing is the most important matter.Breakfast was ordinary nothing special, but certanley with little of everything, only negative point they don't have fresh fruits which I believe in the morning is healty eating fruits, however they serve cereals, yogurt, sweets, cold cuts, cheese and butter, juices and delicious coffee, well it was good but I would prefer espresso but they don't have espresso machine but only american coffee machine.The staff was very polite, and professional, also for this point I would say, is only 3 stars hotel on the second floor with only 18 rooms what will you expect to find the receptionist dressed like at the grand hotel??, staff are casual dressed but they do the job very well.I will certanly return to this hotel, is very convenience close to everything and in some periods of the year the room rates is very affordable to be in florence (very expensive city).

<Content>Decent hotel near city center, good price We switched to this hotel last minute and were very lucky to get a room. We requested two single beds and got a double and a single. The rooms are clean and business-like. The staff were nice. The breakfast wasn't terribly exciting but they had tea, coffee, juice, cereal, yogurt, pastries, rolls, meat and cheese. It was definitely worth it (we got a good rate) and we were a few minutes from the train station which made catching our 3:30 am bus to the airport quite easy. Also, didn't experience any of the noise problems mentioned in other reviews.

<Content>UGH !!!! avoid this place at all costs What an awful place this turned out to be. and they were overbooked, so we were accomodated in another building some 800 yds away, in a kind of bedsit. First of all it is very hard to find the place, especially at night, it is hidden away and you have to go up some stairs to find the door, the hotel is then in a kind of office block. It may have been a blessing that we were located in a seperate building, even though it was very inconvenient, as the hotel rooms looked tiny. Avoid Florence in the mid-summer too, there are so many lovely towns in Tuscany, Florence is a fly-blown tourist trap.

<Content>Hotel Alamanni Really close to the station so not too far to carry bags, as the bus from Pisa airport also drops off there. Rooms were clean, staff were (mostly!) very friendly and helpful, and breakfast was good too! Ask for a room at the back if you want a quieter night, ours was but I would imagine the rooms at the front could be noisy. Easy walking distance to everything, would definitely visit again.

<Content>Comfortable Stay We have just spent 2 nights at the Hotel Alamanni. The room was clean, comfortable, warm and very quiet. We were lucky that we weren't overlooking the busy street in front of the hotel but we were looking at the back of another hotel in the street behind. We had a small balcony with 2 chairs and a table, but no time to sit on them because we needed to see as much as possible. Florence is such a lovely city with so much to see, no spare time to spend in the hotel! The sun was on the balcony during the day so it would have been pleasant to sit there. There was however some kind of pump/motor on the balcony but this didn't bother us because it only seemed to come on for about two or three mins and that wasn't too often, about twice in our 2 day stay.. All in all for what is quite a central hotel and the bb price we paid with superbreak we were pleased.

<Content>We were disapointed with our room Our hotel La Alamania was located about 5 to 8 minutes west of the train station. We were able to find it easily thanks to the directions given by other people who had provided feedback in the past. As have been noted by a past contributor the hotel is located on the 2nd floor of the building. We had reserved a studio several days before, and was disappointed to learn that it was not located at the hotel but a half block away in what appeared to be an apartment complex.  Our efficiency was large enough for a family of four however, we were unhappy with the fact that it smelt of cigarettes as we are not smokers and had requested a non smoking room. Complained to the night manager about the cigarette odor and was given air freshener and told that there were no other rooms available. Turned on the air condition unit and sprayed the room several times with the air freshener to try and get rid of the odor. Kept the air conditioner going for the three days that we were there. The room was a typical efficiency with a refrigerator, sink and stove. Saw an ironing board but no iron. This was not a concern as we had traveled with our own iron. The linen appeared to be cleaned however, the parquet floor was dusty. I could feel the dust on the soles of my feet as I walked bare footed around the room. The room is perhaps ideal for a family who is planning to cook however, for a couple with no intentions of cooking and a wish for a room with a view then it would not be ideal. The bathroom had a small shower located beside the toilet. The bathroom and the shower shared the same flooring which was tiled and it sloped so that the water naturally drained as one showered. To our surprise the studio did not come with daily room service so neither our towels nor our soap was replaced during our stay. We were certainly glad that we were not spending more than the three days there. There was however, a shop located nearby if one wished to buy incidentals and groceries. The Continental breakfast was satisfactory as the hotel served coffee, juices, rolls, ham, bologna, jam, butter and cheese. Although the location was within ten to fifteen minutes of many of the local attractions such as the Dome and Baptistery we did not enjoy our stay there. We felt that it detracted from our visit to Florence primarily because after having pounded the streets all day we wanted to be able to relax when we returned to our room at nights. It was however, difficult to do so because we felt like prisoners, cut off from the rest of the world. This was partly due to the fact that there were no English language stations provided by the hotel on the TV and the room did not have a view. There was also no telephone or internet. On the other hand we found the night manager to be a friendly person and he provided us with a map of the city and briefed us on where all the attractions could be located. We would probably not stay at this location on our next visit to Florence but instead would opt to try and find a room just south of the River Arno near to the Ponte Vecchio (bridge). This area appeared to be a beehive of activity late into the night and it had many wine bars and cafes. It is also about 10 minutes from all the major sights. Undoubtedly it would probably also be more expensive than the 160 euros spent per night for the studio.

<Content>Definitely never again - Surrey, UK Hotel Alamanni was a depressing place situated in an office block with indifferent and less than jolly staff. Our room was very basic even though we had supposedly upgraded to an executive room. It was very noisy at night and it proved impossible to sleep with the air conditioning on as that was very noisy too. Breakfast was at best adequate and the dining area (off reception) very small. If the hotel was full it would be very difficult to seat all guests at the same time. Internet photos were very, very flattering and this hotel does not merit three stars. According to their own stationery Hotel Alamanni is a member of 'Small Elegant Hotels of the World - something we find incomprehensible!

<Content>Nothing to complain or rave about! Hotel has the strangest entrance ever and you will probably spend a good half hour trying to find it when you first arrive. (Its just after all the bus stops and just before the electrical shop on your left hand side).Rooms are basic but clean and comfortable. Make sure you bring some water/food when you arrive as there is no complimentary bottle of water for your arrival after your long journey!Staff member on duty through the day while we stayed was not the most helpful but staff member on evening/night shift very friendly and helpful.Only major gripe is that they only give you fresh towels every other day and after a long day sightseeing in Florence this does not leave them the freshest second time around!On the whole the hotel is okay if you are on a budget but we wouldn't book this same hotel again when we return to Florence.

<Content>liked this hotel with the strange entrance Leave the central station on your right. There is a flight of stairs that you must negotiate with your bags. Turn right again and stay on the right side of the street. On your right you'll see a small supermarket and then a big group of motorcycles of all types. Keep on this side of the street. You'll see the Hotel Nazionne on the left side of street. Keep going until you see crossing line, go across to the left sidewalk. You'll see two flags and a Hotel sign(not the name of the hotel Alammani though). When you arrive there is door with the name of the hotel and a button that opens the door. Go inside and turn right. Two small flights of stairs. Arrive to a very small lift (says for 4 people, but two with bags is a tight fit since two doors open in not out). Arrive to the second floor, open the door that says Alamanni Hotel. Very good hotel. Rooms with heater that works. well lighted. Two channels in English. No spanish channels.Good breakfast, coffee, even capuccino, tea, bread,cereals, yogurt,pastries, ham, jam, honey, juices in comfortable room, well lighted.Wake up call every day that worked.Walked from here every day to see everything you want.Besides the small supermarket mentioned there is a CONAD drugstore nearby that is really a bigger supermarket that is open every day. There is also a small All for 0.99 euro store nearby.

<Content>OK, if you are on a budget Booked this hotel at the last minute through Travelocity because it seemed good value. The location is excellent, it's right next to the Main Railway Station. However, it was more difficult to find than expected as it's on the second floor above some shops with access through a side gate which is locked on Sunday. You have to press a buzzer on the Main Road for the staff to open the gate if it is closed. The staff were friendly and reception is open 24 hours. The rooms have a/c and are clean but small. The dining/bar area is very small and the breakfast buffet selection extremely limited. However, as long as you do not pay or expect too much this is not a bad hotel.

<Content>Happy Inglese! Before going to Florence, we read some very denigrating reviews here. Having, now, just returned, it would be unjust not to refute these.The entrance is, indeed, a little unusual, and could be difficult to spot in the dark. The security gates are opened by push button, both on entry and exit. Stairs or a four person lift take one to the hotel, on the second floor.All barring one of the fifteen rooms, face to the rear or to the side of the building, away from the very busy Via Alamanni.Our room, at the back, was small, clean and very comfortable, with extra pillows etc. provided. TV and telephone both worked well, and we were able to make calls direct to England- not always easy in these places. The really striking thing about the room was how quiet it was for an Italian city, especially taking into account it`s proximity to a huge railway station.The bathroom, with a good shower, was clean and well serviced.We found the staff pleasant, helpful and unobtrusive. The reception desk seems to be continuously manned.If you like to sleep with the window open, bring mosquito repellant. There weren`t many, but, Oh Boy, could they bite!Breakfast comes in buffet form with fruit juices, English cereals, cold meats, hard boiled eggs, rolls and croissants, and, of course, good coffee.Most of the main reasons for going to Florence lay within fifteen to twenty minutes walk from the hotel, and one can avoid the eternal jostle round the station by cutting through to the street behind the hotel.Next time we go to Firenze, we will certainly be looking to stay here again.

<Content>Good hotel marred by poor customer service We spent a week at Hotel Alamanni in Florence and were disappointed by the concierge (with the exception of the friendly night clerk). The room itself was nice and kept clean - and facing away from the street, which was a plus (I didn't find the location to be too off-putting - and it was close to the train and bus station, which came in handy for day trips. It was actually quieter than the area around the Duomo, and much less crowded.) The breakfast was pretty good - not just the continental pastry/roll and coffee, but protein for us Yanks who are used to it (boiled eggs, yogurt, meats). Unfortunately we had to turn in our key every time we came and went, and the day concierge was not particularly pleasant. After reading the review dated March 22, 2005, I have a feeling that I'm talking about the same guy. We would get a curt greeting in response to our buon giorno and after a few days I didn't even bother. I know that another guest had a problem with getting tour tickets in a timely manner from the concierge. And no, we are definitely not high-maintenance guests nor the stereotypical ugly Americans. There is no reason why he should have behaved this way.

<Content>Never again... I have just left the Hotel Alamanni after four nights. This was my fifth trip to Florence and I should have trusted my gut instinct about the location being awful. The hotel is well off-pitch so if you want to be able to nip back for a siesta or whatever, forget it. This hotel is a good mile from the Duomo. The room was fairly clean although the shower room could easily have been improved upon, cleanliness-wise. The cappucino was undrinkable. The view at breakfast was over the platforms of the station (to be fair - if you want somewhere close to the station, this is about a 10 minute walk from the entrance). The bed and pillows were the most meagre I have seen in a hotel. A single traveller, I paid a huge single supplement and was still in a single room the size of a matchbox (one for me to take up with the tour operator I think). The staff, with the exception of one very friendly and smiley person, were appallingly rude, sarcastic and all but called me a liar when I asserted that I had not taken anything from the mini bar and offered to wait while he checked. To cap it all, he then watched me struggle with my luggage and their temperamental and heavy front door, until one of the fellow guests eating their breakfast came and helped me. Not a happy experience.

<Content>Ok. We stayed two nights, and they didn't clean our room from one day to the next. Our wake-up call the 2nd day was an hour late -- good thing we weren't running to the airport. The hotel is conveniently located, just parallel to the train station, and the facilities certainly match those of most 3 star European hotels. It was clean and fairly modern. Breakfast was good. If they had cleaned the room and gotten the wake-up call right, we would have been very satisfied. There are lots of other hotels in walking distance from the train station too.

<Content>Hotel was Okay This hotel was okay. Danielle at the front dest was pleasant and helpful. Hotel is in easy walking distance of the train station (5-10 mintes). Breakfast was very nice.Room was small (typical European) and was clean, but one wall behind the curtain where the window was located had peeling paint and was dirty. Entrance to hotel is off the street and you have to walk up a few stairs to get to the elevator, which was not working when we arrived because someone on another floor had left the door open. As a result we had to climb up 3 flites of stairs with our luggage! Overall the hotel is a good value for the money. I would rate it 2 1/2-3 stars.

<Content>great location, great price, odd way of entry This is a great place and right near the train station. The only thing strange about it is how you enter the hotel. You have to go through a parking gate, then into the back of some building, and then up 2-3 flights of stairs before you hit the lobby! Once we figured that out, we were fine!The room was very nice and clean, and had a large bathroom. The breakfast was very good too - cereal, croissants, juice, cheese, ham, etc.The location is very good as well. We walked to everything, including the ponte vecchio and points across the river. It is about a 10 minute walk to the Duomo. The staff was friendly for the most part, except one guy who was a little odd. We got a great recommendation for a restaurant from them that was fairly close to the hotel. I think it was called La Rotonda... or something like that.Overall, I recommend this place, and would stay here again. The price can't be beat.
