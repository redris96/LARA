<Content>Swissotel Beijing, good choise Hotel has good location next to the main highways and subway station so getting around is easy. Subway is just next to the main entrance (subway system works well). There are plenty of taxis just outside of the hotel and hotel porters always order one for you and tell to the driver in Chinese where you are going. We absolutely didn't have any problems with the taxis. Common areas and lobby bar are spacious and classy as you can expect in a 5 star hotel. Our room on the 11th floor was very clean and nice looking. Not very spacious but to get more space you should be prepared to pay much more in the top end hotels.Staff English skills are not so good but you shouldn't be surprised by that as English is not commonly spoken anywhere in China. Despite of that staff always was helpful and for example arranged tickets to kungfu and acrobatics shows. Acrobatics theatre locates next to the hotel and the show is worth of seeing! Staff in the bar was always nice and service very good.I could absolutely stay in Swissotel again if I'd go back to Beijing.

<Content>Poor experience at the Swissotel We stayed at the Swissotel Beijing for four nights in the middle of a three week trip around Asia. The physical amenities were just fine, but the service is what makes a good hotel -- and the service at the Swissotel is pretty dreadful. For starters, the location of the hotel is good -- near the San Li Tun bar district; subway is directly outside hotel -- and the lobby is nice and spacious. The breakfast that was included with our room was also very good. The room was actually the largest that we stayed in throughout Asia, which we were happy about. It was also clean and the bathroom was spacious. The beds were very, very firm and uncomfortable. The amenities were good, but the employees at the front desk were rude and unfriendly. When we got in, they had lost our reservation and it took nearly 45 minutes for them to straighten everything out, which is always unpleasant but it happens. Later that day, I bought deoderant from the small shop in the hotel. When I opened it in my room, there was a crust over the top of the roller, which was disgusting. I brought it down to the desk to ask then to exchange it and was told that they wouldn't because there was a problem with it. Then the person took the bottle from me and rubbed it down his forearm; he then gave it back to me and said, Look, no problem. Nice way to treat your guests.We asked for restaurant tips, and neither the concierge nor the desk employees were willing to help with any information. Everyone also spoke poor English. Throughout our four night stay, we didn't meet any hotel employees who spoke decent English.We loved Beijing and definitely want to go back in the future, but would never stay at the Swissotel because of the poor service.

<Content>Not really the swiss standard The hotel looks very nice from outside. The lobby is very welcoming with a nice bar and restaurants. However, my room was a bit depressing. - It was stuck between 2 walls so with few light from outside- It had a terrible smell of perfume (in order to remove cigarette smell ?). - The bathroom had no bathtube or basin, there's a single floor with water everywhere once you have taken a shower.I was probably unlucky with the room I got but other colleagues also notified me problems like,- traffic noise (lack of insulation from windows)- sometime too cold or too warm rooms.Depsite all this, the location is not so bad and the breakfast choice is very good.Funny note: they give condom with the bathroom kit ?!

<Content>Much better than expected We stayed 6 days in the Swissotel Beijing for a conference organised in the hotel. We appreciated its location nearby the metro station and in the vicinity of many good restaurants.We booked a room of the executive floors and were not disappointed. Yes, the rooms are small - even on the executive floors - but functional, fully equipped and clean. The air conditioning was quite noisy, even at low. The hallways were clean and smelled pleasantly - at least at our non-smoking floor.The staff of the executive floor reception and lounge was very competent and friendly. We were advised correctly on what to do and what to skip and got a tour arrangement for the musts of Beijing at a lower price than offered by the Tour office at the lobby. The executive lounge offered nice and rich breakfast and snacks during the happy hour, but was crowded in the morning between 7:30 and 8:30.The swimming pool has a slippery floor - can become dangerous and is certainly not the most appealing part of the hotel. There is an ATM in the hotel lobby and a souvenir shop with a good collection of items. Dont hesitate to bargain, you can get as low as 25% of the tag price (and perhaps even lower - but we didn't have so much time...)

<Content>Elegance, style and service We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights at the end of 10 days of travel in and around Beijing. It was a great experience and we left China on a high.The hotel lobby is very atractive. Check in was extremely efficient. Even though this is a large chain hotel the feel is more that of a boutique hotel. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The room has large and very clean. The bathroom amenities were first class. The food at the various restaurants was wonderful, from the vast selection at breakfast, including freshly baked goods, to the elegant surroundings and sophisticated choices at dinner. I would certainly stay at the Beijing Swiss么tel again.

<Content>Thoroughly irritating This is my third time staying in this property. I don't know how other people come to a five-star rating for this hotel, but I can assure this property is nowhere near that after three seperate visits. It's unfortunate my company is still booking me in. Swissotel has spent big money renovating the lobby, cafes and most common area. These places are lovely and well designed, but that doesn't extend to the rooms. I was booked into a non-smoking King-size room, and got checked into a pokey twin bed room instead. When you get in, the first thing you realize is this awful smell of stale smoke. The carpets under your feet feels dirty, and when you go in to take a bath - the bathroom is underwhelmingly two-star standard that I can only relate to cheap motels in the US. There is little toiletries they provide - can I suggest you bringing you own shampoo and toothpaste if you intend to stay? They have the two-in-one stuff I hate more than anything.When you finish your bath, you would realize one or two towels come with a hole, and are small threadbare stuff that's been there for ages. When you are done with that you go out and switch on the TV - it's the tiniest 14 inches that's still in the CRT era. (I suspect there are other people like me, expecting to relax infront of a plasma or LCD TV that's a bit bigger.) Also, you know something is wrong when you need to pull the plug of the desk lamp for your laptop, and the broadband that you have is at a snail pace... And when you get sleepy, you would realize the mattress is so damn hard that's actually preventing you from a proper sleep. You pull the duvet higher - and there are holes on the cover.(??)Swissotel Beijing has got a great lobby, but beyond there is little to suggest a pleasant stay. The rest of the staff appears ill-trained. A manager walked past me three times on my floor - no eye contact, he never even said hi or smiled. They tried to charge us double for a simple request of bourbon with ice in the lounge. (With the most stupid debate - Sir you asked for ice, so that's double price because you get more) The front desk staff did not intend to any receipt when I check out until I ask for it - and they gave me a wrong one.The most stupid one was when I asked to store my luggage on the last day - the bell boy told me he can't take my luggage if there is a laptop in it. That really had blown my fuse, until a manager came over and explained he meant laptops are to be stored in the managers' safe.Simple conclusion - fail to communicate through and through. For the same sum, I had a very enjoyable stay with Sheraton in Shanghai. I'm just waiting for Sheraton to build something closer downtown in Beijing, and when that happens - I'd be happy to pay out of my pocket to get away from this awful place.

<Content>Nice hotel - friendly staff Stayed here for a few of days on a business trip. Nice rooms clean and tidy with enough space to work. Convenient for the metro and no problems getting a cab at anytime. Reasonable food in the cafe, unfortunately didn't manage to try the other restaurants. However, I will be going back in a few weeks and will update this review then if necessary.Internet connection was a bit flaky one day but that may well be a one off. Staff were helpful and friendly and always seemed to be enough people on reception.

<Content>Nice Place Good location -- great local eating places across the street, and a few steps from subway. Hotel is five star, therefore you can expect no less than everything clean and nice. The only thing is they charge for internet facilities. From PEK airport, take cab and run by meter, should be about RMB70-75 including toll only!

<Content>Almost there I stayed at this hotel with a group of friends. It's interesting that we had a mixed view of the experience. Half the group had the executive rooms; half did not. Of those who had the executive rooms, half had problems with the airconditioning. When the head of the group rang up the reception, he was told to open the window. Uh oh.The executive room I had came with a small sitting area near the door. There was a larger TV there and a smaller TV at the foot of the bed. I think it is a nice idea but impractical because the bathroom opens into the sitting area. I was alone and never used that space.Otherwise the room was fine, no complaints whatsoever.The bathroom and bathroom accessories were good, all boxed and neatly tied with a ribbon. They even had a ribbon around the plastic slip-proof bathmat. The wastebasket was not lined--a sign of an upscale hotel.Service quality at the executive lounge and the cafe could be better. Overall, apart from the airconditioning that seemed to have afflicted some of my friends, this was a decent hotel.

<Content>Absolutely Loved the Swissotel Beijing I enjoyed a wonderful stay at this Swissotel! The location of the hotel is very favourable. The subway is just outside the main entrance, and there are cabs waiting at another entrance. In addition, there are ATMs within a 2 min walk.The front desk and the restaurant staff are very friendly and helpful. They were very quick and courteous to act upon my non-functioning key-card. The front desk is large and manned by several employees, which minimizes waiting. The staff are relatively well versed in English, and there is a variety of local and European staff working at the front desk. The restaurant service is prompt, friendly and courteous. One restaurant staff member even helped my friend translate something into Mandarin and wrote it out for her in Chinese characters to ensure smoother communication. There are also friendly staff members at another entrance to help with cabs.The interior of the hotel is great. The hotel lobby was just renovated, and the facilities were spectacular. The decor of the hotel is very nice, modern and very clean.The rooms are excellent. The sheets are new and clean, as are the towels and bathrobes. The furniture is comfortable, much like their beds. The room is well organized, and there is enough space to put away suitcases without any obstruction of walking. The furnishings are comfortable and there is much storage space. The in-suite amenities provided are better than average, including additional toothbrushes, slippers, q-tips and cotton, and nicer lotion, shampoo and conditioner, bathing cap, soap, shower gel and so forth. Moreover, since tap water in Beijing is undrinkable, the hotel provided two complimentary water bottles, located by the sink in the bathroom.The noise levels are very low, and the views are pretty.The hotel restaurant is excellent. We had the buffet breakfast there, and enjoyed it tremendously. The restaurant is large and well organized. The various food stations are well spaced to prevent congestion. The food itself was very good. There were many choices offered, both in terms of Western and Chinese cuisine. The omelet/egg station was well manned by friendly and efficient chefs. The choice of desert, fruit and juice was ample. In addition, the service was prompt and friendly, and the dishes, cutlery and linens were very clean.I would highly recommend the Beijing Swissotel to anyone! It is well worth your time !

<Content>Lacklustre and not up to the standard of an internationally-managed 5-star hotel I chose this hotel because I have a conference at the adjacent Asia Hotel. I did not want to stay at the Asia because it's a locally-run 4-star hotel and I am rather snooty about such things, admittedly. I looked at the website at the Swissotel and thought I'd give it a try. After all, my experiences with (limited) Swissotel hotels are okay so far and it's part of one of my favourite hotel brands, Raffles.But perhaps my expectations are too high. I was disappointed right from checking in till leaving. First, I reached the hotel late (around 12.10 am) and there was no one at the lobby except for a security guard. I signalled to the security to get me a bellboy to help with my luggage. It was only then one bellboy came to me.The check-in was also surreal, as there was no one at the counter and only after I shouted (in Mandarin, anybody there?, twice) that a lady with dishevelled hair (was she sleeping inside the office?) came and checked me in. She initially had a sullen face, but after I gave her my broad smiles did she decide to reciprocate and smile back a little.The room that she claimed she'd upgraded me to was a small one, with a tiny bathroom. The sink was a cramped one, even though there is black marble. The sink was obviously an old one. I didn't know Swissotel is such an old hotel needing refurbishment.The non-smoking room I'd wasn't exactly sans tobacco smell after all. Due to some inconsiderate smokers in neighbouring rooms puffing away, I could clearly smell the cigarette smell from where I am, in a non-smoking level. I hate this, but I know in China, it's really difficult to ensure a non-smoking level sees no smokers at all. Still, call me a sucker, in an international 5-star outfit, I was hoping against hope...The food at the Cafe Swiss downstairs was mediocre. The latte I wanted was supposed to be using skim milk, but they actually told me that they'd run out of non-fat milk. That was the first instance. I didn't take breakfast there but in my last day, ate lunch there. I ordered a steak, medium rare (translating into Mandarin 30-40% cooked, literally). The steak took 45 mins to come, and it was almost well-done. As I was pressed for time, I didn't pursue the matter but went off sorely disappointed.The check-out was also poor. As it was peak period at 1 pm, there was a slight queue. But they did not go according to the queue (I know Beijingers don't follow queues, but still, in an international 5-start outfit?) and I had to elbow my way in at the end because I really need to leave to catch my flight. The reception lady gave a dirty look and throughout the check-out was with a sullen face, despite my many attempts to smile broadly at her. In this aspect, they've failed miserably for customer service.So, what's good about this hotel, you may ask? Location is fine if you wanna take the metro, as the station is right in front of it. But in the vicinity of the hotel, there is nothing like eating places or a convenience store.The rooms, though small, are adequate and the internet speed was fast. Yet, aren't all these expected of an international 5-star hotel anyway? When I was there in the 3 days, I notice that the hotel was hosting the chefs du mission of the upcoming Paralympics. The staff definitely looked stressed and were struggling to cope, in terms of efficiency, in terms of English language and in terms of politeness.So, what would happen if the Olympics come next year? Will they be able to cope? Makes me wonder, or should they just admit that they aren't 5-star and thus not make customers expect too much of them?

<Content>Comfortable but.... Swissotel was at a good price, without breakfast; although we did not know that there was nothing within walking distance to have breakfast. It is located at a very busy intersection a bit off the main tourist sites, but subway stops right in front. The room and bathroom were good size. Staff spoke enough English and were pleasant. If I do not want to depend on taxis (who do not speak English), next time I will stay elsewhere. Also, the lobby is undergoing remodelling and the entrance to the hotel is just a small room that gets very crowded making the entrance and exit of the hotel uncomfortable.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, good location The hotel is quite good. The service is excellent. The prices acceptable. The rooms are big and very clean. The bath is a dream. The beds are very comfortable. Getting access to the internet is very easy. The view from some rooms is incredible. The hotel is in a good location for making shopping or going to some quite interesting places in Beijing. Very near is the Sanlitun bar area, Ya Show Shopping Center and most interesting, the Houhai Park and Beihei Park, as well as the Forbidden City. From this hotel you can reach the most interesting points in Beijing in a short time. All in all a very good hotel. Only the bar inside the hotel is lousy. Closes early, uncomfortable atmosphere and high prices. As well as the beer garden. The prices in the beer garden are acceptable, but it closes early also. So the only chance is to go to Sanlitun. That's close and good. Anyway, this is the only item and it's not important to discover Beijing from a brilliant location. Good recommendation.

<Content>Fair luxury at a great price Swissotel's website provided a great price (be aware of the 15% added fees). Rooms were just as shown in pics - my superior room was a bit on the small side, but very clean and comfortable. Included breakfast buffet was perfectly acceptable, though not the extravaganza described by some others. Location a bit off the main tourist sites, but subway stops right in front and cabs are very cheap. Staff spoke enough English and were never rude or unpleasant. Would definitely stay upon next trip to Beijing!

<Content>A welcome sanctuary in the middle of the city Excellent hotel, good service and great location (subway right outside front door). We were travelling as tourists (backpack, etc), and this was obviously a hotel catering to business people, but we received the same fabulous service. See if you can get an upgrade to an executive room -- we did it when we booked and it was fantastic. We did stay in a regular room on our last night - it was fine but not as luxurious. We felt very spoiled, but we were grateful for the comfort of the hotel after long days trying to wield our way around Beijing.
