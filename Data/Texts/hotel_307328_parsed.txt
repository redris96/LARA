<Content>Great Location, great accomodation, great value Great location, this is the overflow to the pricier Dai-Ichi. It therefore does not have restaurants etc but is more like an apartment block. This does not matter though as there are hundreds of restaurants within walking distance. This is one of the best located hotels for Ginza and its surrounding areas.Great value

<Content>Loved the Dai-Ichi Hotel The room is in a very good order, and the deco is good. Flat screen TV, and a personal computer with free Internet connection are available in the room. The staff speaks very good English and is always very helpful. But you will have to go to the main Dai-Ichi Hotel (2 minutes walk away) if you need to use the facilities in the business centre.The location of the hotel is very good - only takes 5 minutes to walk to the main Ginza shopping area. The nearest metro station is Shimbashi (on Ginza and Asakusa Lines), and it is just a few minutes walk from the hotel (take Exit 7 for the hotel). The Italian restaurant at the hotel is not so good - but there are many nice reastaurants in the surrounding area so plenty of choices are available for dinning. The number of TV channels are limited, but BCC is available in English indeed. You just have to press the sound button on the remote control a few times to set the language into English.

<Content>Absolute Recommended We stayed in this hotel for 3 days - it was a very good experience. The staff is extremely helpful and polite - somebody from the reception helped us to book the hotel for our trip next location. Even if there are some train tracks on the other side of the road, the rooms are pretty well isolated and this was not an issue. The subway station is close, so it's an area with restaurants. The room is clean with a decent size and has free Internet access(we borowed an Internet cable from the reception), fridge, TV, hair dryer, flat screen TV.

<Content>Good location, nice hotel This was our second stay here at the Annex. They have done some of the rooms up since last year (we were on the 7th floor and it was definitely new). The location is brilliant - if you have a JR pass especially so - you are across the street from Shimbashi station and you can use the Yamanote line for free inside tokyo with your pass to get pretty much everywhere you need to go (Akihabara, Shinjuku, Shibuya, etc).There are loads of small restaurants within 2 - 5 minutes walking and of course you have all that Ginza has to offer shopping wise.Bic Camera is right down the street too. What's not to love?They have a new underground passage to Shimbashi station, which is nice if it is raining. There is also a new German (?!?!) restaurant located downstairs next door if you need a quick beer and a bratwurst! We've never managed to make it to the Italian restaurant on the premises - the hours are not good - but there is plenty of great stuff on offer all around.The only downside is not specific to the Annex - the lack of ability to control the room temperature. The japanese like their rooms HOT!We'll be back on our next trip in September, so I think that says it all.

<Content>Comfortable and convenient We enjoyed our three day stay here as it was very comfortable , clean and the staff were extremely helpful. The hotel is in a convenient location within about 7 minutes walk from the metro. If you are on a budget this is an ideal place to be. [Going to the loo in your hotel room is certainly an interesting experience, I laughed like a drain every time I went! Some loos will even play you a tune.] Tokyo is a mixture of ugly futuristic buildings and beautiful historic shrines. It is an interesting place, but I would not want a second visit. Unless you are wealthy, don't eat in the restaurants they are VERY expensive. It is possible to find little back street 'noodle houses' and eat for about 拢12 each.

<Content>Highly recommended This hotel is excellent in terms of value for the money. I had a recently refurbished room on 9th floor. The room was on the small side but absolutely adequate, the most clean one we had in Japan and nothing to complain about. There is enough space for the luggage of two persons. The bed was very comfortable and I loved the pillows -one memory foam and the other feather. We could never hear any noise from other rooms during the 7-day stay. And the massage chair was extra bonus. The best thing was definitely the wonderful view you can enjoy sitting on the large window sill.

<Content>Great Value The annex is typically the lesser of the main hotel, and while we didn't stay in the main hotel, it was worth the savings. The hotels are coordinated, so they work together. We used the business centre at the main, and their porters whisked between the buildings, etc. The tour desk/concierege was excellent at the Annex. The rooms are a reasonable size for Japan, complete with mini fridge, drawers, LARGE desk, and flat screen tv. Each bedside table was reasonably sized with a drawer and shelf. Electric drapes were useful too. The bed, pillows and linens were very comfortable, and well-appointed room. It was quiet, and we really enjoyed the stay for the value. It is not ultra-lux, but very luxurious for its star rating. We took a taxi from Toyko Station, as the transfer to Shimbashi and Ginza would have been tiring. It's well located to high-end Ginza, and very close (underground connected) to the metro station. It was a perfect base for our three nights in Tokyo. This was a great stay, and I would recommend this annex to anyone. We also took the airport limo from the hotel, which then gave us a very late checkout for free (highly recommended).

<Content>High marks for the Dai Ichi Annex I stayed at the Dai Ichi Annex from Dec 22-29. I had a very favorable experience. My room was on the 7th floor. The hallway was spotless as was my room. The bed was very firm, and the room was quite small but immaculate. I rarely heard any noise from other rooms or the hallway in seven days. The front desk staff were friendly and attentive, and most spoke sufficient English to get my questions answered. HUGE PLUS - I brought my Mac Book with wifi access - they gave me a cord and I had FREE Internet access in my room the entire trip. That's a first for me. Great location near several subway stops, shopping, cafes - plus I walked to the Fish Market - an absolute must see.When I got my bill I was expecting some add-ons that typically appear on hotel bills - and there were none (of course I didn't use the exhorbitant mini-bar). I didn't eat at the restaurant - I was on a tight budget. The bus to and from the airport was great - 3000 Yen each way, dropping me off at the Dai Ichi just across the street. 60-90 minutes each way.I'd return to the Dai Ichi Annex in a heart beat.

<Content>Great place to stay Well situated in the business district within walking distance of Ginza and the Imperial Palace and close to a subway station for reaching any part of Tokyo. Very comfortable and modern with a nice restaurant as well as being very close to other eating places. Staff could not have been more helpful and a particular benefit is that the main hotel is a stop on the route of the Airport Limousine service so transit to and from the airport is entirely hassle free as well as cheap.

<Content>Loved the Dai-Ichi Hotel Annex Exceptional value and very good overall experience. Very helpful, English-speaking staff (a non-trivial find in Tokyo hotels), quite comfortable beds, and an extremely convenient, central location adjacent to a major train stop (Shinbashi) and within walking distance to many interesting areas (Maronouchi, Ginza, Akihabura, Shiodome, Tsukiji ec). I noticed a few stains on the carpets, and the dated decor--but what did I care, I only went home to rest, and the bed was comfortable enough that I was actually able to sleep--unlike other Tokyo hotels I've stayed at where the miserable, rock-hard beds were not conducive to resting.This would be my top hotel choice for a return trip to Tokyo.

<Content>Tokyo Favorite I lived in Tokyo for 10 years, and now come back on business every quarter. Although my firm's offices are near the hotel, I would stay here even on non-business trips. The hotel is very clean, staff is very professional and helpful, and the location is just ideal: near Ginza, the palace and many transportation options. Best of all is the price: to get a place of this quality in New York would cost 3 times as much. I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Tokyo on a budget. Some business travelers may prefer a hotel with more dining options, but the area is full of great restaurants.

<Content>Expectations exceeded We stayed 3 nights at this location. I was worried that the quality had gone downhill based on reviews from different websites. We were pleased with the choice and would be likely to return, esp. at a rate of $125 per night in Tokyo!Great location with easy access to Shimbashi station and several other stations, convenient for sightseeing. Right across the street from all of the great little yakitori restaurants and other places tucked under the Yamanote train line. I prefer this location over others in Tokyo because there's good access to lots of late night places and lots of sightseeing opportunities (often using the train or subway), but not nearly as busy as some areas of Tokyo. Also, several coffee shops within shouting distance of the hotel where you can get a morning set of coffee and some sort of breakfast sandwich, pastry, etc. We did not use the hotel restaurant or the sister hotel's restaurants (sister hotel is the more expensive Dai-Ichi Hotel, located right next door).Fantastic front desk staff with good English and very helpful in finding various locations, etc. The room was of adequate size. I've certainly stayed in smaller rooms througout Japan. We had access to CNN/BBC and they gave us an English language paper in the am.Found the room to be clean and not smokey. The hotel is looking a bit worn in some areas, but they were undergoing a renovation while we were there. A few floors at a time. We were in no way inconvenienced by this and probably wouldn't have known it was occurring had it not been for the signs and then the delivery men bringing in new mattresses one day.The mattresses: hopefully the new mattresses are an improvement? A little saggy and not the most supportive, but I like a really good mattress and so try not to be too judgemental on this point when staying at a hotel. Just pointing it out for others. We'd be very likely to return to this location (esp. with those rates!) in the future.

<Content>Great Hotel: Clean, Modern, and Convienent This was a great hotel. Its located minutes from Ginza 2 blocks away from the train station. If you are looking for a hotel with banquet rooms, botiques and bars, this is not for you. If you are looking for a convienent location, modern clean room, and great staff, you have found the place. They are currently in the process of renovating the hotel and we stayed on one of the renovated floors. The rooms were very modern, nicely decorated, with large flat screen televisions and a large desk. There were both japanese and western robes for the guests. We stayed at other hotels rated higher from this website, but enjoyed this hotel much more. We will stay there again.

<Content>Not Clean nor Non-Smoking We had reserved a room here after a family member had stayed here 2 years ago. He had recommended the room. Well, the years seemed to have taken quite a toll on this hotel. The halls were dingy, and rather worn. The rooms were marked up, especially the walls, by black luggage.We had requested a non smoking room. Unfortunately, the non-smoking was a serious issue for me. They do NOT have non smoking rooms. They simply remove the ashtrays and spray some air freshener. If you are sensitive or have allergies, you have a few options. I resorted to using those face masks sold in drug stores, to filter the smell of smoke.Also, our first room was not clean, and what appeared to be a bloody handprint was on the wall. When we went back to the front desk and complained that we had specified a non-smoking room, we overheard the manager saying oh no! it still smells! They ended up giving us a less smelly room, but just barely. The location is ok, but you will miss out on the more interesting neighborhoods. If you're looking to get a slice of 'normal Japanese' life you will need to take the nearby subway. This is a very sterile area at night, mostly filled with businessmen and civil servants out on an expense account.

<Content>Good Location In May of 2005, we stayed here for two nights so we could see Ginza, Tsukiji Fish Market, Tokyo Tower, Zofoji Temple, and we got out to Obaida - all great fun and interesting. The non-smoking room and bathroom were good sized, clean, and comfortable and included a tea service. (We had gotten a discounted room that was very reasonable for Tokyo!) We had no trouble with check-in or out and stored our luggage for the day, the day we left. I use a small power wheelchair and had no problem at this hotel. The staff was very nice and helped as they could. One gentlemen took our picture for us. The trains are across the street, but we never heard them. We were able to eat at various places along the way...it was an easy walk to Starbucks for breakfast and we ate Japanese foods the rest of the day.

<Content>Terrific location Our stay at the Dai-Ichi Annex is very comparable to what other reviewers have said. It's in a terrific location for shopping, restaurants, and public transportaion access. The staff is very very helpful. The facility itself is in need of a make-over. Everything about the place is a bit worn down and a little sad, but clean. We were disappointed with the hotel restaurant. However there are so many terrific area restaurants that are worth exploring, so don't waste your time at the hotel.

<Content>Great Ginza Located Hotel at a Reasonable Price The other reviews correctly described this property that it needs a slight refurbishing. Our rooms were very clean though, I noticed some slight wallpaper peeling in high traffic areas but no where else. The rooms were quite small, similar to European or HongKong hotel rooms (about 2/3 the size of normal US rooms), definitely no place for more than 1 queen bed. Service was great, good english speaking staff, and they were always there to help.Getting in from Narita was also a breeze, just took the Airport Limosine Bus that goes to the Dai-Ichi Hotel which is just next door, we essentially just crossed a narrow street to get to the Annex.The location of this place is great if you want to stay in the Ginza area. It is about 2 short blocks away from the Shinbashi train station which is serviced by several subway and JR rail lines. It is also about 10 minutes walk to the Ginza shopping area.We did not try their restaurant (nor the ones at the main hotel) as we wanted to save money. Hotel restaurants we found typically charged about 3-5 times what you can get someplace else.When we booked our return airport shuttle with the front desk, they also automatically extended our checkout time (about 3 hours) at no cost, so that I can stay and use the rooms until it was time for us to leave. Also our baggage was checked and transported by the bell man across the street to the main Dai-Ichi hotel, and automatically loaded to our bus.We also found that typically the Japanese refused to accept any tips, I was told that some people actually get insulted by giving them tips, so we refrained from doing so.Overall it was a great 4 night stay at a better than average hotel at very reasonable rates and I can recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Fantastic Value and Excellent Service I stayed in the Dai Ichi Annex as a tourist for 9 nights in April 06. For the price, I found this hotel to be an absolute gem, being far better value than hotels in New York, London, Paris etc.It鈥檚 true that some of the paintwork and furnishings in the lobby could do with updating but the location is fantastic and the staff are a real asset. Shimbashi Station is a couple of blocks away which provides underground access to the whole city. There are plenty of cheap eats and more expensive restaurants within walking distance and mini markets 7/11 and Lawsons can supply snacks drinks etc. The hustle, bustle and bright lights of Ginza are just around the corner as is the relatively tranquil Hibiya ParkThe English speaking concierge can offer advice for the tourist and will book any sightseeing excursions on your behalf, she also keeps an impressive stock of leaflets, timetables etc and even printed out a weather forecast in English for us.The room was adequately sized and extremely clean, fresh towels, kimono and European style robes were supplied daily. A couple more English TV channels would have been nice, but the electronic curtains and toilet made up for that. The mini bar was quite expensive but well stocked.As a tourist on a budget I found the Dai Ichi Annex provided a quality of service that far exceeded my expectations.

<Content>Annex is Both Good and Bad Our experience at the Dai Ichi Annex was both good and bad. (First the bad). When we made our reservation, I specifically stated that I wanted a non-smoking room, and when we checked in, I again verified that we were, in fact, getting a non-smoking room. We went up to our room, opened the door and just about choked from the smell of cigarette smoke. They said they couldn鈥檛 give us another room because they were all booked up, so we just had to grin and bear it. On the good side, the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Once, I went down to the lobby and asked someone if she knew what train I should take to get to Yokahoma. She went behind the main desk for about five minutes and came back with maps, brochures, and various guides. She even gave me advice about what to see and what not to see鈥?I really appreciated that鈥?This mix of good and bad seemed to characterize my whole experience at the Annex. You have free internet access if you have your own computer. Great. If not, you have to go next door to the main hotel and pay 1010 yen per hour. Your room comes with free cable. Great. But you only have two channels in English. (And you have to pay for movie channels.) The Dai Ichi isn鈥檛 a bad hotel. In spite of everything, our time there was fairly pleasant. Yes, the interior is a bit old and worn out, but if the point of your stay is to see Tokyo, you won鈥檛 be spending much time in your room, anyway. If you鈥檙e on a tight budget and just need a place to lay your head at night, you鈥檒l be more than happy here. But if you expect a lot from your hotel, you might be happier some place else.

<Content>Excellent Value! This hotel is the best buy in Tokyo! You are definitely getting a huge return for your money here! Tokyo is extremely expensive no matter what, but this hotel gives you a decent-sized (for Tokyo, anyway), comfortable room, nice amenities, and OUTSTANDING service! Definitely stay here if you are on a budget but still want a decent hotel. Room was spotless. Bathroom was so clean you could have eaten off the floor (seriously). Free bathrobes AND cotton kimonos/slippers, refreshed daily. Very nice toiletries. Excellent, English-speaking concierge, lots of English-language stations on TV. Great location close to Shimbashi Station and Ginza. Shuttle bus service to Narita Airport, booked for us by concierge. Would definitely stay again!

<Content>Great Choice for Tokyo Our first trip to Japan -- our first visit to Tokyo. Booked a week in the Dai Ichi based on recommendations from TripAdvisor reviewers. We were really pleased. As other reviewers have mentioned, the location is great for local services and access to transportation for seeing the town. The Urban Dining supermarket under the JR Shimbashi station is just a couple of blocks away; kept us in gourmet snacks at reasonable prices. Dai Ichi Annex is an easy walk to the legendary Ginza shopping streets and to the equally legendary Tsukiji Wholesale Fish Market. Staff at Dai Ichi is very helpful; our first room had a hitch in the free internet access Dai Ichi is rolling out at the annex, they moved into a room with ethernet we could use with our own computer at no charge. Rooms have been discussed here, average size for a large city hotel, and very well equipped and maintained. Dai Ichi has an airport bus service. We'd definitely stay here again.BTW, don't miss the Tokyo Food Page website and Tokyo Metropolitan online for restaurant and entertainment tips. Really enhanced our first trip to Tokyo.

<Content>Pleasant Stay at Dai Ichi Annex We stayed at the Dai Ichi Annex for 3 days and had a pretty pleasant time there. First of all, it is so convenient to get to/from the airport because the Limo bus just drops you off right next door at the parent Dai Ichi hotel which is only a few steps away. The hotel itself was very clean and did the job. It's a basic hotel room, which was a little small but that's expected in Asian countries. We didn't expect anything ritzy and we got just that.The location is the best as its so close to the subway station (Shimbashi) and it's conveniently located within the Ginza area. So there's plenty of shopping and food places nearby. There is also a great Japanese supermarket right by the train station.For the price and location of this place, we recommend the Dai Ichi Annex!

<Content>great location, more than adequate As virgin travelers to the Far East, the Dai Ichi Annex was our 1st port of call in a hectic 7 days. Jet lagged and weary, we checked in very pleasantly and were shown to our room, which we found somewhat small and were able to change it promptly and courteously to another room which we were told was 30 sq ft bigger. It did feel airier, and made our 2 night stay much more pleasant.Compared to some of the mega 5 star hotels we were to stay in in other cities as we headed south through Japan, the Dai Ichi Annex was quite basic, but it doesn't claim to be anything more than that.It was quite clean (sheets, towels, bathrooms etc) although the actual bedroom was a little gruppy (stains on the carpet, tears on the wallpaper etc). However, it has a wonderful central location, has a great proximity to train and subway stations, was inexpensive, and has a polite, couteous staff.As a good value, competent starting point, whilst you are getting acclimatised to Tokyo and Japan, I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Great location and service but This hotel is in a stellar location right near the main shopping and restaurant areas of the Ginza. The service was wonderful but the rooms just weren't good at all - too small with a double bed that had a mattress of concrete. We stayed there our last night in Japan after a 10 day trip. I'm glad it was only for one night. When we were planning the trip, I was actually deciding between this one and the New Otani for the first four days. Fortunately I went with the New Otani. Would not go back to this one after staying at places like the New Otani and Hotel Granvia in Kyoto. Too many other great hotels to choose from.

<Content>Mixed Thoughts As already noted - good location to transport and Ginza plus other sites. After 3 nights the small room and bathroom were a bit restricting especially since storage not good. Staff spoke adequate English and were without fault when asked for advice and for extra items. OK for a quick stopver but would go for somewhere a little larger next time - even the Ryokans we stayed in had more room!

<Content>Small room, lumpy bed I stayed at Dai Ichi Hotel Annex for 4 nites in Sept 2005. I booked a standard room thru Expedia for a reasonable price. There is very little drawer space to hold your clothes  the room is small compared to other hotels. The light bulb over the bed was out when I checked in  I waited to see if Housekeeping would ever change it or notice it  it never got changed. The bed  pillow were very lumpy, which resulted in sleepless nights. Note that the hotel was charging $21US (which is outrageous!) to use the nearby pool, located in another building next door. The front desk's English capability was so-so. I did take the limousine bus to the airport upon leaving, which was convenient. about US30.

<Content>The True Skinny on the Omni We paid $129 base rate here compared to $168 at the New Otani. The extra money gave us superb service at the Otani vs. the run-down, ugly rooms at the Annex.While the staff is very pleasant, their English is very basic. The rooms are a shadow of their former selves - decades old style and worn out. While clean, the room is extremely basic. Spend the extra money to really enjoy your vacation and stay at a top hotel. This one is merely a place to stay and will in no way enhance your vacation experience.The location is, admittedly, convenient to hundreds of neat Mom  Pop restaurants, 20 minute walk to the fish market and Ginza shopping.

<Content>Lovely location, big rooms for Japan We stayed three nights here, and we were delighted. The location is great, and we got from Narita by limousine bus. The railtracks are fascinating - a huge mix of restaurants, bars and shops, with a range of prices, and lively atmosphere. The rooms in the hotel are big by Japan standards, and very well stocked. All of the staff had functional English, some of the staff had perfect English, and they were super-efficient and helpful. If you like jogging, they even had a fold-out map, and the Imperial Park and Hibiya park are both on the doorstep. After being stampeded by thousands of joggers on a fun run (in the opposite direction!) I stuck to circuits of Hibiya Park, which is lovely. Ginza is close by, and we walked everywhere. There are some great noodle bars, and coffee bars and a handy corner shop. Meals were somewhat expensive at the hotel, but there were lots of reasonable places to eat in the area. In fact, what struck us most of all was how reasonably priced Japan turned out to be - one of the bonuses of zero inflation. We loved this hotel, and slept very well. We had great views, and will definitely return to this lovely area.

<Content>This Hotel Made the Trip to Tokyo so Much Easier..... This hotel was centrally located to the train and the exclusive Ginza area which was very convenient. The help in the hotel is superb. The cleaning services were great and very consistant. The conceirge was extremely helpful in helping guide our way to eveything we wanted to see and visit in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Hakone. Theyll make the reservations and have the bus waiting for you in the morning! It was great! They even electronically have the elevator door opened for you once you walk in the lobby! Also, the checkout time is very flexible considering the time that they schedule your bus pick-up. Very considerate! Overall, this place is great, especially for the rates it offers. To use the internet in the business center was only $5 per 30 minutes and phone calls to the US were approx 40 cents per min. Also, the mini bar wasnt too expensive soda can for less than $2.50. Highly recommended. The best home away from home I've stayed in.

<Content>A Great Value! We spent 4 nights at the Dai-Ichi Annex Hotel in August. We caught the JR Narita Express train into Tokyo station, about an hour's trip, then waited on the same platform for a few minutes, catching the next train to the Shimbashi Station. The hotel is a five minute walk from there. In fact, if you come out of the station near the big steam engine train in the front of the station, just look up at the skyline and you'll see the Dai-Ichi Hotel. The annex is across the street from it.From the second we walked through the doors, we were served with care and courtesy. The bell girl immediately took our bags and took them to our room on the 9th floor. Check-in was easy (we had booked through Expedia) and, though small, the room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. We never heard a sound from another room or even from the hallway. The bed was very comfortable, more so than most hotels we've stayed in. When we called housekeeping for an iron, it was brought to our room right away. I will say again the room was small by American standards, but I expected that it would be. We requested a room next to ours for our daughter and son-in-law, and they happily accommodated us.It is aslo centrally located, near major train stations and great restaurants. The breakfast buffet is expensive, but there is a McDonalds 2 blocks away, and a Tully's coffee one block away if you prefer to not spend $25 for breakfast.I will stay there again. A great value.
