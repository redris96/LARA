<Content>LA to visit daughter My husband and I were in West LA to visit his daughter, who had just moved to this area 3 months ago. We picked this motel location by zip code, because it was closest to her apartment.We had just finished a 4 month long motorcycle trip across the USA, and had spent at least 100 of the past 120 days in motels across the country. This was the first Comfort Inn of this trip, however, even though we had visited Comfort Inns in years past..First, I have to say that you cannot judge this hotel based upon it's location in W. LA - this area is what it is, and you shouldn't expect anything more than a barrio atmosphere. Be aware of your surroundings and you won't be in danger.We ate at a great Mexican restaurant nearby, named Casita del Campos about one mile from the motel, on Hyperion. Be aware that there is a charge for self parking your car in their lot.The motel itself looks as though it has been renovated. The furnishings are newer, our king sized bed was very comfortable and had 5 pillows. The bedding is clean as were the towels, and bath fixtures. The long review from the lady from NYC from September 2007, explains everything very well, as to room amenities, staff, breakfast, etc.The only complaint is that the carpeting in our room (#211) was filthy. I am also from NYC, and I don't scheeve easily, but our socks were ruined by the dirt, and we won't dare walk barefoot! I took one of the hand towels and rubbed it on the carpet near the bed, and was appalled by the filth it picked up. The carpet and room have a smell (probably caused by the dirty carpet) that permeates the entire area. The odor actually awakened my husband and I during the night. We sprayed the room with Febreze, but it did little to mask the stench.Unfortunately, we are at the beginning of our 2nd night here, (out of 3), and I don't know if I'll be able to tolerate the smell that long. I considered asking the desk clerk if we could change rooms, but I doubt that our room is the only one with dirty, smelly carpet.If you are considering staying at this Comfort Inn location, I would suggest you call the hotel directly, and ask them to put you into a room where the carpet has been recently cleaned. Other than that, the place is perfectly serviceable, if you must spend time in this part of LA.

<Content>Lovely and spacious suites.. Location:Located out of downtown Los Angeles in an area called Silverlake. This is a very Mexican style community and no staff around appeared to be American. The area was OK, shops were a good 15 mins walk. I recommend the 99 cents store to stock your fridge up!Check In:A reasonable check in experience. The lobby is nice and has a pretty fish tank on display.Hotel:The hotel itself is very good. The suite we had was very spacious so we had a lot of room even with our cases laid out on the floor. Bathroom was good. We had free wifi, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, HBO, free breakfast.. (Bagels, cereals, waffles, fruit, juice, coffee, toast etc...) all very good for the $114 a night rate we picked up.Staff:The guy who checked us in was a nice guy, however I was disappointed when I checked out as the lady serving me wasn't paying any attention to me at all. She was on the phone dealing with another customer and trying to serve me at the same time. Also she was speaking in Mexican the whole time to her collegue so I had to keep repeating myself to her as she wasn't listening and couldn't hear me over her speech. She was very rude in my opinion. Kind of the only real downer to the whole hotel experience, but I left disappointed due to this poor customer service/acknowledgment.Overall:This is a very well priced hotel. You receive a great spacious room with all major amenties you require. The location is a bit of a let down and the area is rough, but you can commute fairly easy downtown, Hollywood or Santa Monica. I would recommend this to anyone looking for cheap LA accommodation.

<Content>Worst hotel ever This hotel was like having the vacation from hell!I travel a lot, but this was one of the worst hotels I ever stayed at. I wrote the Choice Hotel corporationl, and they did not even bother to reply to my email.-Construction was going on.-Asked for Non-smoking, got a smoking room- Blood on the sheets, -Cigarette burns on the bed comforters-blood by the basin-asked to change for a different room, was told none was available, and we were not compensated for the poorly maintained room were in.

<Content>Reasonable rooms but not very nice location My wife and I stayed here for two nights in May 2008. The rooms were Ok for the money but I identified two problems. Firstly the location is not very nice and we did not feel comfortable walking in the niehbourhood after dark. Secondly I was not happy with the security. Basically at most times of the day anybody can walk up from the garage area and into the hotel corridors. Admitted there are cameras but I did not feel safe. With the experience of another Comfort Inn we stayed at later in the trip I will not be staying at Comfort anymore. I would recommend staying at Santa Monica if you have to visit Los Angeles/Hollywood.

<Content>Convenient, competent, clean I agree with other reviewers: This Comfort Inn may be simple and unremarkable in most ways, but it's run by a friendly and caring staff, it's very clean, the rooms are up-to-date and spacious (at least my non-smoking king was), the breakfast is in line with that at comparable motels, and--most of all--the location is excellent for either Downtown or Silver Lake. This access is a real plus, and so is free parking in the building, which would be non-existent in a downtown or West L.A. hotel. I stayed here while attending a meeting at the Los Angeles Convention Center, but also wanted to be able to visit a relative in Silver Lake. The Comfort Inn, as others have noted, is really a mile or so south of Silver Lake proper, but you can be in the heart of that wonderful neighborhood in minutes. More to the point, you can be downtown in 15 minutes if (and this is important) you avoid the temptation to take freeways, which at certain hours will delay you hopelessly. Instead, take Sunset Blvd. to Alvarado St. and it's a straight shot to downtown. My room facing Sunset was slightly noisy due to car traffic on a Saturday night (ask for one facing the other way if this is a concern) but not enough to make a difference to me. Generally speaking, I'd call the immediate surroundings uninteresting, not frightening as some reviewers seem to suggest; there are some pleasant-looking antique shops and a potpourri of ethnic restaurants.

<Content>Strange, but nice There was some construction going on at the property, so parking was tough. However, I had a rear facing room and it was amazingly quiet, especially considering how noisy the area is. It's not in the greatest neighborhood, but there were some good restaurants nearby, and the location is good as far as accessing downtown.

<Content>excellent value, great location in silverlake! after living in silverlake for over a year and moving back to NYC, i knew i wanted to stay downtown near my old neighborhood for a trip back to LA. but then i found an even better location at the comfort inn, right in the middle of silverlake! it's cheap, i think my rate was $110/nite. and clean. it did smell like smoke a little, i probably could have asked for another room, which i recommend asking for a non smoking room if they have any. but the hotel was good for what it was, i wasnt ever spending much time in there anyways! i was out and about, hanging out, eating, shopping, going out at night. it's so close to my favorite bars and restaurants in silverlake and los feliz, echo park...i recommend the comfort inn! and this is from someone who stays at 5 star hotels for work trips! i don't like wasting my own money on hotels that are expensive.

<Content>Not a great location, but hotel is ok The hotel itself is comfortable enough - our room was quite large, the bed was comfy and it was clean and warm. Amenities ok. The public areas of the hotel are nothing much to look at but it's clean and the people are nice.The location is not the best for tourists - we mistakenly thought it was at the Hollywood end of West Sunset Blvd and it is actually miles in the other direction in a slightly seedy seeming neighbourhood where we didn't feel entirely safe. That said, there is good public transport nearby and it's easy to get around. There are a few restaurants and convenience stores, a launderette etc around the place, but not a great variety.

I was not expecting too much of this place and was very surprised by the room, it was large, and quiet with a coffee maker, microwave and fridge. The morning breakfast bar was a great with a good variety of items. Loved the make your own waffles which were very good, the only thing bad on the bar was the cheese (yuk!) didn't think cheese could taste yukky, lol. Great location, for driving to hollywood, but not a good location to walk to anywhere.

<Content>What is all the fuss about... It's OK!!! I booked a five night stay at the Comfort Inn on W. Sunset Blvd and I was overall very pleased with the accommodation. All the bedrooms are large, very clean and quite modern in appearance. The beds are ultra comfortable - large and I would say quite new - the TV works unlike in some hotels and has many channels if you can't be without your TV. Breakfast is OK - very standard and very American - waffle making machine, bagels, pastries, fruit, cereal, etc... Having a car in LA is essential as the public transport is very poor. The hotel is situated on a busy main road. The area is very safe. Car parking for guests at the hotel is free and there is plenty of parking available. The hotel location is very central if you have a car otherwise not so good. After reading all these reviews before I left I was quite unsure whether I wanted to stay here but I can honestly say it was absolutely fine and met all my standards and requirements. If you are thinking about booking a room book with the hotel website www.choicehotels.com direct and select Internet User in the Best Available section - you will not get a cheaper price elsewhere.

<Content>Back again...no problems Back again.... second time staying at this place in 3 months- although this time not on business so for a little longer.Stopped in LA for while on a well earned vacation taking in a road trip... this was my first choice of place to stay in LA, knowing the city a little better by now.Pretty much the same as my earlier review in mid- september- cheaper than anywhere else I could find except for all but the sleaziest 1* places in dubious locations (inglewood? I wouldn't...) and again, no complaints. People compaining about the location need to remember that the majority of Los Angeles is sleazy.....!Location is honestly nothing to worry about if you have a car ( and you NEED a car ).... Close to the 101 f/way, couple of mins drive to hollywood, easy to get downtown..beverly hills not too far...If you don't have a car, then perhaps look elsewhere...Internet worked flawlessly again (ask for code every day at reception) and is fast, the place is v clean, plenty of room, free secure under the building parking, and its quiet.Once again, with the hiltons et al all pricing up at well over three to four times the price, you have to question why..

<Content>Good for the Price Pretty good value for the money. This hotel is located only two blocks from the Chinese Theater and major Hollywood attractions. Parking is free which is a huge advantage. Free continental breakfast is nothing special. The rooms are reasonably sized and recently renovated with plasma TV's, fresh paint, and rather comfortable beds. We stayed one night, but highly recommended for people partying in the downtown Hollywood area.Only negative, cable didn't work properly and making the channels unwatchable. Also, you could hear the traffic (including alarms) and other guests at all hours of the nice. Basically expected for a Hollywood motel.

<Content>2nd Time Uncharmed I booked my family to stay in this hotel in August 2006 and we had minimal problems. However, I booked a single night in May 2007 and I had some major problems. In particular, managment refuses to allow you to check in before check-in time. Fine. This is their policy.However...We received a phone call every five minutes from 11:30 a.m. to Noon the next morning to remind us to check out on time. I felt this was pushy and uncalled for. If I am not allowed to check in a minute early, why should I check out before noon? This hotel is safe with free parking and clean - which is more than you can say for most affordable hotels in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, like most other things in LA, you pay a lot for very, very little.

<Content>more than adequate Our stay at the comfort inn was satisfactory. In my opinion the neighbourhood isn't as bad as has been written in previous reviews. OK, it's not Beverly Hills but its also not in the middle of a slum.Most guests will probably have a hire car and the underground parking is secure. The location meant that the major tourist attractions are within a reasonable driving distance.For those without a hire car, there are buses that run along the road at the front of the hotel to Santa Monica and Downtown LA.The rooms were clean and spacious (although the decor looked a little dated).Overall, a tolerable place to stay for the price you pay.

<Content>Well!!!!! Well having just arrived at this hotel from San Diego (Tula Vista Comfort Inn) i can honestly say i am absolutley disappointed with this place. It is in a rough neighbourhood have no doubts a walk down the street will tell you this. It is not near to anywhere you will need a car to get anywhere of importance.Do not stay here if you are planning a vacation base because this is at the very west end of sunset boulevard nearly in the city of LA. We have just been into town to get something to eat the traffic is murder 1 hour in 1 hour back on an 18 mile journey. WOw give me London anytime. The room was dark it is a smoking hotel and the smell in the supposedly non smoking room was horrible. I wanted to be sick thats how bad it was. This hotel lets down badly the comfort inns around the whole area i have just spent 2 weeks travelling staying mostly at comfort inns for their value this is by far the worst and i advise anyone think again spend a few more dollars and stay somewhere more convienent and safer neighbourhood. As for the smoking side you can tell its a smoking joint know what i mean!!!!!!!!! The room is open plan there is not even a door to seperate the the wash room. Avoid if you are on vacation if you want a place to sleep late at night and leave first thing in the morning this is it. If you want a place to remember this is not it avoid!!!!!!!

The wifi worked well, you just have to call down and get the password and user ID, no charge for use.Free copies of the USA Today. Large selection of cable channels to choose from including HBO. Both rooms had a frige and microwave. Bathrooms were spotless. Breakfast is served from 6:30 til 9:30 includes Belgian waffle. I would reccomend this hotel. Staff friendly and accomodating.

<Content>Not so bad We stayed here for a week and were pleasantly surprised, having stayed at less impressive Comfort Inns around the country. The hotel is a short drive away from trendy Silver Lake. The rooms are surprisingly clean, and the property is very secure, with multiple security cameras in the building. The parking garage underneath is a little crazy, but otherwise a good experience, especially for the value.

<Content>Has to be the best hotel value in L.A.! I booked this hotel based on the many good reviews I read here on Trip Advisor. This is my last night in this hotel and I couldn't be happier with the choice. I don't usually travel alone, and though a New York City native, I did have some trepidation about staying alone in a hotel in L.A.I agree with all of the reviewers who mentioned the excellent security at this hotel. There are cameras everywhere and yes, the front desk is behind a glass partition. Rather than making me nervous by their mere existence, they really have made me feel safer.As for the rooms, I cannot understand how other reviewers have described this place as a basic, no-frills hotel. My room is extremely spacious, as are most of the others I've seen in passing. All the rooms I've seen have been renovated: the vanity is granite, with a new faucet. The bathtub surround is flat-panel stone, with NONE of the grout and tiles that can be covered with mold. In fact, the bedroom and bath are spotless. There's a small, quiet refrigerator and a microwave that sits on granite shelves, and both are also completely clean. The king-sized bed is covered in a luxurious-looking burnt-orange shiny quilted new-looking bedspread. The bed itself could be a little softer, but it's not rock-hard either; this non-sleeper has slept well. Even the entry doorsill and hinges have been replaced. There is a desk, armoire, table, and three chairs, and there is still a huge amount of room to walk around. The carpet is not old, but during my stay all of the rooms were having the carpets restretched and cleaned. The shower is good, with a new, adjustable showerhead. The lighting is good in the bedroom and bathroom, and there are two telephones. My only complaint is that the table and one of the chairs could use replacement.The lobby is small, but furnished with newer furniture in excellent condition, and the small breakfast room is bright and modern, too.A number of people wrote about the somewhat seedy neighborhood. Having driven back all the way on Sunset from West Hollywood to the hotel, the neighborhood does change - stores and restaurants are closed and largely ethnic, mostly Hispanic. It certainly does not have the glitz and polish and lighting of the areas I was coming from. But not once did I feel unsafe. I did not use the underground parking, because the lobby is at one end of a small strip mall with outdoor parking, and I was able to park one foot away from the hotel lobby.After booking this hotel by calling Choice's 800 number, I later did a comparison on Choice Hotel's own website among this hotel and four other Comfort Inns in the area. I was dismayed to see that this was the only one that did not have high speed internet service listed for the rooms. I was about to cancel my reservation, but then decided to call Choice to verify it. They made a direct call to the hotel and told me that they did indeed have high speed in all the rooms. I am using it right now, and it has worked perfectly.I did not have a chance to check out the actual breakfast - I either slept in or had to leave very early before they began serving. But on my first morning I asked the desk after breakfast was over if I might be able to get some bread for toast. No problem. The guy at the desk called and got the woman in charge of breakfast to come down and get me some food. She gave me a plate of bread and pastries and, of course, there is always coffee available.In closing, I must say that I am a snob about hotels. I absolutely cannot stay in an old room; I find it too depressing. And I'm squeamish and easily skeeved, and will not tolerate anything that is not immaculate. Also, I always stay in smoking rooms. This hotel room was not only one step away from being sterilized, it is also the only smoking room I've been in anywhere that doesn't have that nauseating, suffocating smell of stale smoke. And that goes for the hallways, too, despite what one woman wrote about it. I can sniff out smoke anywhere, at any time, but not at this place. They're certainly doing something right.This Comfort Inn has got to be the best deal in L.A. For $81 a night, you cannot get better. And I'd wager that your room in a high-rise hotel would not be any nicer. As long as you have a car and a map, it would be very short-sighted to stay somewhere else. If I return to L.A., this will be my first, and only, choice.

<Content>A good place to stay for that price !!! Our plane was arriving very late but the frontdesk was very welcoming. The room was a really big one. We asked for a quiet one and had a very quiet one. Even the next bedrooms doors snapping didn't disturbed us. Everything was clean, the kitchen corner very well managed. The furnitures are pretty nice and reflect a certain...comfort and welcome. The bathroom had evrything you need. The breakfast area had tremendous waffles. You can take everything you want for breakfast and bring it to your room on a tray. Of course, if your used to luxurious hotel, it's not the right one but if you wanna find the very best balance between quality and price it the right place to stay in Los Angeles.

<Content>An above average Comfort Inn If I could, I would rate this motel a 3 1/2, as it is a little above average, but not really equal to motels rated as 4. This was our second stay here and again I want to state this is a very well run motel with good housekeeping, convenient, free garage parking, and slightly above average continental breakfast. It is a good value. Smoking: if you smoke this is not a problem, but even in the non smoking rooms you might have a stale smoking odor. I didn't encounter any actual smoke during my visit, in the rooms, halls or lobby. The odor is probably caused by past smoking in the halls that leaks into the room. Location: The location is convenient (if you have a car) midway between downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood. There is a bus on Sunset Blvd., but I recommend that you have a car. One last point: Don't confuse this Comfort Inn with the one near McArthur Park. This motel is in the Echo Park neighborhood. While a little questionable in my opinion, the improving Echo Park neighborhood is superior to the McArthur Park neighborhood. Nevertheless, I wouldn't recommend walking in the Echo Park neighborhood at night.

<Content>Non smoking room on a smoking corridor! Let me just say that it isnt all bad. The room was very comfortable and quite new. They gave the most pillows that I had seen on our entire trip (very comfy ones too!)- about 6 on each bed!The breakfast was excellent. Pastries, bagels, cereal etc and it all was very fresh and nice.The problem for us was the cigarette smoke. We booked a non smoking room as we dont smoke and we have a toddler. We were shocked to find that the corridors of the hotel were smoker friendly! So the smokers were filling the halls with smoke which I could smell in our room even with a wet towel across the bottom of the door! I was appalled. We had to walk through it with my son and I am just amazed that the hotel has this policy. When my husband spoke to the front desk regarding this they were not suprised and had heard similar complaints from other guests. However they just stated that it was hotel policy. However NOWHERE on their website does it mention this. You would expect them to have at least one non smoking floor.Many places we stayed were entirely non smoking.The other downside for us was that the area seemed (like a lot of inner LA) a bit on the rough side.Its convenient for hollywood but took over 1 hour in traffic to reach Venice Beach/Santa Monica pier. Its also not convenient for the airport. Next time I would stay nearer the airport which is also nearer to the beach areas.The hotel seemed quite secure though, there were cctv cameras on each corner of the corridor and the underground car park has a gate that can only be opened with a room key after it closes at 6pm. This is also cctv monitored. On the downside there is no room safe and to our surprise no safe at reception!I was woken at about 3am by someone playing about with their car stereo in the outside parking and the sound of traffic is constant all night long.Im glad we only stayed the one night but if you are a smoker and are in LA for seeing Hollywood then im sure you could do a lot worse. Non smokers, people with young kids and those that want the beaches/airport, you could do better.

<Content>absolutely o.k. We spent here 3 nights in April and had a clean, spacious and quite room (not to the boulevard), free parking, free breakfast and free internet for a good price ($84/night). The Hotel is located - of course by car - not far from freeway, Hollywood/Beverly Hills and Universal Studios (coupons available in the flysheet-rack at the entrance of the hotel - you get a discount). Neighbourhood? There are better I suppose but we didn't care about it, as we had not the intention to take a walk in the evening and...the nicer the neighbourhood, the higher the price. Breakfast was o.k: Waffels are good but all these artificial and/or low fat products (milk, butter, sugar, cheese etc.) and all the plastic (tableware, cutlery) needed getting used to me (but is not hotel-specific). Yes, I would recommend it.

<Content>Better than expected We stayed in four different hotels os similar caliber during a week long road trip through Southern California and the Comfort Inn West Sunset by far had the biggest, most well-appointed rooms and the cheapest rate. We only stayed here for one night, but the refrigerator and microwave would have been handy for a longer stay. The neighborhood isn't the greatest, but this hotel has taken several measures to ensure the safety of its guests. We stopped by the continental breakfast on our way out and it was more expansive than I've seen at similar hotels. I couldn't get the wi-fi connection to work in our room, but I saw someone getting an ethernet cable from the front desk when we were checking in.

<Content>Perfectly fine. I ended up staying here for one night when my flight out of LAX was bumped a day.To me, it is in a fantastic location, near Silver Lake, Echo Park, and Los Feliz, all areas worth checking out. It's also spitting distance from the 101 and a block over from a 7/11 if you are so inclined. I think if you find this neighbourhood fearsome you are a bit precious -- I parked outside and the car was fine, and at no point in my travels did I feel unsafe. I'm pretty sure most experienced travellers would feel fine. Everything was very clean. I was given a corner king room which felt tucked away and private. The TV had a lot of channels. The free wireless internet was appreciated -- that always seals the deal for me. (My room was too far from the access point to get a signal, but I was given an ethernet cable by the front desk, which is fine.)In the morning there was juice, all kinds of baked goods (frozen  thawed, but that's alright), waffle batter, fruit, etc. It was much more than what I expect from a continental breakfast.My only issue with the hotel was the rate -- I had a coupon from a local guidebook, but the rate was actually $10 more. The clerk said that they had raised the rate after the book was printed. In my view, the advertised rate should be honoured, as that was what brought me to the hotel. But really, it's a clean, relatively cheap place near some good neighbourhoods and the freeway. I would recommend to a friend.

<Content>Average At Best Location is reasonably convenient, but rather rough. Parking is included, and secured at night.At check-in, reservation through Hotels.com was not in the computer system, but the rate was honored. Service was adequate in the day, surly at night.Rooms were average. Mattress was very hard. Walls were EXTREMELY thin, could hear normal conversation (and worse) easily word for word. Bathroom was clean, with engineered stone walls in the shower/bath (better than I expected).Breakfast (included) was typical continental. Waffles were a plus.Overall, not quite average but maybe earns the rating given the price. Definitely not worthy of anything higher. Would have been worth shelling out a few extra bucks for a different place.

<Content>Stay away from this hotel Ok, upon arrival I was shocked to see that the hotel was in the hood. East of Macarthur Park near Rampart. I should have done my homework instead of trusting this site's reviews. The kid at the front desk was EXTREMELY rude and unpolite. I wasn't charged the rate I was quoted and the hotel refused to fix the problem like their 100% Satisfaction Guarantee reads. The room was small, but clean. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. Even though we only stayed here one night it was a night from hell. We asked the hotel manager if they could either transfer our reservation to another Comfort Inn or not charge us for the room because we were unhappy with the service we received from the moment we walked into the lobby. The hotel manager was un sympathetic and rude, are we starting to see a pattern emerging here? There are much better hotels in the Los Angeles/Hollyweird area that are far better than this one. I strongly suggest looking elsewhere at other hotels. This place downright sucks.. Best of luck everyone!!Jerod Harris

<Content>5 people, 1 room, 1 week 5 of us chipped in to get 1 room with 2 queen beds and a rollaway bed for $110 a night for 7 nights before tax.Pro's: great price, about 15-20 minute drive to sunset strip, always open space in the free secure parking under the hotel, friendly staff, clean and quiet place, breakfast buffet from 630am-930am restocked throughout the morning so you're not going to miss out on certain food by getting up late, leftover coffee and juice still available after 9:30am, room fridge, microwave, and a/c all worked great, decent thai food place downstairs, good hot water pressure in shower, some decent restaurants and convenience/liquor stores within a several minute drive up w. sunsetCons: on the 3rd floor there was NO wifi signal at all (too weak to even show up, wired ethernet was fine,) the remote to our tv did not work (we tried new batteries) and we complained once but it wasn't taken care of, the tv only got 12 channels because it wasn't programmed properly, the bathroom was very small (door almost touches shower,) inconvenient having to recode all room keys daily at the front desk, scraped the bottom of our rental several times going over the steep hump into the garage, rock hard bedsOverall, great value and good place to sleep, get cleaned up, and eat breakfast before going out. With no pool, gym or lounge, and spotty wifi and tv, not somewhere too exciting to relax all day. It was a good fit for us and any complaints were minor for the price of the place.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, secure - will stay again! The location was very easy to get to, and within a few miles of just about everything I was planning to do. The neighborhood is fine. Didn't feel unsafe for a moment. The hotel has very good security, with an underground parking garage,The glass partition between the staff and guests in the lobby was closed for the first 2 days of my stay (mid-late September). On the 3rd day it was open. I asked about this and they said the lock on it was broken and they just got it repaired.Standard breakfast that you find most places these days - bagels, waffles, cereal, juice, milk. All kept very nice and clean with things that needed to be kept cold in a fridge as opposed to a bucket of ice that many places will use.Room was comfortable and clean. Walls seemed a little thin - either that or the guy next to me had his television up really loud. A quick call to the lobby solved the problem.All in all, the place was very well located, clean, and secure. Staff was friendly too.Oh, coffee and orange juice available 24 hours a day - a nice little bonus!

<Content>Great! It was a little disconcerting to come into the lobby and be greeted by the staff behind the security glass. I guess the neighborhood isn't great but they have taken every precaution to make it safe by installing security cams and secured parking. Although the carpeting in the hallways needs replaced, the rooms were very clean, updated, and roomy. The high speed internet access was great and very fast. The hotel even had an ethernet cable that I borrowed since I didn't remember to bring mine. (I'm actually using it to write this review!) Location is good - about 15 minutes from downtown and Hollywood and Universal. Hard to beat this hotel for the price!

<Content>good budget choice. We selected this hotel because on a budget trip which included Los Angeles, and we were plesantly surprised. Not only it was a very convenient solution, but also quite a plesant stay. I would only recomend it for a B/B sort of stay, but we had a nice and clean room, and the complimentary breakfast was better than expected: mostly carb based, but you can make your fresh waffle.Vending machines with anything from water and soda to hot pizza are available on the various floors.The hotel has a free gated parking space, but if you are stuck without a car you can catch the bus right in fron of the hotel which will take you to the nearest metro station in 10 minutes, down town in about 15 and even all the way to Santa Monica, going through West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

<Content>Totally worth the price Staying in LA on a budget is never easy, especially if you have a specific area where you need to be. This hotel is right in the Silverlake/Echo Park area, and is in a great central location to Hollywood and the 101. We ran into no traffic, and while my husband was working, I was able to enjoy the neighborhood. The hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and there was underground parking that was kept locked at night. There is available DSL and what looks like a decent Thai restaurant open late downstairs (I didn't try it). I would definitely stay here again. For a comfortable stay around $85, you can't go wrong.

<Content>Good Room, Good Location, Good Value Last minute plans to attend a business conference in downtown LA, we found favorable reviews on tripadvisor for this location. It was economical, compared to rates downtown...so we took a chance. We were very pleased with the accommodations. The staff was very friendly, the room was good sized and very clean. We always had plenty of clean towels and found the continental breakfast more than adequate, especially in a hurry. The parking was under the hotel and secure. The location was convenient to many other desirable areas to visit. You are in the Silver Lake area of LA, so sunset and hollywood are not far. Downtown was also very near. Access to the freeways was also close. Everything we needed was in the area. It was quiet at night, decent beds...we took our own pillows. The WiFi was very weak in our room, we had to use our laptop in the lobby area for a good signal. We stayed for four days and three nights the second week of June 2006. Overall we would recommend this place for a very clean, basic accomodations, you can't go wrong. I would go back anytime. I hope it only changes for the better.

<Content>nice place Hotel very spacious and clean, had fridge and microwave. Great breakfast with lots of options. Nice staff and very central location to many sights. Too far to walk to Hollywodd but short drive, not to many restraunts in the area. Free parking garage that always has plenty of space and limited access.
