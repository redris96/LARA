<Content>loved all of it For our stay in Amsterdam we search for a cosy hotel in the city centre. Finally we booked in Hotel Amstelzicht. It is situated on the canal and near all the great site seeing of the city.We reserved a canal view suite at the front site of the hotel with a really nice view on the canals. The most surprising was that it was totally quite during the night. In the other review we read something about a nightclub near by the the room was really fantastic. What an atmosphere en space. Top service with an personal touch. Next time in Amsterdam we certainly book this hotel again.

<Content>Kind of gave me the creeps The hotel is located in a really great area, close to the trams and some good restaurants. The view from the front is of the Amstel canal and was really beautiful. I found the reception people helpful and pleasant. The room was kind of creepy. I was a little scared to sleep in the bed (I've heard bad stories of bed bugs) this one did not have any, thankfully, but the bed was terribily uncomfortable. My husband descrided his pillow as a block of wood (I scouted out the pillows first and made sure I got the better ones!). The room was big but needed some new wall paper and carpet. The bathroom was ok. The hotel is located right next to a gay bar which doesn't close till 4 am. Luckily we were there on a Monday and Tuesday night, so the noise was not so bad.

<Content>Noisy room over gay bar This was a real disappointment. The staff were friendly and I found the ultra-steep stairs a curiosity rather than a hindrance. However the room, which was supposedly one of the best, on the first floor with a lovely view of the Amstel, also overlooked a deceptively small but noisy road while the proximity of an even noisier gay bar on the ground floor meant that I was kept awake until 2.00 am at the weekend, and could not leave the window open. The promised WiFi also did not extend into my room -- I was reduced to wardriving a nearby unsecured network instead. There was no breakfast available. The washbasin tap was loose and requests to refill the soap dispenser (inconveniently provided instead of actual soap) went ignored. The bedsheets smelled stale and I suspect were infested with housemites.

<Content>I really wanted to like this hotel ... honest ... We needed to stay for 2 nights in central Amsterdam -- my wife and I + 2 kids (10 and 12). So we needed a proper family room. The Amstelzicht had just enough positive reviews and a rate just on the verge of affordability (170) that we gave it a shot. The positive: good location near Rembrandt plaza. Close to many good things, not too seedy. The main building looks quite nice. Quaint with just enough nice touches. Our room was 2 separate rooms with lots of space, a small kitchenette, and 2 TV's. Perfect for a family. It was clean enough though a fresh coat of paint would have been nice. Towels and sheets were OK.The negative: the family rooms are all in the Annex building. You access it via a lockable gate leading to a private alley. The windows face out into the alley so no possibility of a view. Though the alley was clean with no bad smells, on our way to the check out there was major broken glass from a broken beer bottle.I have no problems with less-than-perfect places but that alley with the awful view is just creepy IMHO. I'm sure that if we were a regular couple in the main building, it would be great but for 170 Euros? Unfortunately, when you're trying to find online, 4 beds in a single room in peak-season Amsterdam your choices are greatly reduced. Perhaps 4 young travellers splitting the cost would find this place perfect ... unfortunately, that wasn't us.

<Content>Quaint Hotel We only spent a night in Amsterdam, and this hotel provided a great base for us to explore the city on foot easily. We were close to all amenities including, restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, internet cafes and the fantastic flower markets.We arrived early in the morning at the hotel and were able to check in and leave our luggage (although we were not able to go up to our room until later that afternoon). This allowed us to enjoy our limited time and get exploring!We were a bit disappointed to be placed in a room on the top floor as we travelled with our 1 year old daughter, her travel cot, pram and our suitcases and we did request something quiet, and easy to access. 3 very tiny tiny and steep flights of stairs later we arrived at our room. Large (apparently rare in Amsterdam), clean and quiet. No views, but all the amenities we needed - tv, fridge, phone, double bed and space!

<Content>Grubby and Dated The description of the hotel is FAR from the reality. We paid extra to have a canal view (which we had), but the room was tired and smelt of stale smoke, which was probably impregnated in the ageing grubby carpet and the filthy yellowing lace curtains. I can appreciate that a lot of hotels in this area are old, but but there is a difference between quaint and shabby, and this hotel certainly is shabby. The staff were at all times very pleasant and the bed linen was clean but you couldn't escape from the fact that it had a 2 star feel about the place. I was left with the impression that the price we paid for this hotel reflected its location rather than quality or comfort on offer. I wouldn't go back there.

<Content>Great hotel Booked this hotel after reading some good reviews on trip advisor. 3 girls shared a triple room at the Amstelzicht for 2 nights. The reception staff were excellent very friendly, smartly dressed and even helped carry our cases. The room was a good size and the shower was awsome, hot and powerful. Would recommend without a doubt. Not the most central location though. Thanks for a pleasant stay.

<Content>Satified but not impress The first thing we have to talk about is the STAIRS!!!!Please beleive all the coments you see on this site because it is true: the stairs as so steep you would think they would be better to call it a lader... it is really unbelivable!!! You lieraly have to keep yourself steady with the next stair...The rooms are clean even if everithing in it is positively old: the carpets, the walls, the drapes, everithing...and not in a historical way just in a old and crummy way.If you choose to have a canal view you will be really satisfied because the view is REALLY amazing. The hotel is in a good spot in the middle of everithing and near the tram station: the trams are the better way to go see everything. Amsterdam is a marvelous city and dont miss to see 2 really important things: the Van Goh museum and the Ann Frank museum... If I have the great chance one day go back to Amsterdam I would not go back to that hotel but it is not that bad... for the price i WOULD SAY YOU CAN DO BETTER.

<Content>Horrific Despite friendly assistance at the time of booking, nothing could have prepared us for this. We booked a Quad Room (we were 2 adults, 2 kids and a baby) for our stay of 7 nights. Although the hotel website and the staff tell you the Quad Rooms are through an alley next to the hotel, I can see now why there is no photo on the website. The alley is disgustingly dirty, next to a VERY LOUD bar that goes on till the morning hours. The rooms were extremely dirty; we ended up calling the reception at 2300hrs to ask for some help and eventually, having received none, asked for a broom and mop and cleaned up our own room! Would seriously advise you take your own towels and sheets. We understand it was high season but it was really a rip-off because other than the location it leaves a lot to be desired.

Location is brilliant, 10 mins walk to dam square.Bad points : Very steep stairs. No breakfast included. Stayed in room 10, carpet was filty. Cost us 300 euro for twin room for two nights. For what we got found this expensive.

<Content>There were mice in the apartments We were in an apartment and it was quite dirty. The floor, the sofa..., not very nice.Windows were old and it is just over a pub, so it is quite difficult to sleep before 4am.But the big problem, and reason why we left the hotel, was that the second night we found a mouse in our aparment! not very nice to live with them. The worst of all, was that when we called to the manager (reception is closed after 22h), they did not offer any solution until the following morning. Hotel manager told us you can find mice in there because it is an old building and it is by the canal, so... we just got our money back and left the site.

<Content>Good location, clean rooms, helpful staff, but... The triple room (room number 14) was in the ground floor of the main building and had both good and negative features. The decoration was nice and the room was clean. However, what was not mentioned anywhere was the not so nice view to the backyard and trashcans. The same backyard was used by a restaurant from the opposite building and the staff had their cigarrette breaks behind our window so we had to keep the drapes closed all the time to avoid feeling like animals in the zoo. Also, they were emptying the trashcans and pouring empty bottles (a lot of them...) from one trashcan to another, which made a lot of noise. According to the hotel staff this never happens before 10 am but during our stay the noise started after 8 am already. So forget about sleeping late in the morning (at least in room 14), it is impossible.Most of the hotel staff was very helpful, first our room was freezing and when we mentioned this, they brought us an extra heater within 5 minutes. Also most of the lampbulbs were broken and it was rather dark in our room (also because we had to keep the drapes closed pretty much all the time), they fixed the bulbs too right after we told them. The quad rooms where in another buildning and they were ok. Definitively better beds and pillows than in the triple room. Free internet. The only little problem with this was an elderly lady who occupied the computer for a whole day to herself.

<Content>A lovely hotel with really serious problems The Staff: (4/5) - friendly and helpful peopleThe Location: (2/5) - One the bright side, Amstelzicht is is good proximity to much that is interesting in Amsterdam. It is an eight minute walk east of the Bloemenmarkt. The location is severely hampered by the combination of a very busy road (Amstel) and a great deal of loud foot traffic by noisy drunks. Both the traffic noise andthe louts can last into the wee hours.The Room: (4/5) - featured excellent old wooden furniture. It was unusually spacious. A tiny refrigerator not intended for your actual use (holds the 3 euro soda). Had a decent bathroom with stand-up shower and average water pressure. The window blinds were dark enoughto allow a good sleep-in (valuable if the drunks keep you awake until3am)The Bed (2/5) - for a hotel of this cost, one might expect at least an average bed. The mattress was unworthy of a shabby college dormitory. The frame was pretty, but I'd have preferred some straw ina stable.The Hotel (2/5) - the pleasant interior of the hotel is nice to look at. But the hard floors and walls of the hallways are DREADFULLY loudwhen other guests are walking to their rooms. As it is, you'll hear every step and comment (BLAH! BLAH! BLAH! CLACK! CLACK! CLACK!!!...) of every guest as they chat merrily to their rooms after dinner. The Amenities (2/5) - no food available except the overpriced snacks in the minifridge. But many small and decent restaurants are nearby. The 'free wifi' provided to the hotel is basically non-existent. When the signal appeared it was non-functional.Until the Hotel shells out a little money for sound-deadening hallwayfeatures (like carpet and thicker doors and windows), the Hotel Amstelzicht should be avoided. At a minimum, insist on exploring your room before check-in.

<Content>Nice traditional hotel Stayed here for three nights at the beginning of March 2007. Very old traditional hotel. Dont expect 5 star and all the trimmings. It has no lift and very narrow steep stairs so its a big no no if you cant haul your bags up stairs or are disabled. Otherwise its in an excellent position overlooking the canals, very central behind the Rhembrant square so within easy stumbling distance of the night life. There is no breakfast available but there are places nearby especially along side the flower market which is five minutes walk. Remember, if youve had a late night, who cares about breakfast. The room we had was adequate in size, very clean, tea/coffee cable tv all you would expect. If you get a front looking room you will have a great view! Internet access was free. The staff where excellent, very helpfull and made us feel at home. All in all id go back without any hesitation. Only down side as i said was no breakfast and steep stairs.

<Content>Disastrous and rude! Upon arrival early on a Saturday evening our party of 2 couples requiring 2 rooms was told that due to an error made only the day before there was only 1 room available. Having booked months in advance we were disappointed to say the least to find they had double booked. We are told that the website we booked through had contributed to this mistake and we will be contacting them to complain. This double booking error was compounded by the attitude of the duty manager who called us 'unreasonable' and 'difficult' for making the justifiable request that the hotel arrange for us to have accomodation elsewhere for the full 3 nights of our stay. The best we were offered after much indignation on our part and plenty of uncomfortable incompetence from the duty manager was 2 nights at a hotel that was '2 mins away' for 2 nights and returning for a complementary final night at Amstelzicht. This may sound good but the arguments it took to get to this stage left a very sour taste. So we went off to our other hotel having agreed to pay the rate we would have done at Amstelzicht at what turned out to be a very nice and friendly hotel. The '2 mins away' turned out to be a half an hour walk in the pouring rain which was obviously not a great start to our Saturday night! We probably lost a good couple of hours of what should have been fun time in Amsterdam! So the saga continued upon arrival at the alternative hotel when they asked for poayment for the 2 nights stay at a more expensive rate that we had agreed to pay at Amstelzicht. They were well within their rights to do so but having been advised by Amstelzicht that this would not be the case we were miffed! The higher price was reflective of the standard of hotel it is important to say, it was lovely. We were not looking forward to going back to Amstelzicht for our final night but luckily we did not see the same member of staff who had been so rude to us and in fairness to the other people there they were courteous. Having been in fairly plush surroundings for 2 nights it was a shame to have to endure the grubby feeling and cold (however large suites) at the Amstelzicht. We certainly won't be rushing back here!

<Content>Hotel apartment for 4 We booked the hotel apt for 4 as we were travelling with 2 children ages 11 and 8. The hotel itself is next to the Amstel canal, and the apts are just down the street down a side alley. The location couldnt be beaten, and we had a fantastic time. However, I would definately not recommend the apt for 4 people. There is one small living room with 2 arm chairs and a table with 2 chairs. The bedroom has two single beds pushed together, and a seperate single bed pushed in the corner. There was also a tiny camp bed left in the middle of the sitting room to accomodate our youngest! As he was to afraid to sleep in a room on his own, we had all 4 beds crammed into the one bedroom and all had to clamber across each other during the night for the inevitable toilet trips!The apt was fine for 3 people, 3 if you dont mind sharing a bedroom. We have stayed in better and worse places, and basically just see our room as a place to crash, however if you have highter expectations, dont rent the apt!

<Content>Great location - really good staff - nice room This hotel has a fantastic location in the centre of Amsterdam. It's on a quiter road and so doesn't suffer from tram/traffic noise nor drunken tourists!The quality of the hotel for the amount they were charging was very good indeed. Contacting them directly we paid 鈧?80 for a 2-night weekend stay. We requested a quiet room and weren't disappointed. Rooms 11 and 12 up in the attic would appear to be the best (we had 12).Bed was spotless, bathroom was very clean, and the place had a generally well-looked-after feel. There was a (working!) safe in the room and all the usual services you require. Breakfast isn't included in the price but there's no end of good cafes to go to (Cafe de Jaren is particularly good - opposite the hotel across the river)It's not a super-classy boutique hotel but a very good bet for the money!

<Content>Delightful! My summer stay in Amsterdam at the Hotel Amstelzicht was delightful! I had a charming room that faced the Amstel Canal where I had a lovely view of boats travelling by and incredible architect of buildings across the canal. The hotel was conveniently situated within walking distance to all my favorite spots, cafes, shops, museums and galleries. The tram from Central Station drops you off literally steps away from the hotel. I was very impressed with the friendly english speaking staff. The owners Robert and Ramon were especially friendly and accomodating with ample suggestions from where to eat and what to see. As an avid traveller, I've never stayed at a place where I felt the owners of the hotel would mingle with their guests and make sure you were happy and comfortable. With that kind of service I would opt to stay at Hotel Amstelzicht everytime I come to Amsterdam. The rooms are neat, clean, spacious and had a touch of coziness with flowers. You can always spend a load of money and stay at one of the snooty fancy hotels, but my choice would be to stay somewhere cozy, friendly, clean and safe. This sweet, quaint little hotel is my choice. Thanks for the good memories Robert and Ramon and making me feel very welcome! Tot ziens!

<Content>Great Location ! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel for 3 nights (17-19 September) and I have given our overall experience an above average rating mainly because of the fantastic location of the hotel.We arrived at 11.20 pm at night, having emailed the hotel the day before to warn them of our late arrival. I cannot fault the Reception staff that were on duty during our stay, they were polite, friendly and helpful at all times.We negotiated the VERY steep and narrow stairs (I only take a size 5 ladies shoe and my full foot would not fit onto one of the stairs) up to our first floor room overlooking the canal at the front of the hotel (my husband had paid extra for this view). What we didn't appreciate when we booked a room with a view is that inbetwen the hotel and the canal is an extremely busy road (day and night). If peace and quiet is what you are after then do not book a room at the front of the hotel.The room in itself was large with high ceilings, but it did have a touch of shabbiness about it and the lighting in the room was so poor that it was hard to see at night. The following morning clarified what I thought, wallpaper peeling in the corner, threadbare bedspread and worn carpet.We paid 鈧?65 for 3 nights. The hotel is in need of some tlc but as mentioned before is in the right spot for sightseeing.

<Content>Brilliant! I loved this hotel and would recommend it! Its a two minute walk from shops, the flower market and other tourist places in Amsterdam. Inside is very clean, and the staff are friendly and speak very good English. The hotel was built sometime in the 17th century and you can still see some original features; this includes the staircases which are very steep, if you have difficulties with stairs then i would ask for a ground floor room when you book! I was staying on the third floor but the stay was worth the hike! If i was visiting Amsterdam for a second time i would definately stay here!

<Content>Good but a bit rundown Stayed in room 1 in the entry hallway in late May (avoid this room if possible due to noise from those entering and exiting). A spacious room (double bed, desk, sitting area) but a bit shabby (worn out carpet, stained bedspread, very soft mattress, etc.). It was bitter cold and we needed to ask for the heat to be turned on. The excellent and helpful receptionist handled this and all other requests promptly and courteously. The centrality of the location makes it desirable.

<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent value and great location! We stayed here for 3 nights in May with friends. We booked two double rooms, one canal view and one normal. The canal view room was lovely, spacious and the view was fantastic. The standard double didn't have the view but it was very comfortable and spacious and all you could ask for. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful, they booked excursions and helped us with directions around the city and were always happy to do so. The location was ideal, very close to everything you would want to see with a number of restaurants and cafe's within 5 mins walk of the front door. I did alot of research on cheaper hotels and it really paid off this time, you couldn't fault anything and we will definitely be going back!

<Content>Excellent Location and Value We stayed at the Hotel Amstelzicht April 10-12, 2006 after a week in London. We flew to Amsterdam from Heathrow and walked the 15 minutes to our hotel from Central Station. We arrived at 2PM and our triple room was ready. Our room was situated at the back of the hotel next to the reception desk (cannot recall the room number). However, this was preferential because there were only 4 stairs to get into the room. As the previous reviews have mentioned, the hotel stairs are very steep. This is worth mentioning because if you are considering this hotel, and cannot climb stairs, ask for this room.The room was very clean, but well-worn (as are most small European hotels), and the queen bed and pillows were comfortable. Note, however, that if you request a triple, the cot provided is very soggy and uncomfortable. There is a refrigerator in the room, but it is only to house the mini-bar contents. They ask that you do not put your own items in it. The view was not the best as it faced the rear of the building, but we did not spend that much time in our room. It was sufficient to let in some natural light and to check on the weather before going out.The hotel does not provide breakfast, but it does offer free coffee and tea during the morning for guests. Robert was very helpful providing change for taxis, restaurant recommendations and directions to various sights. The staff was always helpful and ready with a smile.The location of the hotel could not have been better. It sits facing the Amstel, and it is literally around the corner from the Rembrandtplein which has many restaurants and outdoor cafes. It is also in an ideal location from which to sightsee and explore.After some research and comparison, we booked directly through the hotel via the Internet and received a rate of about 200 Euro per night for a triple. We felt this was a good value for the price considering the location. Overall, we would recommend this hotel and definitely would stay here again.

<Content>Avoid apartments like the plague After reading several positive reviews of the Hotel Amstelzicht, I was looking forward to the stay in Amsterdam.Unfortunately how wrong!!!!!I had booked an apartment.....it was cold and dirty and backed onto a dark alleyway. When I approached the manager/owner he suggested that My partner and I wore warmer cloths even though at the time (because it was clold) we were wearing our jackets.We also ended up sleeping in them as well.The club next door kept us awake through to the very early hours of the morning. The Manager/owner was extremely rude and unhelpful.Thank goodness we were there only three days.

<Content>Great value, friendly staff This was the first stop of our honeymoon, and we very much enjoyed our stay at Amstelzicht. The staff were very welcoming and friendly, and we found the room to be satisfactory and clean. This is by no means a luxury hotel, but if you are looking for clean accomodations that present good value in Amsterdam, I highly recommend this hotel. The stairs are difficult to negotiate, so I would not recommend the hotel to those with physical disabilities. Otherwise though, we had a fabulous time, and there is a great restaurant just around the corner from the hotel.

<Content>My best stay ever Before arriving in Amsterdam, I have heard some terrible stories about Amsterdam hotels. However, I found Amstelzicht Hotel to be very welcoming and the staff were so friendly and accommodating.Their hospitallity is the greatest I have experience yet. The location of the hotel is excellent,very close to cafes, restaurants,shoppping malls and museums.Above all it is a very safe area to relax and walk around even at night.our room was absolutely huge (we got a triple room instead of a double).Although the bathroom was small but it was clean and manageable.I would like to thank the lovely staff at Hotel Amstelzicht for their fantastic service.Coming back again.

<Content>Fantastic accommodation The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service and friendly staff before. The appartment was great, it was clean, warm en there were beautifull flowers and fruit on te table. The appartment is also very suitable for little children.The bed was very comfortable en the bathroom luxury.The hotel is located perfectly, you can easily walk to the most beautifull places of Amsterdam. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in.

<Content>Stay Away from the Hotel Amstelzicht I am sorry to have to report an overall terrible experience at the Hotel Amstelzicht. I stayed at the Hotel Amstelzicht for three nights in a double room and found the accomodations to be on the scruffy (close to dirty) side. Hairs on the bedspread, cracked windowpanes in the hallway, worn down carpets and furnishings -- these were just a few of the damning little details. Our room faced a courtyard and every night I was kept awake by noise -- a nightclub on the Rembrantplein backs the courtyard on the other side. The oil painting hung in the room was pure kitsch. But a sense of malaise extends to the entire hotel. The lobby of the Amstelzicht resembles that of a police station or a public high school. This is not just a problem of decor -- it's also that one is being watched by highly visible video cameras (and from the lobby one can see the grainy black and white video display inside, behind the desk). Inside, the stairs are steep and badly carpeted, so beware if you have to climb with a suitcase. The breakfast room is utterly charmless, without windows. The rooms have notices posted inside stating that if you smoke marijuana in the room you will be charged an extra 200 euro to disinfect the room. I didn't want to smoke in the room, but I found the notice -- and the policy -- hyserically excessive. This is not an atmosphere of comfort and trust, and in no way is the hotel romantic, as advertized on the Amstelzicht's Web site. If you want a real three star hotel by a beautiful canal where the standards of cleanliness and service are impeccable, try the Hotel Singel. Or almost any other hotel in the immediate area. But my major problem was with the staff -- especially the two owners. We had booked two weeks in advance, but left after three days due to an incident of rudeness on the part of the co-owners. I won't go into detail, except to say that I've never experienced anything like it at a hotel. When I said I was leaving, they threatened to keep our entire American Express payment for the remaining days, whether or not they resold the room -- and, sad to say, they made good their promise, even though the room was listed on the Amstelzicht's Website just three days later (August 25th) as having been rebooked through the end of August(August is the busiest time of year for Amsterdam hotels, and this was a particularly busy August). Since we had paid in advance -- a naive gesture of trust -- American Express could not refund our money. The sum was about two thousand dollars. So, beware of the Hotel Amstelzicht.

<Content>Perfect spacious apartment We stayed in an apartment of Amstelzicht, which was beautiful and quite spacious, especially for Amsterdam. The whole hotel was very nice decorated and very comfortable. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. This place is a fantastic value. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>comfortable room We had a wonderful time in Amstelzicht. The staff was very helpful, by check in they gave us all the information we needed. Everything was very close to the hotel. The room smelt fresh and was very clean. A nice large bed and good shower. We liked the fact that we realy felt home, afer a day of walking we were able to relax in our comfortable room. We will be back.

<Content>The best place to stay in Amsterdam! My first visit to Amsterdam was made even better by this great hotel. Since we arrived at the hotel we have been treated very nicely by the staff. We arrived around 9.00 am at the hotel. The reception clerk probably noticed that we were very tired from an overnight flight and he offered us a nice cup of coffee before checking in. Later we discovered that free coffee is offered every morning!We were able to leave the luggage until we could check in to our room. By the way the staff was very helpful with carrying the luggage to our room, which was at the top floor. The room has all facilities we needed, was nicely decorated and it has a splendid view on the Amstel Canal. One day it was raining the whole day, fortunately the hotel offered big golf umbrellas! Resuming, a nice hotel with reasonable prices in the center of Amsterdam.

<Content>Great Location, Nice Staff The Amstelzicht was a really nice place to stay. The room smelled like smoke, but we didn't specify a non-smoking room. There's free internet, the staff is friendly, and the room was large and clean. Overall, a very pleasant experience. Also it's located close to EVERYTHING, seriously. Conveniently located on tram lines and the metro, too, if you're not up to walking. I really couldn't get over how close it was to everywhere we wanted to go!

<Content>Location, Location, Location..... Location is key! I travel to Amsterdam 3 times a year and stay at this lovely, quaint, reasonably priced hotel on the canal overlooking the Amstel. Conveniently located, right smack dab in the middle of anywhere you'd want to be- but far enough away from the noisy streets. Be prepared to take a tram from the Centraal Station to their hotel it's a quick and easy 7 minute ride on the tram, just ask the guys when you book the hotel which tram number to take (1.60 euro for the tram vs. 20.00 euro if you take a cab- major rip off). The flower market, the shopping districts, great restaurants and beautiful sites are all in walking distance. I usually stay in one of their apartment style rooms- they vary in decor. Always greeted with fresh flowers and equipped with all amenities and a rather large bathroom (not standard for Euro hotels). If you are traveling during the winter months, don't worry about heating. It's quite cozy and comfortably warm in the rooms that I've stayed in. The english speaking staff is friendly and the owners, Robert and Ramon are wonderful hosts making sure your stay is pleasant! I can't wait for my next trip out. I don't ever have to think of where to book a room. When I go to Amsterdam I know to book Hotel Amstelzicht!

<Content>Really enjoyed out stay. We've just come back from staying at the Hotel Amstelzicht and we have a lovely time. It's near everything (I suppose everything in Amsterdam is near!!) so it's really handy. The staff couldn't be nicer. Big Hellos when we came in every day and 'Have a Lovely Day's when we were leaving every morning. I would recommend this place to people who want a base in Amsterdam as there's no dining facilities here, but not to people with any kind of walking difficulties. The stairs are quite steep!

<Content>Amazing apartment We stayed in a top floor canal view apartment which far exceded our expectations.The apartment was very spacious, comfortable and clean and it had every facility you could want.The hotel staff were very helpful and we really couldn't fault the place or the staff. The hotels location is fantastic and the views from the apartment were really really amazing!Highly recommended for a comfortable and stylish Amsterdam break.Mary  Ian, England.

<Content>Look for hidden charges, fine print and swapping reserved rooms. If you want to be charged ridiculous amounts for unspoken rules, be moved to an upgraded room that is not what you reserved, or simply stay in a loud hotel where you don't sleep, stay here. We were told we were getting an upgrade and instead were taken down the street to a room that required us to climb 3 sets of very steep stairs with heavy bags. Only after asking for the manager to put us in the room we actually reserved and had checked into only 3 hours before, we were moved back to our original room. We took a water out of the mini bar and after we returned home, we were charged $21 for the water and a service charge for not telling them we took the water. We expected this hotel to be run like any other hotel we stayed in during our European travels and charge us for the water when they check the minibar, not be punished with a hefty fine for not telling them. There is also a restaurant behind the hotel. It is loud when they take out the trash late at night. Just Don't do it.

<Content>Great for people who don't sleep It started off well, nice room, nice view.Then it turned dark an sleep was needed but it just dosen't happen.We were in room 1 where you are expected to be a door man for the whole hotel, besides people not being able to open the door (they think rattling it for half an hour will work) they think knocking on your window at 3 am is ok.Staff just nod when you tell them, so before you go refuse room 1 if you like sleep.

<Content>Cozy and Private I was vacation with my wife and our 1yr old daughter, we had reservations with the Best Western just down the street but after our stay there we decided to stay in A-dam for an aditional 3 days, since BW was booked we had to look for a new hotel.We walked down the street to the first place we found and which happened to be the Hotel Amstelzicht. The clerk was very friendly and we ended up checking in to one of their appartment rooms that turned out to be fabulous. For the same price of the crappy BW room we got a room with a huge kingsized bed, a living room with 2 chairs and satelite t.v, a kitchennette including a fridge and a microwave and a coffe maker with coffee and an asortment of tea.The bathroom was the only mediocre thing about this place, it was clean and all but the shower was small and it was just a shower head comming out of the wall with a curtain around it. The location was perfect too, walking distance to everything.This place is just aweome, i wish we could of stayed there the whole time.If this place is good enough for me and my family then its good enough for you! I'll be back for sure!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I had booked the Amstelzicht Hotel via the Internet for a 3 night stay on the way back home after visiting Paris. The hotel was very good, The museums, restaurants and so on were all within easy walking distance. The rooms were more than adequate, clean, cool, new and quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful and in the morning there was free coffee in the lobby. Great to start your day. Would I stay there again, yes if I visit Amsterdam again.

<Content>Good Value Me and my husband stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. I was not too imprested, but it was an OK value. The room was very big to the european standards with a sitting area, but the furniture is very old and it was dusty. I wasn't using the wardrobe or any other storage areas, because I felt if I'll touch it, it will fall apart. Bathroom was very clean and nice. Overall it was a good stay, because Amsterdam is a very nice city with a lot of fun to do and see and we did not spend a lot of time in the room at all.Be careful if you're buying it in US, because the prices were listed in both currencies, but we were not charged upfront, and at the checkout when they converted Euros to USD is was much more than advertised.The location of the hotel was good. 20 minutes walk to the Centraal Station and walking distance to all the attractions and museums. We were not using the tram, because it is a lovely city to walk around.

<Content>Great place, little gem This is a great find. I checked out many, many hotels on the internet before making a booking and was glad I did my homework. It's central to absolutely everything, the rooms are lovely and the staff are friendly. Ask for room number one, it's huge and has two chandelers and its on the ground floor so there are no steep stairs to negotiate after a few drinks. If your going to Amsterdam you should definitely stay here.

<Content>Avoid like the Plague Have traveled to Amsterdam over 10 times and never stayed in anywhere so TERRIBLE. The rooms were tiny (2 beds in 1 room and 3 in another). The bed was for someone aged 5 or under and the views of a concrete wall were awful. After checking out i was told i had to clean my own room which i did and then 1 week later was charged and extra 150 euros for what i don't know. I'm persuing legal action so avoid this place like the plague.

<Content>If you are looking for fun times - Look elsewhere Booked a room for me and two friends for a Xmas vacation getaway. Before we were even in the room they began with RULES! No smoking (Ok we heard him and granted thier request begrudgingly) ALWAYS LEAVE KEY (didn't make me happy to leave the key to my room) We unpacked and settled what we had. We decided to go out and hit a coffee shop. We returned about 2 hours later - walked in room and there was a huge stand alone air purifier and the windows all were open in the room (our room had a giant picture with windows that butted up against an alley way) I asked why was our room entered he advised me that we were not to smoke in the room. I kindly advised him that no one smoked in the room (maybe our clothes smelled) and that the window is open and between the 3 of us had valuables in the room. I told him that I wanted to speak with Managment. Basically this place is horribly ran by someone who doesn't have a CLUE what even a little bit of customer service is. Bottom line is the entire time I felt unwelcommed and had a feeling like I was staying in a prison to a degree having to check with them every move made. OH THE ALLEY WAY THE HOTEL BACK UP TO EMPTIES THEIR EMPTY BOTTLES EARLY AND IS EXTREMELY LOUD DUMPING THEM INTO VARIOUS BINS!!! NO FUN TO BE HAD AT AMSTELZICHT. Location is good that was it. Visited Amsterdam many times and stayed various places throughout the city and this was the most unpleasant one, by far.

Beds were not perfect but comfortable, bathroom seemed renovated and was very clean. Breakfast was very tasty and enough. We would definetely recommend this hotel.
