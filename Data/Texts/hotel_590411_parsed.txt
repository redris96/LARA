<Content>There must be better places than this..... I booked the Del Comte after seeing the reviews on Trip Advisor. The location is fine, but I found the hotel depressing and the staff unhelpful. The 2 rooms we booked both had windows facing onto a drab internal courtyard. The rooms are dark, basic and despite switching rooms twice, the 'Non Smoking' rooms all stank of both stale and recent smoke. Very unpleasant. When we complained about the smell the concierge shrugged and said 'they are Non Smoking rooms. If someone chooses to smoke in them, what can I do? I have no other rooms.' No apology - nothing. Incidentally, the Non Smoking rooms have ashtrays in them so I guess clean ashtrays = Non Smoking, whilst dirty ashtrays = smoking. The same employee was also supremely unhelful to another guest who asked for the number of the Spanish operator while I was waiting to change rooms. Same shrug, same lack of care. Avoid the Del Comte.

<Content>Highly Recommended We stayed at Hotel del Comte last month for 2 nights. They spoke English, were helpful with questions and had free wi-fi in the room. The room was new, immaculate and quiet. Location couldn't have been better. It was a 10-15 minute walk to Las Ramblas. The area is quiet and safe at all hours. There is a grocery store around the corner. It's 2 blocks from the metro and two blocks from the Aerobus to/from the airport. We arrived close to midnight, check-in was painless and went out for a stroll over to Las Ramblas which was still awake at that hour and felt safe on the main streets. I would stay here again in a minute. Don't expect the Hilton, this is a business travelers hotel with minimal frills, but for us, was perfect!

<Content>Great Stay!! Just finished a 3 night break at the Hotel Del Comte and i do not have a bad word to say about the hotel. Metro is a 2 minute walk where you can get to anywhere in the city within 20minutes. Rooms are very modern and clean. Area is quiet at night and only 5 minute walk to centre for shopping and nightlife.

<Content>2min walk from Metro, Free internet and next door to a Supermarket! Need I say anymore. This hotel was small and new but the rooms were clean, decorated perfectly with flat screen tvs nice furniture and a great bathroom.Yes the rooms are a bit small and do not have views, however the room is pleasant to stay in and you are literally a 2 minute walk from the Metro station. There is a supermarket next door which sells everything. The only down fall about the hotel is that breakfast is not usually included and if you are room only, then it cost 10 euros per person or more, which really is too much. Also free internet too, so you can check out places you wish to go to.

<Content>Nice stay Very well situated, metro station 5 min. on foot, Ramblas/Av. Diagonal/Montjuic in 15 minutes on foot. Nice and safe area. Our room was new, small, essential, with telephone and TV. No panoramic view from the window, actually only a wall with other room windows. Everything was clean. We can confirm what has been said about the thin walls, bring your ear plugs with you if you do not have a heavy sleep. Did not try the breakfast buffet as we found it overpriced. You can have a decent breakfast in any of the numerous bar-cafes in the surroundings.

<Content>Very comfortable Me and my boyfriend, we stayed at the hotel over the weekend in january and were very satified. the staff was helpful, giving us information about the city, the rooms (also bathrooms) were clean and modern. the hotel is situated in the centre, so that you can walk to some of the tourist attractions.

<Content>Amazing for a 2 star hotel!! Was slightly concerned when this was a two star but read reviews which were good so booked it - at a good price compared to everywhere else in Barcelona! Was extremely pleased with the hotel. Reception were welcoming and helpful in immediately giving us a map and explaining best places to go. The rooms were very clean, modern and spacious. It is only 20 minutes pleasant walk from the centre (top of las ramblas), or there is the metro round the corner - or a taxi is about 10 euros. There was free internet access. Only grumble is the noise from the street - you could hear noise from the street most of the night as it was double glazing not triple glazing but this seems to be pretty much the norm in Barcelona from reading other reviews in other hotels.

<Content>Hotel Comte average, but good location for the price Book via their own website. US based hotels.com or others do not seem to work with this hotel. The hotel is about a 12 minute walk to Placa Catalunia, the center of Barcelona. The price and quality is a good deal. I recommend it. Rooms were good, and the noise is lower than average for most downtown Barcelona hotels. Overall, a very good deal, especially during the week. I recommend booking it if under 100 euros per night.

<Content>We saw Ronaldinho! I was impressed with the Hotel. It is in a great location, just around the corner from Urgell Metro stop. At night when the metro closes after mid night it only cost us 鈧? in a taxi from La Ramblas. Even though the Hotel is Fairly central, it is very quiet and not once during our 3 nights was I disturbed by traffic or noise. The bathrooms are great and also have a bath which is perfect for relaxing in after walking all day. Comparing it other places I have stayed for the same price or even more expensice, this place wins hands down. The highlight of our stay however was when we were checking in, the football star Ronaldinho was sitting in the lounge waiting for his ride!!

<Content>Great hotel for the price I stayed at this hotel with my wife for 6 days in december 2006. We book directly with the hotel through its website and had no problems on check-in. The hotel exceeded our expectations given it's 2 star rating. Our room was modern, clean, spacious and well maintained on a daily basis. The staff was very friendly and professional and as black people travelling in continental europe for the first time we appreciated this. We had breakfast at the hotel as we were granted a deal which saw us pay 5 euros per person per day. This turned out to be conveniet and great value for money. Naturally, breakfast was of the continental variety and it was quite adequate for us. There was always a plentiful supply of eggs, cold meats, cheeses, jams, bread, coffe, tea, hot chocolate etc.The location of the hotel is ideal. It is located within walking distance of the placa catalunya and las ramblas. This location gives you the benefit of easy access to the centre of activity and the peace and quiet necessary for good night's sleep. The hotel is also located literally metres from the urgell metro station which you may not use much because so many of barcelona's attractions can be reached by foot from this location. Additionally, the airport bus which takes passengers from the airport to the city centre stops within 100 metres of the hotel (urgell stop). However, on the return journey it is adviseable to take the bus from placa catalunya on account of the availability of space.We had a great stay in Barcelona and can't wait to return. Ofcourse, on our retun we will be staying at the Hotel Del Comte.

<Content>Great price for a 2 star hotel Stayed here for 5 nights in August on our first visit to Barcelona. As it was during peak season, had difficulty finding a decent hotel that would not break the budget. Was pleasantly surprised with Hotel Del Comte, especially considering it only had 2 stars when we stayed. The rooms had been obviously newly renovated and were quite large for European standards. All furnishings were new, including a flat screen tv. Large bathroom too with all the necessities (hair dryer etc). Our room was very clean and we had no problems if extra towels were needed. The breakfast was fairly standard....cereals, tea coffee, fruit etc. Did not try the hot food. Probably suggest getting breakfast in a small cafe though - better value for money. Staff were polite and helpful. We liked the location, mainly because it was in a good area and not near Ramblas. Only a short walk though into the centre, otherwise the metro is a few hundred meters around the corner. I know there website says that the airport shuttle leaves from across the road (or very nearby), however the hotel staff did not know about this when we asked and suggested we get a cab instead. We took the train to the airport, as we still had trips left on our metro 10 trip card. You only have to change trains once, but depending on the time of day, it may be a hassle if trains are crowded. All in all, would stay here again and recommend this hotel!

<Content>only beans hot breakfast was ok except the beans were the only warm thing in the hot plate and the airconditioning in the breakfast room meant you needed a jacket apart from that no too bad for three day stay why they cant have a automatic card reader to open front door to hotel beats me it would save night duty manager keep getting up to open the front door when guests have a late/early night out

<Content>Highly Recommended. Can't wait to go back Just returned from my first trip to Barcelona. Spent 2 days and can't wait to go again. Thinking of booking up in July!This hotel was a reasonable rate and had everything you could wish for. 10 mins walk from the main square, shops and restaurants. Modern decor, extremely clean. Great breakfast. No bar and I don't think lunch/dinner are offered. However, I'd imagine most travellers will be out all day and these facilities are catered for elsewhere. I would also recommend Tapa Tapa for a great place to eat, good atmosphere and great service.

<Content>Great hotel, but beware third-party bookings This is a *great* little hotel and way above my expectations for the price. The renovation is pretty much complete and the rooms are squeaky clean and new, with modern glass, steel and marble bathrooms, flat panel TV, free wireless, etc -- they could probably charge three times the price, call it a boutique hotel and get away with it! The location in Eixample is excellent, just 50m from Urgell metro/Aerobus station and a reasonable stroll away from Placa Catalunya/Rambla. Contrary to what a previous poster said, there are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity and a very cheap supermarket too, but no noisy nightlife (a good thing in my book). All that said, the walls are a little on the thin side, so if you have zero tolerance for traffic noise or gurgling pipes this is not the place for you (and you probably shouldn't be staying anywhere in the city center!).Now one warning: I booked on lastminute.com a good three days before my arrival, but they had no sign of my booking and it was only good luck that they had a room free for me. (My prepaid booking was accepted as payment though.) Book through their own site directly instead.

<Content>OVERBOOKING Problem I did not stay at this hotel, I had just booked a room with a booking site. When I arrived to the hotel, 2 hours later, they told me that they had no free rooms since the day before.They helped me to find another hotel for the night ( many hotels were full that night) but Idon't think I will book again this hotel for my next stays in Barcellona.

<Content>another nice stay i stayed for two nights in one single room, very spacious, recently furnished, air conditioned system perfectly running (really essential considering it was july!). few minutes from the metro station, the location is in a quiet area (i used to walk alone around there by night, and - so to speak - i'm a damned pretty girl! ;-) and i never had any kind of trouble). by the way, the neighborhood does not offer good pubs, bars or restaurant, so better go to the town center to eat/drink something.

<Content>Booking fraud We have just returned from Barcelona trip to find out that we are charged for stay in Del Comte hotel even we never came close to it. We booked on-line three nights in Del Comte but there was no available double room for last two days. So I gave a try to phone directly Del Comte hotel. After 15 min discussion, representative found a room, I gave her my card information and shortly after that received an e-mail with booking details. To my big surprise, booking was not what I was asking for - instead of one room for two they booked two single rooms. I wrote back immediately that we need one room for two. Reply was that there is no double room available and, that all they have are two single. I didn't want that so I didn't confirm the booking and eventually found other hotel in Barcelona.When I returned from vacation, my visa statement showed Del Comte Hotel charged me for 2 single rooms. I phoned the hotel - they said this is not their mistake, I have to speak with the booking agent which is actually from Apsus Hotels. I had to do number of overseas phone calls, wait on the reply. All I was getting from them was that I made the reservation and they see no problem charging me. To cut the long story short, I have to go now through Visa resolution process that hopefully will result in reverting the charges in my favor. It is very difficult to deal with Del Comte people, they simply don't care. Be aware of this hotel and even don't try to contact them. As it happened to me, your phone call inquiry can be considered as booking.

<Content>Great find in a good location Spacious room, large bed, good bathroom with shower over bath and all spotlessly clean. But paper-thin walls. The hotel is in sensible walking distance from the central Playa, and very handy for the airport bus service. Breakfast was extra on our room-only deal at 9 Euros each, per day. Excellent quality food, very wide choice including fresh fruits, cold meats and cheeses, plus a good range of hot drinks. The staff are very helpful and all those we spoke to had excellent English - much better than our Catalonian! We stayed there in September 2005 and thought it excellent value for money, and a really good standard.
