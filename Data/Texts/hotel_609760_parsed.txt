<Content>Great Location, Helpful Staff, Unimpressive Rooms We stayed at the Vincci Arena in early October for five days. The hotel is located near the Espanya Metro stop, the Bullfighting Ring and the Pillars of Parliament. We were also within walking distance of a fabulous dinner  Flamenco Show at Spanish Town.Things we liked: personable  helpful staff, hotel location central to the metro, bountiful breakfast, lots of storage space for personal items in the bathroom, lots of little stores, tapas bars and restaurants nearby.Things we didn't like: Eery green neon hallways, rock-hard bed (like sleeping on a box-spring!), dark purple out-of-scale furniture and decorations that made the room feel dark and oppressive, noisy garbage trucks at 3:30 am, boisterous people out on the streets at 5 am.We were traveling to three countries over five weeks. This was among our least favorite hotels. The location could not be beat, but we would probably look for a different hotel in the same vicinity if we were to stay in Barcelona again.

<Content>Good value in Barcelona The hotel is well located near the metro and several bus stops. The hotel itself is very modern with good sized rooms and bathrooms both of which are very clean. Decor makes the rooms feel very dark but we were never there lon so this was not a problem. Several cafes very nearby that all did a simple breakfast of croissant, juice and coffee. All in all this is a great little hotel a bus/metro ride away from central barcelona (10 - 15 mins). It is also safe to travel back too at night.

<Content>"Marvelona" We booked this hotel after having read the reviews about it, rating it as an excellent hotel.When we arrived there we were impressed at how modern and welcoming it was. Check in was very easy, we tried our hand at catalonian but the staff spoke excellent english. The rooms are the best hotel rooms i have ever stayed in. They have mood lighting, brilliantly decorating and to a very high standard.The hotel is very close to the magic fountain and to the main train station, barcelona sants, 5 minute walk. The closest metro station was tarragona and it took less than 10 minutes to get to the bottom of las ramblas. Metro is very cheap, a t-10 ticket will get you 10 tickets for 7euros. metro is very easy to and convenient to use.Hotel bar was reasonably priced, glass of wine 鈧?. Mini bar in the rooms was even reasonably priced. We had breakfast at the restaurant and 鈧?6 was a lot to pay per person but the food was very good and you got a very good start to the day.I couldn't fault this hotel at all. Was fun to stay in, close enough to town, just what we wanted

<Content>Modern Chic but far from centre We stayed at Vincci Arena for 3 nights in August 2008. The room was very clean, but the air conditioning was very cold and couldn't be turn down. The deco is stylish, and the reception was very helpful as well. We tried the massage in the hotel but was a waste of money, it felt like a rub more than a massage. The hotel is located near Espanya metro station, which is far from the main town centre (old town and La Rambla). Is not walkable distance, so must take public transport. I didn't feel it was value for money because of the location.

<Content>Roof Top View - with Sunshine Myself and my girlfriend stayed in the hotel from a Thursday to Monday! - We upgraded our room the night before we arrived and it was well worth it!I had been to Barcelona before and stayed in La Rambla and swore I wouldn't stay there again (noise) The Vincci Hotel is in a great location and the subway is a mere 5 min walk away. Taxis are pretty cheap and it was about 6 euro during the day to get to La Rambla.The Arena hotel is about 20mins by the Airport Coach, just get off at Placa de Espana (do not take a taxi from where u are dropped off, we were ripped off by one who pretended not to know that the hotel was about 2 blocks away) which is about a 5 min walk away!Back to the Hotel, the room with the jacuzzi on the roof was amazing, I agree with another poster that the hallways are VERY warm and you really wouldn't want to be waiting on your lift for long! - The hotel is very modern and the bathroom was pretty spacious!It was a shame there was no Iron in the room and I did think 鈧?2 for a pay per view movie was a little expensive.There is a great coffee shop around the corner facing the Placa de Espana (very friendly staff and lots of choice)I would stay here again and would highly recommend the upgrade to the suite with the jacuzzi - its AMAZING!!!

<Content>Great, very modern We booked via LastMinuite.com and got a good deal on this 4 start hotel for 5 nights. We managed to obtain basicaly the same price as some of the 2-3 star places in the 'centre' of Barcelona. We were glad we did, since the Centre is really the tourist centre, and often loud into the night.This hotel's location was a big sell and we found it a huge plus. It is just seconds or a minutes walk from the nearest metro station and 2 minuits to Place De Spania, and so the Magic Fountains etc. Terrific! The hotel is not on a main road, and out window looked out to a side street so was quiet most of the time.The room was always cleaned very well every day. The shower was great. We had very efficient Air-Con, a TV which, for the english speakers, had CNN, CBS, BBC-World, and UK Sky News (you have to keep going up on the channels!). Also gernman MTV, lots of spanish TV, some French Channels etc.One problem with the room, it was not a double bed but two singles pushed together. The beds were very comfy however. There was lots of storage, a fridge/minibar and safe.My real issue was with the soap. I am sorry, this really annoyed me! One tiny bar of saop was not enough every day for two of us, it really was tiny, about 2 cm square and less than 1cm thick. One day we returned to find no soap at all! I had to go to reception and get more.Our price didn't include breakfast, and we asked how much this was. 16 euro pp!! I actualy laughed out loud when we established this was not even for the two of us. There are several nice cafe's near by. My tip, head stright out of the hotel down the slide road looking road, turn left towards Place De Spania, and there is a bakery on the left. Great coffee, sweet and savoury pastries.will stay here again for the right price.That said in 6 days we saw everything barcelona had to offer, so we won't be back too soon!

<Content>A little bit strange... I'll keep this short and sweet.Arrived at the hotel to find a large group checking in, we presumed the worst and thought it would be a while until we check in, however the dilligent management took our details and we were sorted out in no time. The hotel looks a little quirky and stylish on the inside so the first impressions were good.We went down for dinner only to find three of the many tables were made up, this was slighty disconcerting - was the hotel quiet? Were they not expecting to do much business... Anyway my food was bland and my partners was an over-priced and under-cooked chewy stake.We didn't bother having breakfast at the hotel as there were couple of decent cafes on the walk down to Placa Espanya where you can get a decent coffee and a pastry for a couple of Euros.We did order room service a couple of times - this menu was actually better than the restaurant menu! The food was alright, a little bland again, though for room service the price was reasonable.With regards to the room, at first glance it seemed very nice. The only real problems were a little wear and tear and the tv didn't work properly.I think the Japanese Garden is massively disappointing, it's some giant plastic flowers and some white stone... Hmm.Not much more to say, the price was okay, a little on the expensive side given the location and the lack of facilities. Next time I'll try and get a hotel closer the Place Catalunya (city centre) as most of the decent eateries are in this area.

<Content>Loved the hotel, staff and location The airport bus (1 stop from the airport) dropped us close to the hotel (400m) from Placa d Espanya, situated on a very quiet back street but close to two metro stations (the best way to get around).Upon arrival we had to get the paperwork out to check that there had not been a mistake on the price as it far exceeded our expectations.We used a three day metro ticket to travel around, it was so easy, and the hotel gave us advice and a map.We were very close to the Magic Fountains, the tourist bus stops and Crue Coberta shopping street.The only negative was the lack of places to eat and drink but we did find an Asian restaurant with no English spoken and had a great buffet meal, better that we had in the port at a fraction of the price as it was where the locals ate, 50m from the hotel.The room was great with a large bed, a decent bathroom and a cheap mini-bar.

<Content>Good Hotel, Average Location The rooms were great, larger than your average European hotel room. The room was nicely decorated and had a modern feel. Bathrooms are especially spacious. Bright green lit up numbers guide you to your room from the dimly lit hallways, nice touch I thought. the beds aren't the most comfortable but they're definitley above average, same with the pillows. Our room was located on an inner courtyard so we didn't hear any noise what so ever. The location is not fantastic. It's not walking distance to anything a typical tourist would want to see, however a two block stroll will get you to a metro stop(Barcelona's metro is very user friendly and goes everywhere you would need to go). Overall I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff was friendly and helpful in our brief encounters.

<Content>Amazing Hotel Stayed in this hotel with my girlfriend in April 2008, to celebrate my birthday. Check-in was swift, and we got the key to room 703. Upon arrival in our room we discovered the nice surprise that we had been upgraded (when asked we were told that the hotel was quite full) to one of the two suites in the hotel. Read review below for specifics. Watching the sunset in our private jacuzzi whilst drinking cava on my birthday was brilliant.The staff at the front desk were amazing. The restaurants they recommended us were brilliant and they were all more than willing to point out directions, highlight things on our map, etc. I will definitely go back to Vincci Arena for a next stay in Barcelona. No doubts about that.

<Content>Wonderful Honeymoon Hotel Stayed at this hotel in April 08 and had the most amazing visit. We arrived at the hotel after a long walk (we had missed our stop on with the airport bus - it really is the first stop and if no one else moves don't panic!!) to be told that there was good news and bad news. The bad news was that the whole of Barcelona had experienced a water problem so our room wasn't ready but the good news was that we had been upgraded as the hotel was aware that we were on our honeymoon. Roman on the front desk was fantastic, he took our luggage to keep it safe and recommended a restaurant where we could get lunch and a beer whilst we waited for our room to be ready. He also talked us through a map of Barcelona pointing out places that would be worth a visit.After lunch we returned to the hotel and our luggage was already in our room so they gave us a key and we went up to 701. It was amazing, we had our own terrace with table, chairs and a jacuzzi. The hotel had also sent up Champagne on ice for us. The room was spacious, the terrace amazing and the bathroom out of this world. It was all spotless.All the staff at the hotel were so helpful during our stay. We had the breakfast on our last day before heading back to the airport and although slightly expensive there was a huge amount of choice. We also had a drink one night in the lounge and that, along with the mini bar, was very reasonable.If I ever went back to Barcelona I would stay at this hotel. The location out of town was nice as it meant you could get away from the hustle and bustle if you wanted to but the underground into Las Ramblas was so easy it wasn't an effort. The pick pocketing is bad, we were fortunate as we left unscathed, others weren't so lucky. Just make sure you don't put your wallet in an easily accessible pocket and hold onto your hand bag.

<Content>Great hotel! Lovely hotel! Found this hotel through expedia originally, then looked it up on google and discovered tripadvisor.com. Read the reviews, and ultimately chose it because they were positive and indicated that it was in a good location. And definitely met my expectations! Located minutes away from Plaza Espanya. Took the Aerobus to the hotel by getting off at the 1st stop, which is Plaza de Espanya. then found the hotel in no time. I originally went to aerobus's official website to check out a map of the region and easily found Consell de Cent on it, drew it out before I left for my flight, and then easily found it once I arrived. Check in was easy. Arrived at 11ish and check-in was at 2. So they kept our luggages for us in the office next to the check in counter, and we then went to walk around outside for a bit and get to know the area. Afterwards, we got back at like 1:30 and our bags were all up in our room already. We were on the 6th floor facing a street. No problems with noise at all. Pretty quiet neighborhood in my opinion. Rooms are nice. 2 twin beds pushed together though. Lighting and decor is lovely. Toiletries in bathroom. Room and bathroom cleaned every day. Must leave towels in bathtub to get new towels every day. Never any issues really. Watched CNN+, which is the spanish CNN every morning to check out the weather and news.There is a supermarket called (Hipermarket) a couple blocks away. Ask the front desk and they will tell you. Also, nearby, there is Cafe Nou, as others have reported, as well as a cheap internet cafe, where I also bought a 5euro phone card to call back to the US. There is the little store run by an Indian guy nearby as well. But can get more and cheaper if you get to the supermarket. Bought juice and stored it in the mini fridge in the hotel.Hotel is only a few stops away from all major tourist attactions by metro. It really is in the most ideal location. The Aerobus to get back to the airport is also very close to the part of Plaza de Espanya near the hotel. Essentially, it's at this little stop that is across from the Hotel de Catalunya (I think that's what it was... basically the big hotel right on the Plaza) just off the sidewalk and directly across from the metro stop. No need to cross many streets. You will see a sign at the bus stop that says Aerobus.Staff at hotel were great. They could speak English pretty well as well. I think I remember a blond haired man (Ramon?) and woman, who spoke English well and were pretty helpful. On the last night, I wanted some bath soap b/c the cleaning service didn't leave any and also another hand towel. The front desk told me it'd be up in my room immediately. And sure enough someone brought it up in a few minutes. Would definitely stay at this hotel again if I was in Barcelona. Actually wished that I could have explored the area around a bit more and enjoyed the hotel more, but was always out and about site-seeing. Oh, and yes there is a fitness room, but it only has 2 bikes and 1 treadmill. There are a sauna and steam room, as well as showers. Never used any of these facilities as I never had the time. But they were clean and nicely laid out.Overall great.

Rooms were large and the bed very comfy.Hotel has lots of facilities such as a gym and spa where you can have a turkish bath. The area the hotel is based is quiet with a few restaurants hidden around the back streets. Local subway is 5 minutes away and hotel is 4 train stops to La Ramblas.Would return again.

Staff very friendly and most spoke very good English. didn鈥檛 use the bar or restaurant but both looked very nice and the mini bar in the rooms are surprisingly cheap which is good to have a drink before a night out in the centre.

<Content>Loved this Hotel Stayed here in on our Honeymoon after our cruise ended in Barcelona. Hotel was very clean, spacious, and the rooms were very modern. At first we thought this hotel was in a distant area when were first booked it but it turned out to be great. The metro/subway station was within walking distance. I would recommend this hotel to any traveler.I am the type of traveler that is always concerned about a hotel's cleanliness and this hotel exceeded my expectations. I also look for convenient location and this hotel is a mile from Las Ramblas which is where the cafes and tourist area. Only 1 or 2 stops of the metro.

<Content>Terrific Place We recently returned from a 3 week holiday and we stayed at the Vincci Arena for 4 days. It was one of the better experiences we had. The front desk folks were great. Very accomodating and helpful. We asked for a quiet room and had absolutely no difficulty with external noise. Although it is true that you can hear people opening and closing their doors. The room was well designed and very clean.We loved the location. We were very close to the Olympic Site and the Miro Art Gallery. It's a 20min walk to Las Rambals.One of the cheapest and best Tapas places is just 2 blocks away, the hotel will direct you to this quaint little place (a couple of blocks from the main Train Station). Our favourite place to eat was the fish bar/kiosk in the BACK/Centre of the Market. Go early, everything starts to shut down around 3pm. The other great place is in the old town....CAL PEP. Utterly fantastic. Tips: If you're coming from the airport...take the bus directly across from the information centre in the airport...the bus is very inexpensive a few Euro's and get off at the first stop,,,Plaza Espania...the hotel is only 2 blocks away... it could not have been easier. Avoid taxis every time we took one it was a hassle...overcharging...taking us on unnecessary long routes etc.All the stuff people say about thefts and scams are true. We met several people who had been robbed, at the train station and on Las Rambalas. Also, on Las Rambalas there is a group of Russian scam artists...one guy has 3 containers with a ball under one container...the idea is that you are to guess which ball is under a particular container. If you guess right they give you money. The scam is that they have their friends pose as tourists are 'winning' alot of money. Then real tourist take a turn, they first win a few Euros and as the wager get higher ie $100 Euros then suddenly you lose and they all run away...with your money.

The breakfast selection is huge and the food was great also. rooms are very tidy and clean and also very cosy and comfortable. would definetely stay at this hotel once again since it's very close to the metro were you could get the train and go wherever you want. So it was definetely a good choice we made. It's hotel website shows pictures of the hotel which look exactly like it does in real life.

<Content>thieves at hotel vincci arena Stealing of your property, lying, hiding and eventually neglecting the very fact of the property existence 鈥?are all the 鈥榥ice things鈥?you will face in Hotel Vincci Arena. We came there for our honeymoon, and it was the worst hotel experience that we鈥檝e ever had. We travel a lot on business 鈥?working for a big international company in Russia - and for vacations, and we鈥檝e never met hotel crew that irresponsible and merely mean. We came to the hotel right from our wedding, therefore we had with us the glasses that were given to us as a gift by our parents. They were not cheap, of course, but not extremely expensive 鈥?we had our clothes and other things that cost more in the room - so we didn鈥檛 think of putting them in the safe. We were using them sometimes having a bit of wine 鈥?and enjoying our time. One day the glasses disappeared. We reported to the service desk, they said they will find them. For the whole day they were saying 鈥榳e will let you know as soon as we have any news鈥? Of course, we were very upset 鈥?as this was our wedding gift. In the evening, they told us that their cleaning lady took the glasses (鈥榮he thought they were ours鈥?, put them on a cart and they disappeared. They told us they鈥檝e been looking for them for the whole day, the manager came, the Principal came,etc. They told us the cleaning lady was fired and they will compensate for the glasses. We were saying that we would rather prefer them to find the glasses, but they made it clear to us that they will compensate as they can鈥檛 find the glasses. We called to our parents (who got very upset, of course) to learn the price and reported it to the service desk. The service desk lady said the sum was too big and she had to call the Principal. She called the Principal and told us it鈥檚 alright, the Principal will compensate if we provide the checks. We already were not so confident in the hotel trustworthiness, so we requested a written confirmation, but the service lady said 鈥榊ou should trust us. We will compensate鈥? Ok, the situation was [-], probably we shouldn鈥檛 have had the glasses around, but the Principal promised to compensate, so we felt at least a bit relieved.And so, we left for Russia, and here the whole mess started. We sent the checks to the hotel the same week 鈥?by fax 鈥?and emailed them. No response. We emailed again. No response. We called them. The service desk said they received everything, but there would be public holidays, so they would get back to us the following week. We asked them why they didn鈥檛 respond before the holidays 鈥?having plenty of time, but they failed to explain. A week later 鈥?nothing, we called to the hotel and ask for the manager. They asked who was calling and said manager was not available. It lasted for a couple of days. After that we sent a rather angry message to the manager, to which he eventually responded the following day.Mr. Ramon Alegret (beware!) wrote that he consulted their legal department, and is not going to compensate. He gave out all the [-] on that we had to keep the glasses in the safe. That 鈥榳e would like also inform you that all the staff have been selected through hard programs and all of them haveour confidence from the first moment that they are considerer our staff鈥?And he even wrote 鈥榳e can not check if you have or not on the room a wedding glasses鈥? This was so appalling that we requested Mr. Ramon Alegret to provide us with the contact of the Principal 鈥?the one who actually did suggest compensation for the glasses 鈥?it was not our idea 鈥?we just wanted the glasses back. But of course, Mr. Ramon Alegret is keeping quiet. It would all have been OK if they mentioned all the [-] about legal department and the safety box when we were there. But they suggested themselves to compensate and promised to do so if we provided the checks. Does it mean that their properly-selected staff is properly-trained to lie to get rid of the customers whose property disappears in their ill-famous hotel? Probably, yes!The story is not finished, but it is clear that neither ourselves not the people we know throughout the world will ever stay in the Vincci Hotels. We urge you not to do so, either, if you want to support us 鈥?and all other people who might have suffered from this chain 鈥?against corporative thiefs and liars. Or 鈥?to put it simple 鈥?to have your property safe and your mind calm.

<Content>Excellent hotel, close to the Fira de Barcelona Conference Centres Despite what the previous reviewer said the hotel IS close to the major convention centres at the Fira de Barcelona - within easy walking distance, 10 minutes stroll maximum. Very friendly helpful staff, nothing too much trouble and everyone spoke perfect English. Lots of hot water and excellent airconditioning in the rooms although none in the hallways.The next time I am in Barcelona I will stay there again. I was the victim of a pickpocket gang on the Metro with their 'oops I've got on the wrong train manouvre' when they change their mind as they enter the train and get you in a pincer movement, but luckily only for a few euros and I didn't feel a thing!!

<Content>Modern, Classy Hotel My husband and I stayed at Vincci for 5 days on our recent trip. We were a little anxious about how this hotel would turn out to be - and were so pleasantly surprised when we arrived. The building is a new, modern construction with a classy lobby. The receptionist speaks English and was very helpful. The room itself was very tastefully decorated.The bathroom (very important) was really clean, well designed and inviting.This hotel is very close to the Ramblas - a 5 min ride by Metro. And the Metro station itself is a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Very safe to walk around at night. It was a throughly enjoyable stay, and we'd definitely go back the next time we visit!

<Content>Great time at the Vincci Arena We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Vincci Arena Barcelona. (7th - 11th October 2007). All in all we have nothing but good reports for this hotel. Its very modern, good sized rooms overall. We were located on the 6th floor directly opposite the elevator which we thought might have created lots of noise but quite the opposite...very peaceful. We had a double room which was really two single beds joined together but it was ok. The only complaint we had was the heating in the rooms. Without the air conditioning on we were nearly roasted alive as the windows wouldn't open. However with the air conditioning on it was way too cold. Wardrobe space etc was good, TV only had one English speaking channel. This wasn't a huge concern to us as we were not spending lots of time in the hotel.Breakfast is available from 7am till 10.30 am and is 15 euros per person. We didnt have breakfast in the hotel during our stay as to be honest you can get brekkie for far cheaper in any of the small cafes near to the hotel.The hotel itself is located near to Place Espagna where you can catch the Tourist Bus around Barcelona and also the underground. We had a 2 day tourist pass which was great as you can hop on and hop off the bus wherever you like on any of the 2 routes available. Only down side to this is that these buses get very busy and you have to queue at each of the attractions to get back on the bus....this can take quite a while at peak times. For us the location of the hotel was fine however I can understand that some people may find it a bit out of the way. Maybe about 15 minutes to Las Ramblas. Its sometimes nice to see other areas and there were nice little markets on at night near the hotel so it was nice to see other goings on other than in the tourist zone.Plenty little supermarket shops nearby too if you want to stock up on water, juices etc.All in all a really nice stay at this hotel, would definitely come here again.

<Content>A great stay I took my girfield here for two nights to celebrate her birthday and we had a great stay. We arrived at the hotel at 11.30am on a Sunday morning and were delighted to find that our room was already available for us - very pleasing after an early flight from London. The check in staff at the hotel were exterely helpul and always smiled a gave a passing 'hello' when passing through the reception area. For the duration of our stay the hotel did seem to be a little quiet (i.e. we never saw anyone in the hotel bar).The rooms at the hotel are funrinshed in a contemporary style and very comfortable incorporating mood lighting, a giant bed, LCD tv and a luxurious bathroom. Items from the mini-bar were also reasonably priced. Note there are no coffee or tea making facilities available.The hotel is located very close to the metro (nearest stop Tarragona - approximately 200m away) meaning that the hotel can be reached by train from the airport in less than 30 minutes. The journey is also much chepaer than taking a taxi.On our first afternoon at the hotel we used the spa facilities located in the basement - which were brand new and seemingly somewhat under used - we had the sauna and steam room to ourselves.Yes - the hotel is located a little away from the main strip of 'Las Ramblas' but for us this was a bonus. The public transport facilities are so good in Barcelona it is easy to get anywhere in just a few minutes. When we return to Barcelona we will definately stay here again. All in all a great stay.

<Content>Big beds! Great hotel, good facilities and very clean. Be careful though multimap isnt very accurate! We had to walk across the entire city before we found the Hotel. We started at 400 and something and the hotel is 50 something! The nearest tubes are Tarragona or Espanya. Good price and its not too far out of the touristy bit - just hop on the metro. though the gym is really hot - they need to improve the conditioning!

<Content>lovely stay Booked our flight and stay through last min. It was a good price and the hotel looked really nice.We got a taxi from the airport (the taxi driver had no idea where it was so we had to ask tourist info in the airport. They were v. helpful and gave us a map we could show the driver) it cost 20 Euros and was worth it.Pulled up outside the hotel and we were booked in very quickly. Went upstairs to our room. It was very clean and looked exactly like the photos. The only thing we didn't like was that the beds were 2 large singles pushed together! if you lay in the middle the beds parted and I fell down the gap once! not very romantic! lolMy boyfriend hated the fact that there was no kettle in the room as he cant function without tea in the mornings!Other than that it was all good the air con worked well and the staff were helpful.We had breakfast in the hotel 3 times at a cost of 拢10.50. It was buffet style. Continental, fresh fruit, croissants, and bacon, scrambled eggs and frankfurters, dried fruit, cereal, yoghurts. It was a great start to the day esp.. with the amount of walking we did!!!Over all a good stay. It is in a bit of a quiet are though so best to catch Metro when you go out for dinner. Metro stops at 12 o/c during the week but taxis are quite cheap costing us at most 15 Euros but it was normally less than that and we went for dinner by las ramblas, by the beach and port.BTW Best restaurant we went to was called Bestial (I had monkfish for the first time and it was stunning!!!!)

<Content>Great Hotel Excellent boutique hotel, with modern contemporary look. Located in a quite street and only 5 minutes walk from Placa De Espanya, from where you can catch the super efficient underground system and take buses absolutely everywhere ! The staff were friendly at all times and reception efficient in answering room-service calls. Hotel was clean and not packed out. Only bug bear - no UK TV, which is excused in Barcelona !We did not have breakfast as were getting up too late ! Alternative option that I Would highly recommend , I think is called the cafe NOU or NOS , located 2 minutes from the hotel;As you come out of the hotel cross over the road and turn left, then right onto the main road and walk for about for 1 minute and on your right (on the corner before the tyre fitting centre) situated on the main road is this handy cafe (yellow signage) with large windows, serving reasonably priced light breakfasts, lunches  dinners- it's friendly,modern,clean and good value. Ideal as you can load up for the day before you hit the city tourist trail ! For cheap bottled water, sweets, crisps, ice creams  practically anything else, there is a great little shop run by an Asian gentleman located about 2 premises down on the side road where Cafe NOU is located.

<Content>All good Good hotel, easy to get to being near two metro stations. Close enough to the centre (a quick metro ride) and easy to pick up one of the open-top buses which do City tours. You can walk to the Museum of Arts and also to the Olympic stadium from the hotel.The hotel itself is very comfortable, modern and quite stylish. All the mod cons, clean, quiet and the staff very friendy. Did not eat there however so cannot comment on food quality. Would defintiely stay again.

<Content>Nice Hotel The staff at the front was helpful, and friendly. Of course, my sister and I do speak spanish so I don't know what the experience would be like if we were english speakers only. The location was a bit removed from the city, but there's nothing downtown you can't get to within 15 minutes by metro (with the nearest stop about a 10 minute walk from the hotel). Also, there's a nice mall nearby, a supermarket, a cheap internet cafe run by some indian men in the neighborhood in front of the hotel. The city's beach is also about 10 minutes walking distance. It's quite awesome, and those from Barcelona are NOT shy when it comes to nudity (just look out for the nudist section if you don't like seeing 50 year old men lying around completely naked). All in all, the hotel was in a quiet but conveniently situated area. The room was spacious enough, with a comfy bed, a little table with one chair by the window, a small desk, and some pretty snazzy washrooms (covered by frosted glass. It's kind of see-through but not so much)We never used the hotel restaurant though, so I can't review that. One thing though - cleaning services take a LONG time to clean up. My sister and I would come back late in the afternoon to our rooms and the room still hadn't been cleaned up. That was definitely annoying.

<Content>Great Hotel, But No One New Where It Was We needed a hotel for one night prior to going on a cruise. We did not want to be near what we were told was noisy Las Ramblas. Hotel was quiet. It was just as it was represented on the website. The front desk clerk was very accomodating and spoke English. The MAJOR problem with the hotel, and I don't know if it is because it is a newer hotel or what but no one knew (taxi drivers) where the hotel was ! We were not the only ones who experienced this , we met others staying at the hotel that had the same problem. I do not know how they can fix this problem, but if you are going to stay at this hotel and want to venture out make sure you have the address of the hotel for the taxi drivers so they have an idea where you want to go.

<Content>Great hotel!! Date: November 24, 2006Reviewer: Freedom, Athens GreeceI was in vincci arena hotel in November,2006 and i stayed there for 5 nights with my friends. Beautiful design-hotel, quiet enough, good service. The only problem is that it is a little far from the town centre, but the underground station is only 2 blocks away. I would definately recomend it .

<Content>Wonderful stay in Early May Stayed at this great hotel for 10 nights from the 2nd May. It was the perfect location, quiet but not far away from all the action. The Metro system in Barcelona is so reliable and cheap and getting on the train at Tarragona (stopping first for a coffee opposite Joan Miro park) was an enjoyable morning ritual. The hotel is well appointed, clean, spacious and the staff helpful, but unobtrusive. Even used the downstaris gym, which was well planned out with both steam and sauna. Would definitely choose this hotel for its comfort in a well designed layout again.

<Content>Finally- truth in a picture Stayed at the Vincci for three nights early in May. Finally we were pleased that a hotel actually looks like it does on the net and that other people's views seemed accurate. The staff were really friendly, the room was lovely and the hotel is in easy reach of the underground metro and central Barcelona. My only advice is to beware of the breakfast price. Its quite expensive (30 euros for two) although you can eat as much as you like. We would definately go back and we have already recommended the Vincci to our friends.

<Content>reviews are accurate This hotel was booked for me in conjunction with major tradeshow. If you have an event at the Plaza Espana, this is great location -- short walk away. The hotel is exactly how the other reviewers described it -- small but neat rooms, hard (rock hard) beds, strange lighting, poor internet access (although they added high-speed wired in-room access halfway through the stay -- not sure if this is permanent, though), but all in all a pleasant hotel that I'd stay at again if here for a major show. The neighborhood is pretty dead at night so you've got to metro/cab to the better areas (la borne, etc) and definitely do bring an address card so the taxi knows where to take you after.

<Content>absolutley fantastic Just got back from Vincci Arena Barcelona and it was fantatsic. The hotel was clean, modern and in good location. It was slightly out of the main area but it took minutes to get were you wanted with the fabulous Metro or buses and it was so easy just to jump on and off the trains to wereever you wanted to visit in Barcelona. The hotel room was very big - we did have an Executive room and the bathroom was fantastic...I've never seen a bath so big! Staff very helpful. Had a wonderful stay and would definetley return with no hesitation. ****star plus. Close to all amentiities(you do walk alot in Barcelona though as theres so much to see and do and its such a big place!) Hotel not far from airport at all we just jumped on the bus and it dropped us off right near hotel and it was sunny in December what more can we ask for.

<Content>Hotel For All Travelers My husband and I stayed at the hotel 18-21/11. It was a pleasant hotel with a helpful staff (especially Roman). The room was a suitable size with a Art Nuevo design. Ask for rooms above the 5th floor because below this floor you have a few of the building arcoss from you. The hotel is located about five minutes from Place de Espanya where the airport bus drops you off and picks you up. The time it took us from the airport to the hotel was at most 20min. The breakfast a 14 EUR was a good deal since it was a buffet with a good amount of varieties. Don't have breakfast at the rambla as its tooo expensive and not worth it. Better off going to McDonalds at the Rambla. For a coffee with scramble egg, 2 slices of bacon and to 2 slice of toast 9 EUR. At least at the hotel you can get up as many times as you want. Its a good deal for this hotel as its a new hotel and most hotels near the center are old.Good luck planning your trip to Barcelona as its worth it.
