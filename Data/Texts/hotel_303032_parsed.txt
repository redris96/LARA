<Content>Comfortable and great value for Paris Good, comfortable option for Paris. Mme. Caroff takes great pride in her hotel and is typically there at the front desk. It's also great that the hotel's in a centrally-located neighborhood, but not quite in the heart of the tourist district. In fact, one of my favorite districts in Paris, the Rue Mouffetard, is only a 5-minute walk away -- this area has open-air markets, narrow cobble-stone streets, and many value-priced and delicious cafes/bistros. It's a throwback to the Paris prior to Baron Haussmann's redevelopments and therefore is unlike most other parts of the city. The only downside of the Carofftel is that while it's not geographically far from the city's main tourist sites (Louvre, Eiffel Tower, etc.), it can be a little complex and time-consuming to navigate the Metro lines to actually get there. So that's the trade-off -- a quaint, non-touristy neighborhood and great value-priced room, but a 30-40 minute commute to the main museums, etc.

<Content>Great value, great location, lovely hotel This is a very small hotel in a great neighborhood in Paris. It is very clean and very pleasant and welcoming. Madame Caroff is normally at the front desk all day and is very gracious; the other staff are also friendly and helpful. I stay here every time I come to Paris if there is a vacancy, it is often full 6 months ahead.

<Content>Loved the Carofftel I recently stayed at the hotel Carofftel Gobelins for 6 nights when travelling to Europe to visit my son and daughter-in-law. I found the Hotel to be very clean and comfortable and even though it is situated in a busy street, my room was very quiet and heard very little traffic noise at night. Madame Christine, who runs the Hotel is a charming lady who went out of her way to assist me, even drying my clothes for me in her dryer, and assisting me with any enquiries. For 8 Euro I had a light but substantial breakfast, including fruit, toast, yoghurt, croissants, ham, cheese, tea, coffee, juice etc.This Hotel is great value - it is safe, comfortable, affordable, and close to the Metro and I would definately stay there again. I would also recommend it to anyone travelling on their own.

<Content>Great budget hotel, convienent to metro I stayed at the Carofftel Gobelins for 3 nights in December 2006.It was conveniently located near the Gobelins Metro stop and near cafes and the RER B (at Port Royal). I found it to be a great budget hotel for single travelers. Christine was very helpful and gave me a tip to take the bus 3 stops up the street to get to Port Royal Metro (with elevators) with my luggage when I left. The hotel was clean, quiet, and somewhat small. I liked that the rooms overlooked the garden courtyard. Great for single travelers who will be out sightseeing. Cafes and small shops nearby in addition to the Rue Muffetard. I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Paris.

<Content>Great value for Paris My Mum and I stayed here at the beginning of our trip to Europe. It was certainly a great place to start. Paris is a wonderful city and we both wished we had stayed longer than 3 days.The Carofftel Gobelins is very good value in Paris. We had a lovely, clean, spacious room on a high level with views over the street. There was no traffic noise at all inside. The room contained a double and a single bed and was very roomy., clean and well presented. The bathroom was spacious with a shower over the bath. We found the manageress, Christine, very business like, but helpful and friendly. She offered to take our photos as we waited for our pick-up for the Moulin Rouge (we had made an effort to dress up). We had breakfast 3 mornings, in the hotel. It was pretty good value and we were waiting for a tour bus so did not have time to eat outside. We enjoyed the Thai restaurant directly next door, for evening meals. The food was lovely and the owners very friendly. The location was excellent...not too close to main attractions but certainly good walking distance to the tube, Seine etc. There was an internet grocery store very close by.I highly recommend this hotel. I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Great Location We have been to Paris before and stayed in the heart of where most of the tourist sites are. This time we wanted to be a bit more in a locals neighbourhood. This was a perfect location, at the bottom of Rue Mouffetard, with its relatively low priced bars, excellent restaurants and overall buzzing nightlife. The hotel itself was ideal as a base. Our room was at the back (room 41) so very quiet. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom clean. You can have breakfast for 8 euros but we ventured to the local cafes. We never used the Metro as we just enjoyed walking everywhere but the nearest line takes you straight up into the heart of Paris

<Content>A Quiet Stay We stayed here for a weekend - our first stay on the Left Bank. An excellent initiation. The hotel is typically Parisian - small rooms, tight corners and a small lift. The weekend was quite cold at nights but the hotel was comfortable. Only a few steps from the Rue Moufftard, there was an excellent choice of eating/drinking establishments around. Nearest Metro was approx 100 yards away.

<Content>Service to the door This place is a gem. Great location for those who want to be in a real neighbourhood, and the latin quarter is a great neighbourhood to be in. Having been to Paris before I wanted to stay somewhere that felt a little homely for a few days, however if you have never been to Paris and were only staying a night or two you may find it a little away from the tourist attractions but its not hard to get around Paris and the Louvre is on the same line so only one train! The hotel itself is small and friendly and the room was very clean. I stayed in a single which for the price I thought was unbelieveably good value. I had a large queen size single bed and a modern bathroom. There is no curfew and when I left at 5am the owner even walked me to the street and made sure I got in a taxi ok. Great people, great place.

<Content>Delightful two star in Paris As a habitual two star hotel patron, I don't usually expect much, other than that a hotel be clean, reasonably priced and in a decent neighborhood. The Carofftel Gobelins proved to be much more than that.I had read some good things about this hotel on this website, and booked it for a couple of nights when alone in Paris. I found it to be every bit as nice as described, and then some. The proprietor was pleasant, tactful and always available to assist with questions or concerns. The place was spotless, and my little single room larger and airier than expected. (Granted, it was still very small compared to most American hotel rooms, but more than large enough for me and my three suitcases!) To add to this, the hotel is situated in an interesting area of Paris, within very easy walking distance of the fascinating Rue Mouffetard, the Pantheon and Jardin de Luxembourg. Many pleasant restaurants and brasseries, as well as ATMs, are within easy walking distance, and the Gobelins metro stop is just steps away.This would be a great hotel for anyone who's a little uneasy about traveling to a foreign city, but who likes the feel of a small, independent hotel for a home base. I will definitely go back.

<Content>Pleasant Stay in Paris We researched a hotel in Paris extensively. After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and contacting the hotel about the price we decided to stay at Hotel Carofftel Gobelins (98 Euros/night for a room for 3). We were pleasantly surprised. We tried to transfer from the airport (CDG) to city center on Metro. After surfacing at St. Michel we took a cab to the hotel and cut our travel costs significantly. We stayed in a room for 3 and had ample room in the bedroom itself. It was very clean, and I am super picky about cleanliness! The bathroom was small, even by European standards, and was only separated from the room by a little sliding door, like a closet door. One had just enough room to turn around in the shower stall but it was clean enough. The breakfast is a little pricey so we decided to take our chances at the local market. About 100 yards from the entrance there is a closed off road with an open market and we found the most delightful food there every morning. It had fresh fruit, pastry shops, cheese shops and little cafes. We bought our food each morning and ate in a little church courtyard and watched the market. It was one of the highlights of our trip! Overall, we were very pleased with our stay there, with not only the price, but the location and friendliness of the staff.

<Content>Excellent Budget Choice Hotel My wife and I just finished our first trip to Paris, and Carofftel Gobelins was the hotel we stayed in. We struggled to make a choice of where to stay in Paris, ultimately deciding that we wanted to be in the Latin Quarter, and found this hotel through Trip Advisor. The reviews on it were consistently good, so we decided to book. Price was a factor, as we had decided we only really needed a place to sleep at night...but we got much more. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room we got, and the bathroom was big by European standards, with a tub/shower combination. The room was located right on Avenue des Gobelins, which is a busy/noisy street, but when you closed the windows, we were amazed at how little noise got in. Breakfast was more than enough to get going with in the morning, and the hotel is located within a minute's walk of a Metro station, which greatly aids in getting around the city, and within a quick cab ride of Gare Lyon, which helped us, as we were taking the train when we left the city.The staff were pleasant and courteous and always willing to help. The room and the hotel were in great shape, very neat and tidy, and there is an excellent restaurant (Marty's) located right next door. Overall we were very pleased with this hotel (we have travelled in Europe extensively, so we have a lot of experience with what a typical European hotel room will look like), and would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Paris. We only had 2 days this time, but the great location of the hotel aided us in seeing as much as we did.

<Content>Another great stay! We stayed at the Carofftel Gobelins in 2006 for nine days and enjoyed it very much. This stay was only for three days, but we found that everything was still the same. The owner/manager, Christine Caroff, is friendly and helpful. The rooms, while not large, are adequate and very clean; the location is good, with Metro and bus links close by; and it is only a short walk in any direction to find good restaurants. The hotel's breakfast is very good, buffet style, and the price is less than what you would pay outside the hotel. We have walked, at a 'tourist' pace from the hotel to the Eiffel Tower (that covers most of the sights on the Left Bank) in about an hour and a half. This hotel has everything that the traveller is looking for: clean rooms, good food, reasonable price, great location, and friendly staff. We hope to return to the Carofftel Gobelins again.

<Content>Clean and Friendly I booked the room via Venere.com but just to find out that it could be cheaper if I booked via the hotel's website. They posted the room rate at the lobby and when we asked why was ours more expensive (just 5-10 euro difference) the manager gave us some lengthy explanation that we still don't understand today. Overall the stay was very pleasant. We are located very near the metro station, bars/restaurants and so forth. The room was kept clean everyday and the maids were fantastic. We would love to stay here again if we are in Paris.

<Content>Great value for the money My husband and I just returned from a 2-week European vacation, and Paris was our last stop. We booked this hotel based on TripAdvisor feedback, and the reviews are accurate! The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, the front desk staff were helpful and polite, and we really felt like we got good value for our 90 Euros per night. Keep in mind that this is a two star hotel -- it's not the Ritz -- but we were only in the room to sleep, shower and change clothes, so it worked well for us. The location was great as well -- less than a block from a Metro station (line 7). I would definitely stay at this property again!

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel My husband and I just got back from a 5 day stay in Paris at Hotel Carofftel Gobelins on April 16th. I have to say that after a night flight from Montreal, which neither of us slept on, we were very glad to arrive via RER train from CDG airport and metro to the hotel at 10:30 and able to check in immediately. No problems at all. Christine (the owner) is very nice. She and all her staff speak English quite well, but she's more expressive when speaking French, so we stuck to French. After a little nap to recoup from the flight, we set out to investigate the area and maybe hit a least one of the many attractions on our list. While walking to the Pantheon (a must see), we went down Rue des Mufetards and loved the atmosphere. There were so many little food shops for fresh breads, croissants, cheeses and wines at reasonable prices. There are many restaurants there as well, so after a long say of sight seeing, we basically always headed back there and picked a restaurant to eat at. One thing that is a must are the fresh crepes that the store venders make (either salty or sweet) amazing.Back to the hotel:The rooms are small compared to what you get in Canada, the States or the Carribean, but very suitable with high ceiling, which makes it feel much bigger. We had a comfy double bed (although the feather pillows are horrible since they flatten out pretty quickly), there was a big enough closet and a desk with a big window that we could open and step out onto a small balcony looking out on Rue des Gobelins. The bathroom is big enough, although they should have either had a bigger sink or moved the shelf that's above the sink somewhere else as when washing your face you tend to spill some water on the floor (no biggy, just put down one of the towels). The bathroom has a patio window as well. I've read a lot of issues with the size of the shower, but it was fine. You had enough space to wash up properly and turn around as much as you want, but I can see how if someone is really overweight, they might have a little bit of a problem. No hot water issues. We did not take the breakfast option with the hotel as there are so many little places to get great fresh food at every morning and at reasonable prices too.TV is a 13 inch and only has 1 English Channel the BBC World. It has an MTV like channel (I think it was German).The closest metro is Les Gobelins which can get you pretty much anywhere in Paris due to the metro system being to easy to navigate. We walked most of the time, but did buy a packet of 10 metro tickets for 11.10Euros. The weather in Paris can be finicky, so pack some sweaters a jacket and a couple of umbrellas 4-sure. We needed them all, plus gloves and a scarf. Its chilly when the sun's not out.All in all, if you choose this hotel, you will not be disappointed. The location is great as you get a real feel for Paris (not too many tourists around).I can't wait to go back.

<Content>Clean, comfotable, quiet My daughter and I just returned from our first trip to Paris. The Carofftel was clean, comfortable, and quiet--just what we were counting on. I echo all the positive comments from other reviewers. We had a double room overlooking the street. We could see the dome of the Pantheon from the balcony. All of the staff were friendly, and Christine was wonderful. Our reservations were handled smoothly through email.We took the train in from CDG airport, transferring to the metro at Les Halles. We had a bit of trouble finding the hotel at first because the Paris street signage was new to us. In case anyone else plans on arriving from the Gobelins metro: we took the Les Manufactures de Gobelins exit from the metro. Coming out of the metro station, walk one block straight ahead. The hotel will be on the left side of the street.Our time went too fast! I would have loved to try the food at the Moufftard market but we were not there at meal time. The boulangerie mentioned in an earlier review was great. Treat yourself to a fruit tart! There is also another boulangerie in the opposite direction of the metro--can't remember its name. And nearby is a little restaurant where I'd order a coffee to go to enjoy with my chocolate pastry outside the bakery. Tres bon!

<Content>Nice place in good location This was our fourth stay at Hotel Carofftel. This hotel is simple, clean and in a great location. The area (near rue Mouffetard) is perfect, as there are lots of places to eat and shop--but it is not overrun with tourists. The hotel does serve breakfast for 7.50 euros, but we like to try out the little cafes for a French breakfast. There is a great one, on the big avenue just around the courner next to the sushi place (which is also good).

<Content>Decent Hotel My wife and I stayed at Carofftel Goeblins in March of this year for 3 nights. The location was great and the lady at the desk was very helpful. It is just up the street from a metro stop and bus lines go right in front of the hotel. Rue Moufftard is about a block away and has many great shopping opportunties for cheese, pastries and wine. My only complaint was the shower which was so small that your stomach would turn the water off if you tried to move while taking a shower. It definitely would not work for an overweight person. Other than that the room was basic but clean. Would stay again but would ask to see the bathroom first.

<Content>Basic, Clean, Comfortable and best of all--Cheap! This hotel is in the Jardin Des Plants quarter of Paris, and is very close to a Metro stop. This hotel is a good bargain. It is a short walk to a nice market and cheap eats on Rue Mouffetard, and a moderate walk to the Latin Quarter. The room was very basic, with a double bed, simple desk, space to hang clothes and a few useful shelves. Don't expect all the frou-frou you get in a mid-level American hotel these days (plush down comforters, both hard and soft pillows, etc). Nonetheless, the bed was perfectly comfortable. The staff was pleasant and helpful, and most of them spoke good English. There are several nice bistros in the neighborhood for breakfast, where you can sit and people-watch. You can save a lot of money by using the public transportation directions on their website to get to the hotel from the airports.

<Content>Very nice 10-day stay at Carofftel Gobelins I stayed for 10 days in January at Hotel Carofftel Gobelins.Traveling for business as a single woman, I found this place very much to my liking, and quite reasonably priced. (I paid 79E for a single with a double bed.) It is owner-run, with a small, consistent staff, who were friendly and helpful. Having read in another post that the rooms that face the courtyard have larger bathrooms, I requested one of those when I made reservations. As a result, I had a nice bath with tub  shower. The room itself was simple, but adequate. Most important--the bed was comfortable, the room was warm, and it was extremely clean.They have Wifi throughout the hotel, although it was somewhat spotty in my room. However, I could always get a connection in the dining area, so I would sometimes go downstairs to use my laptop. They had a daily charge for WiFi -- around 2E per day, although it was cheaper for longer stays. Much better than a number of hotels I checked with while selecting a place, who often wanted 10E for an hour of connectivity! Although the Hotel is right on Avenue des Gobelins, which is quite a large street, my room was very quiet. I was surprised every morning to emerge from the Hotel onto the street.Breakfast was adequate  not bad for 7.5E--coffee or tea, plus a buffet of juice, pastries, bread, yogurt, ham  cheese. Since I had to be at meetings most mornings, it was simplest for me to eat at the Hotel before heading out. It's very easy to get around from this Hotel. Metro a block away; several bus routes go right by. About a 15 to 20 minute walk to the Seine, 7 to 10 minute walk to the Place d'Italie.I would happily stay there again.

<Content>Good cheap hotel Stayed here from 9th to the 12th of January and was pleasantly happy with our stayGood points: - Near metro station to get to everywhere else as although this is not a bad location it would probably take about an hour to walk to the likes of the eiffel tower. The room size was really good considering it was Paris. The rooms were very clean with towels changed daily and a nice warm heater on.The quietness of the room was amazing considering we where only on the second floor overlooking the road. I don't think it would be good in the summer with the balcony doors open though as the road is mega busy.The location for shops, restaurants and cafes is great.The price is the best thing of all. We paid about 拢65 a night which is fantastic in paris!Very nice staff who spoke great english and lent us an iron, let us leave our cases on checkout day and even found a mobile in our room and packed it in our waiting cases.Bad points:- The hotel is dated and not in a good way! The hotel breakfast was supposed to be included when we booked, but an e-mail later on informed us that was a mistake, so check if you book direct with the hotel that its not still saying that brekkie is included. We then ate outside the hotel.Lack of facilities - no bar or anything, but don't really need it with everything that is on doorstep.The shower was tiny in the bathroom, but very clean.All in all I would recommend it to fellow first time travellers to paris for value for money, it cannot be beaten!

<Content>Arrogance of owner I have just returned from spending 5 nights with my family at the Carofftel Gobelins Hotel.As with all previous reviews the Rue Mouffetard just down the street from the hotel is absolutely wondeful. We however certainly do not agree with the friendliness of Christine (owner?)We found her to be extremely arrogant!!On one occasion upon requesting an additional towel for my 17 year old daughter to dry her (very long )hair, Christine rushed into the lift with my husband, barged into my daughters room  wanted to know why one person needs so many towels ! The towels by the way were threadbare.We were also reprimanded by her,for bringing food into the hotel room.Just another incident: we were stuck in the hotel lift on one occasion. All in all, I would not recommend this establishment.

<Content>great hotel at a great price. what a little gem!! the Carofftel is in a great location close to the metro (gobbelns station) which goes directly to the Louvre and once you get the hang of the metro lines its almost childs play to get to the Arc, the Eiffel, Place de la Concorde and other fabulous Paris sights and shopping districts. The Rue Mouffetard markets just minutes walk away is to die for and great value in terms of fresh cheeses fruits, pastries and the best roast chook and potatoes I have ever had. Also located close by is a reat bistro with fabulous takeaway pizzas perfect for a cheaper night in..The hotel staf are friendly and very helpful, full of great advice for shopping and sightseeing. Husband and I travelled backpack style and arrived early to the hotel loaded down with our packs, the room was not ready but we were offered coffee and told that they would look after our packs if we wanted to head out for breakfast.have to agree with the small shower, hubby is 6ft 7 and had a spot of trouble trying to turn in the stall, but otherwise it was fine.overall a fantastic value for money hotel in a easily accessible part of Paris, if you are looking for luxury this isnt it, we booked through venere.com and at 80 euros a night per room it cant be beaten!!!

<Content>Very good hotel/good value for the money My spouse and I stayed there for six days with our 11-year-old daughter in a triple; the room doesn't radiate quirky charm, but it is quite pleasant, quite a decent size, with a good-sized bathroom (with tub). * Spotlessly clean, staff is helpful as needed. Christine, the owner, works very, very hard, and it shows. * Location was, to my mind, PERFECT: on the edges of the Latin Quarter (touristy but fun Rue Mouffetard just up the street, 10-15 minutes up the hill to the Pantheon, 20-minute walk to St. Germain/St. Michel, 5 more minutes to Notre Dame) but not smack in the heat of the chaos. Might be a little noisy on street side during the summer, when windows are open. * Nice cafe down the street (A Verse Toujours), excellent bakery (Boulangerie de Monge) nearby.

<Content>Great hotel and location! Having been to Paris many times I know the city quite well. This is my 2nd stay at this hotel. I can't say enough good things about it. The staff is helpfull but not overly friendly. The owner Christine is well informed and gives good advice when asked. Good sized clean rooms with good size bath. That said the rooms in the front of the hotel overlooking the street have smaller bathrooms with showers while the rooms in the back have large bathrooms with proper tub and shower. I've stayed in both rooms now and personally I prefer the room in the front as it is brighter with small balcony, while the room in the back overlooks an inner courtyard is darker. Both rooms are quiet though. My stay both times has been 7 nights each time. The breakfast is basic continental with good ham, cheese, breads, juice and good coffee for 7.50Euro which you can have as much as you want. I could go down to the market and have coffee and pastry which we did one day but found we paid more for the coffee and pastry and were still hungry! Yes, it's more authentic to eat outside but ample opportunity for that during the day and evening.The market every morning is great for looking and shopping and if you walk up the hill you will find yourself at the Pantheon. Walk the other direction outside the hotel and you find yourself at Place d'Italie with more great restaurants and another short walk you will find great vietnamese and chinese restaurants as you are close to chinatown. Directly outside the hotel is a place to rent bikes and if coming from the airport you can take the train. Taxi cost us 55 euro arriving on a Friday evening during rush hour and during the train strike!Hotel books out very quickly as they have good local trade from business people coming in from the provinces. I have already booked my next holiday for the spring!

<Content>Good location and price I stayed for three nights and the hotel was a good value for the price. The double room I had was much larger than I had expected and had plenty of space. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. While the bed was a bit on the hard side, the room was clean and the bathroom was large as well. Overall a good experience and would stay again.

<Content>perfect in all ways This was my forth trip to Paris and my first with my grown-up Son. I am a confirmed 2 star traveller when it comes to hotel choices. My preference is to stay in neighborhoods where I can experience the day-to-day life with locals more than tourists. I chose this hotel based primarily on Trip Advisor reviews, photos at the web site and its location and I was not disappointed. The hotel itself is on a Boulevard which means a wide street with lots of trees and benches to sit on. It was busy with traffic, of course, but not overwhelmingly so and nighttime was quiet. There are lot of restaurants both in the neighborhood and within walking distance. The Metro stop is 500 feet away and Place d'Italie is right down the street and is a major Metro interchange. The immediate neighborhood is safe and peaceful at night. We walked home at 11:30 from a late night at a cafe and there were couples walking down the street with babies in strollers - very safe! There are lots of different kinds of food shops, and drugstores, and a Monoprix (CVS with clothes) across the street - very convenient, bookstores, newspaper shops, etc., etc. Just down the street are the Rue Monge and Rue Moufftard which are market streets - quite colorful. We watched some local musicians and dancers perform on the way to the Arab Institute - worthy of a visit. Because the hotel is on the edge of the 5th Arr. you can walk to all of the Latin Quarter, along the Seine and even to the Jardins Luxembourg - very pleasant way to spend an afternoon. There are nice walks in other directions as well although we did not have the time to enjoy them.The hotel experience was excellant. The room we had was on the street and reasonably quiet at night even with the double-glazed windows open. We were on the 3rd floor ( there is an elevator) with a nice overview of the street scene. The room was large by european standards, the beds were comfortable and well tended, the bath was clean with newer fixtures, continuous hot water and a real tub - if your so inclined. We enjoy the convenience of breakfast at the hotel and were not disappointed in the quality. Management was friendly and helpful especially with some issues with the WiFi that my son had. And finally the price was reasonable especially given the exchange rate. I will stay at this hotel next time in Paris and I seriously doubt that one could find a better 2 star hotel in the city.

<Content>Excellent Stay!! Just returned from 4 days in Paris. The hotel was exactly what were looking for, clean, inexpensive, courteous staff, and perfect location. The rue mouffetard market right around the corner is a must! My wife and I grabbed some cheese, bread, wine, and baked goodies each morning while walking on our way to the Ile de Cite (10 minutes away), and noshed as we ambled along. Many thanks to others reviews regarding Au Petit Bistro. Great food and authentic ambience. Will definetly stay at the Carofftel for our next visit.

<Content>Very nice and clean My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights. We were looking for a clean, nice, not-too-far from the center hotel, and we didn't want to pay for a 3star. That's what we got. The room was clean  bright, the bathroom was small but not tiny. We had a nice view on Avenue de Gobelins. The staff were very very kind and helpful. The metro station is less than 5 mins away, and you can walk to the Latin Quarter (and NotreDame) in about 20 mins. The area is really nice by the way, elegant buildings, lots of cafes, and the nearby Rue Mouffetard market and food shops.We were really happy with this hotel especially considering we payed 72 euros per night by booking through their website.

<Content>An adequate hotel My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in June 2006 while we crammed in a visit to Paris on our way home from Greece. We booked through Expedia and paid 80 Euro per night.The hotel is an older style one with a bit of character that you don't get in a hotel chain. You don't get a credit card-style room key, but rather a real key that locks the deadbolt to your room. The front desk required us to leave the room key while we went out and about for the day which I thought was a little odd, but apparently they just didn't want us to accidentally lose it. What if someone else had come in after a shift change and said they were us?! I don't remember having to show our passports to get our room key when we returned.There is a tiny dining room (and I mean tiny) just beside the front desk, but we never used it. Being close to the Mouffetard market and an incredible bakery (a couple doors down from the Starbuck's), we had too many eating options than to want to eat right at the hotel.We had a room on the fourth floor that did not face the street (Rue Gobelins) so we did not have any issues with noise. The elevator is small and very slow moving, but this is an older and small hotel after all. It eventually gets you to your floor.The room itself was very small, but we were basically only there to sleep so it didn't matter. The double bed (which is the size we sleep on at home) was fine - not great but not bad either. The bathroom had a smallish tub with a shower and it was adequate. The entire hotel was clean which was our only real concern. There is no air conditioning but they did provide us with a fan. Fortunately it wasn't unbearably hot when we were there. The tv in the room was a 12 colour tv with a remote, which was okay. Again we were hardly ever at the hotel so I didn't mind it.All in all we got what we wanted at Hotel Carofftel - a clean place to sleep for a small amount of money.

<Content>Bargain Hotel but read the complete review for better picture We stayed in this hotel for 4 days in September 2006. Here is my review of the hotelThings I liked1. In the heart of Latin quarter.Very near Pantheons.2. Very Near to Subway stop ( Les Gobelins is 2 mins from hotel) or place de Itale is 15 mins walk. Opposite to bus stop. Bus 27 takes you directly to louvre.3. Good eating place nearby.4. Very courteous staff and helpful. They speak english.5. Room were tidy and bathroom was cleanThings I did not like1. Little far from CDG.2. Breakfast is around 8 euros but thats the norm in paris.Well here is my $0.02. Get used to small rooms, small bathroom. Also on first day we were not able to sleep as we had to keep the windows open and there was lot of noise but from day two with day outing we crashed as soon as we got into bed.Overall : I dont mind staying here again.

<Content>Good hotel for a bargain price We stayed in this hotel for four nights in September and it was very pleasant. There is quite a bit of street noise but we got a fan and closed the doors and it wasn't too bad even though the weather was really hot in Paris during our stay. It was very clean and it was great to have a bathroom en suite. The shower was very small and required a slow and delicate shower but no worries otherwise. It's convenient to the subway, near the Mouffetard market and tons of restaurants. We'd stay there again.

<Content>Good Hotel We stayed at the Carofftel Gobelins from 4 - 8 August 2006.We paid 83 Euro/night for a large room (which could accomodate up to 4 people, there were only 2 of us) with private bathroom and TV.Being our first trip to Paris we found this hotel conveniently located in Les Gobelins, very close to the Metro station of the same name. There were restaurants, supermarkets, post office, and a self service laundry all within walking distance.The owner was very helpful and pleasant.Would stay here again.

<Content>Good value Our family of 4 stayed at this hotel on our last trip leg in Paris in early July. We'd stayed in the St. Germain area two weeks earlier on arrival in Paris, which is more conveniently located within walking distance to many of the major attractions (Louvre, Notre Dame etc). We stayed in Room 22 which faces the street with floor to ceiling French doors with a small geranium festooned balcony. Room was plain yet clean, spacious enough, with significant street noise at night. We wore ear plugs and closed the french doors, using the portable room fan. The staff was helpful and accommodating.....good value. We opted for the breakfast because it was convenient but you might do better for the price in a nearby cafe or boulangerie. We need our coffee.....Different crowd here in this district.....lots of university students, more diverse and with a relaxed atmosphere. We enjoyed the nearby Rue Mouffetard with its cafes and market stalls filled with quality fruits and vegetables, wines, fish, etc. Metro station Les Gobelins is a block away and easy to use.Not a bad place to be when departing Paris by plane (CDG). The RER station (Pont Royal) that serves the airport (both terminals) is a 15 minute walk away and is easy to negotiate as compared to the larger stations that serve multiple train lines. There's even a street elevator that serves the station.....

<Content>Ok Hotel, but very small uncomfortable beds My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in April. We were looking for an inexpensive hotel in the 5th district. I studied in Paris some years ago and I just love this particular area of the city so I was quite keen on finding a hotel in this area for our visit. It is a great location. The hotel was clean. Very good price for the room. Really inexpensive. The room itself was a decent size. However, the furniture, including the double bed seemed like it was miniature size if that makes any sense. My husband is about 179 cm (6'0) and I am about 175 cm (5'9) and it seemed as though our feet were hanging off the end of the bed. The bed in and of itself seemed like it was only about 140cm wide which seems very small for a double bed at a hotel. At first I thought that they had given us a single room by mistake due to the size of the bed and not the size of the room. Besides being small, the bed was extremely uncomfortable and I found it really hard to get any good sleep (which ended up making me cranky.) :-(The owner of the hotel was not as pleasant as everyone on this site claims that she is. We asked her to help us check on when a particular bus we needed to catch to the airport would be leaving and she just seemed annoyed. As far as the breakfast was concerned, I would recommend skipping it and going to one of the many cafes in the area. It just wasnt worth the price for what you got. There were croissants, lots of white bread, jam, yogurt, cereal, juice, coffee, water. I would have just preferred to have to a cafe and had a warm breakfast. I am not into eating croissants for breakfast. That isn't breakfast to me, but to others this type of breakfast may be fine and totally what you are looking for. It is all a matter of what you like. I just want to point out about the possibility of being able to go to a nearby cafe (of which there are many) for breakfast if you like warmer food or something else other than what is listed above. It is optional at the hotels in paris whether you take breakfast there or not meaning that you usually pay extra for it. So you can opt out and spend your money at a cafe instead.I wouldn't stay at this hotel again because of the bed. It was just really uncomfortable. We stayed in a room on the 1st floor (that is the 2nd floor -if you are an American reading this) and maybe it was just a bad bed and maybe other beds in the hotel are comfortable. I would have paid more to stay somewhere else and have been able to get a proper nite's rest.Otherwise, if you are a couple of inches shorter than we are and don't mind an uncomfortable bed, it is a great location and great price!

<Content>Great Value Two-Star Hotel My wife and I stayed 6 nights at this hotel in May, 2006. We had read the great reviews and we expected a lot. We were not disappointed. The location is excellent, about a half block from the Les Gobelins Metro. Everything in the hotel is mini-sized: the entry foyer, the elevator, the bathrooms, and especially, the shower which was 24x30 and was difficult to turn around in. In fact, the hotel's facing to the street is only a double door wide, sandwiched between 2 restaurants (one of which is very good, reasonably-priced Chinese). The hotel does not offer Internet access, which makes it difficult to send e-mail; Internet cafes are a thing of the past, at least in Paris. There is cable TV, but except for an occasional sports event, there is no English language channel. Trumping these negatives are 2 major pluses: the hotel is impeccably clean and would put many US motels to shame. And perhaps most importantly, the rates are extremely reasonable. In fact, a one-star hotel around the corner charged as much as the Carofftel. Incidentally, the hotel has a very user-friendly web site and reservations can easily be made over the Internet. As other reviewers have said, do ask for a room facing the street. The view out the window is pure Paris residential! The staff, especially the often-mentioned Christine, speaks good English and is quite accommodating. We did not partake of the 7.50 euro breakfast offered by the hotel. There is a very good mini-mart next to the McDonalds around the corner. In the other direction (north), the Rue Mouffetard market is real local collection of shops and food stands. On balance, we're giving the hotel 4 out of 5 stars. The lack of Internet was an issue for us; it might not be for someone else. That factor aside, we thought the hotel was great and would recommend it as an excellent value in a very good central Paris location

<Content>Pros and Cons I came here with my husband for a few days in May. I liked it and found it to be a very good value. I searched extensively on tripadvisor and many other websites and could not find many hotels in this price range with good reviews.As the type of traveller who likes to go around all day -- morning to night -- exploring, and wandering, and walking around the city ... I thought this was a very nice place to lay my head at night. We stayed in the twin bedded room with bath -- (one full or queen size bed with a twin bed). The room was pretty large. Ample room for both of our large suitcases, and we used the twin bed as storage. The room (and hotel) was very clean and well-kept. Bed was comfy. Bathroom was large enough, and the tub was deep and good for soaking at the end of a long day. For me, the bath was worth the extra 10 euros. Location was okay, but not perfect. Down the street, (if you're facing the hotel -- a block to the right, past the fountain), there's the Mouffetard Market in the mornings where there are many cute cafes, fruit stands, and interesting shops. It'd be a shame to miss this if you stay at this hotel. Hotel is near to transportation -- very very convenient bus lines across the street and a metro stop also. (The metro is NOT one of the main lines, so you have to learn how to transfer.) Most people wouldn't consider it walking distance to any of the major places of interest, but if you learn how to use the bus / train systems, it's not too much of a problem. We really enjoyed walking around Rue Monge, and just looking around the neighborhood surrounding the hotel. Very good bakeries and decent restaurants nearby too. (La Forge seemed to be pretty popular for the locals.) Starbucks was nearby, which was good for accessing a good ole cup of American coffee, instead of espresso or cappuccino. Coffee with a chocolate croissant (from the bakery across the street) were a perfect breakfast. Hotel has an elevator which could fit me and my husband with both of our big bags. The negatives -- not too many. No international TV. Didn't seem like a big deal until we got tired of trying to speak French and just wanted some English programming for the end of the day. Not near to the big sites, requiring much use of public transportation. My husband had knee problems, and so it was hard for him to go up and down the metro stairs multiple times a day. If possible, try to avoid the large metro stations (e.g., Chatelet), because these require longer transfer walks. The rooms were not fancy by any means -- and so if nice furniture / decoration is important, then this isn't the place fo you. Interestingly, you had to leave the keys at the front of the hotel every time you left your room and the keys would just hang on the wall. Mostly, the keys were watched over, but a few times, I went to the desk and nobody was keeping them secure. We did not have any problems with security, luckily, and I haven't seen any complaints on the internet either. I think many other hotels in Paris are like this.All in all, I do recommend this hotel. Mostly for the value and cleanliness. It was comfortable and probably had larger rooms than other similarly priced hotels. The hostess Christine was polite and answered our questions in terms of how to get where, but did not seem to extend past this. (I was a bit disappointed in this aspect, but many other reviewes seemed to have good experiences with her.)If you're a first-timer and staying in Paris for only a few days, I would probably recommend choosing the hotel based on location. If you're willing to fight it out a bit with transportation and want to save some money, then I think this hotel is very good.

<Content>Clean, quiet, convenient We also had a wonderful experience at the Carofftel. Our triple room was a very good size, bigger than we expected, cheerful, and meticulously cleaned daily. Comfortable beds, too. The bathroom was fairly large and modern. The location was perfect--we could easily hop on the bus or metro, and walking was a pleasure. The Rue Mouffetard Market made us feel as if we were in a small town, and we loved going there for a pastry or just to wander around. We loved Au Petit Bistro (89 rue Mouffetard) for dinner, going 4 times in our week there! Also highly recommend the Creperie Moulin on the Rue Fer a Moulin nearby. They are the genuine thing--don't bother ordering crepes in the cafes, where they're thick and soggy. We found that breakfast in the Carofftel was a huge bargain, despite the high seeming price. You get much more for your Euros--yoghurt, ham, cheese, fruit, juice,in addition to plenty of tea, coffee, or hot chocolate and baguettes or croissants. Staff all very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great place to stay in Paris My friend stayed in this hotel seven years ago and had recommended it to me, and I was not disappointed during my stay there this spring. I found the place very clean, friendly, and in great location. Christine was very helpfull and very patient with all the questions we had as the first time travelers to Paris with absolutly no knowledge of French. If you're looking for a good place for a decent price, this hotel would be an excellent choice! Ask for the off street room.

This hotel is obvisiously well taken care of and the innkeeper, Christine, was very nice and helpful. It was also very affordable and we were on a tight budget. This is my fav hotel in Paris. What a great place to end up after a long plane flight.

<Content>Good deal! We stayed here in late March while the elevator was being repaired and got 10 percent off. I paid $261 for four nights for a single; my friends paid about $10 more a night for a double. I thought it was a great deal.I was very satisfied with the cleanliness. We had new towels and the bed was made every day. The rooms were small but not unusually so by European standards.My friends thought their bed was soft and lumpy, but mine was OK. Our only other complaint was that we could hear other guests clomping up the stairs late at night (as we had done earlier!)We were very happy with the location. Perhaps because of the time of year, we felt that we were mostly among locals. It was very near to the Rue Mouffetard markets, and we enjoyed walking there, and stopping to get bread, cheese and wine every day after our travels, enjoying it as an appetizer in the room.There is a bakery about a block away, Boulangerie Monge, that is out of this world for breakfast or lunch. We enjoyed dinner at a Brazilian restaurant, which I think was off Rue Monge, and a traditional French place on Port Royal, Le Languedoc. Both excellent and well priced.The hotel breakfast was very nice at 7E, though admittedly I am putty in the hands of cafe au lait and chocolate brioche.I would be delighted to return here.

<Content>Tres Parisien A delightful hotel with charm and ambience, certainly not a big box chain.Staff were charming and helpful, breakfast delicious and the location superb - Gobbelins metro is about 200 metres up the rue. Located in a lovely part of the city with markets, boulangeries and cafes all within a short walk.We were visiting in snowy slushy december, and the room was toasty warm and snug, with a great outlook over the street. The rooms and the fully fitted bathroom are typical traditional european (i.e. smaller than modern hotels) but beautifully redecorated.Christine, who runs the hotel, is a gem. Forget most of the stereotypes of les parisiens, they are for the most part, charming, graceful and very pleasant. The city just reeks of style and atmosphere.We would certainly return to this hotel.

We had two double rooms, one on the street-side and one facing the court-yard, which had a bathtube and was more quiet. The Hotel was just perfect for what we wanted: tiny, but very clean.The beds were also very comfortable(good matrasses)with separate pillows. You can walk to Gare de Lyon (20 min.)or take bus 91 or take a taxi (we paid 9 euro).I can recommend the Hotel to everyone.

<Content>Delightful hotel in excellent area I stayed in this lovely hotel in May after reading glowing recommendations on this site. Believe me, they're all true - this place is a gem. My room was spotlessly clean, the front desk staff were helpful , very important indeed for a solo woman traveller, I felt perfectly safe in the area day  night. I had a room overlooking the very busy avenue but it was not excessively noisy  I felt like a real Parisienne as I flung open my windows every morning. I must say I did splash out on a double room after reading that the singles were very small but felt the extra was well worth paying. I have stayed in several other hotels in Paris, some more expensive, but none as nice as this - I thoroughly recommend it.

<Content>cheap place / good location I was in a single room which had a nice clean bathroom and very comfortable king single bed. The room was also very quiet.The location is great with plenty of bakeries, etc around. You are better off going out each morning rather than paying the 7 Euros for breakfast (bit expensive for what you get). Metro station is convienient being just up the street.I would recommend this hotel and would defintely stay here again.
