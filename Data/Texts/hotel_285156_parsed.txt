<Content>Loved the food at Trebbio Close to the train station. Quiet, close to lots of restaurants and attractions. Would recommend it. Only negative was the air conditioning which did not provide enough cool air in August. Great restaurant not far called Trattoria Trebbio where we had one of our best Italian meals.

<Content>A gem of a hotel This is a perfect budget hotel, right in the centre of florence between the train station adn the duomo. The staff were extremely helpful and the room was quite big with a nice ensuite too. I recommend this hotel for a weekend stay in florence - it is definately worth a look!

<Content>Nizza is Nice (Enough) Hotel Nizza is an accommodation typical of European hotels. It was fairly easy to find and was a quick walk from the train station (once we actually went the correct way!). My husband and I would have no problem staying at this hotel again as it was clean and near to the attractions.Pros: The room is of decent size. The room had a private bathroom with a stand up shower and the size of bathroom was more than adequate. For the adventuresome and inquisitive American, there is a bidet, but I digress. The Hotel was close to Santa Maria Novella, markets, and the duomo. It was near enough to the Ponte Vecchio, as well. A basic breakfast is included. Some of the food stuffs that were served include: hard breakfast rolls, cereal, a very limited selection of meats and cheese, toast, and croissants. Juice was served, but don't expect fresh squeezed; you will be served the Italian equivalent of Tang. There is a coffee machine that makes espresso, American Coffee, hot chocolate and gives hot water for tea. All of the hotel clerks were kind to my husband and me and were willing to give suggestions if we asked. Cons: Don't expect any frills, i.e., mini fridge, soap, shampoo, shower cap, etc. Also, do not expect an elevator. If you can't walk up the steep steps, then forget about staying here. If you have a poor tolerance for heat, then don't stay at this hotel during the summer months. Although it is true that there is air conditioning in the room, the wall unit is just not powerful enough to cool down the room sufficiently. The common rooms are not air conditioned. So, breakfast is a bit stuffy as the ceiling fan merely pushes around hot air. Lastly, if you book a room with a double bed, it is not a true double; it is two twin beds pushed together. The problem with this setup is that I always roll into the uncomfortable center crack. Also, the pillows were so thin I got better support using the neck support pillow I use when flying.

<Content>Excellent value We had an excellent stay at the Hotel Nizza in Florence. The hotel couldn't be more central: it's within a stroll of the railway station and Duomo, and within 10 minutes of all the other major sites. There are also numerous snack bars and restaurants on the doorstep.There is a flight of stone steps up to the reception area (no lift, but this was not a problem). There is a lobby area adjacent to reception which has a PC with internet access, seating and a small library. We had room 22 which is on the same floor as the reception area and facing a side street. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Neither of us speak Italian but we had no communication problems. One of the owners in particular had good English and enjoyed telling us about his trip to Scotland many years ago.The room was clean and tidy and had everything we needed (apart from maybe an extra pillow 鈥?but I鈥檓 sure one would have been provided if we鈥檇 asked). There was some traffic noise at night but not enough to stop us sleeping - besides, this is the centre of Florence.Breakfast is buffet style (7.30 鈥?10.00am): bread rolls, croissants, meat, cheese, jams, cereals, juice and hot drinks 鈥?simple but adequate. Drinks can also be obtained during the day.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget who wants to be in the centre of Florence. We got a really good deal with Filcoo.com and stayed four nights for 200 euros. I would definitely stay at the Hotel Nizza again when/if I return to Florence.

<Content>Great location and value The location of this hotel is excellent. We stayed there 2 nights and found the owner to be very friendly. The hotel is a bit old, but the rooms were a decent size. The smell of cigarettes lingered throughout. I'm from California, so I was not used to it. They recently renovated their bathrooms, so it was clean. Despite it being clean, our bathroom had a musty smell. We drove to Florence against advice of many, but survived. Parking nearby is 24E. I think it is an excellent value. We got free breakfast (selection of rolls, lunch meat, cheese, jams, juice, tea, and coffee) with our hotel stay which was surprising. Stay here if you want to be within walking distance of the sights without forking over big bucks.

<Content>Fabulous value for money! We stayed for two nights at the Nizza at the end of July. We chose it because ot the rate and it proved to be a very good deal. The hotel is very centrally located, 3 minutes away from the train station. The owner was very nice and he was worried when we showed up late (parking problem). The room was clean and quiet. The breakfast was adequate. I would stay there again.

<Content>Good for the Money  On our tour of Italy, we stopped in Florence and decided to stay at Hotel Nizza. It was recommended by my source and it was said to be clean and in good location with soundproof windows, and a private bathroom. This was all true. It was not fancy at all, though the hotel reception (same middle aged man each day) had a very peculiar personality. He seemed extremely sensitive and highly defensive; bordering rude. In addition, (many of the hotels in Italy wanted to keep our passports for the day to record information at their leisure) he was visibly  verbally annoyed that I didn't want to leave my passport. Florence is VERY noisy, most of the time, and the windows were superb. Motel-like rooms with a hotel-like cleanliness. I guess I can't complain as it's in a good location, decently priced, very clean, and had noise-proof windows. No elavators. Have to lug your bags up 2 flights of stairs at the entrance before reaching front desk. Almost forgot; on Day 2, their hot water heater broke for our part of the hotel,  he made up remain in our room but carry our bathing items and shower in an unmade room in which someone just left that morning. I refused  demanded the use of a cleaned room to shower in. I feel badly for the incoming guests of that room because I doubt that they re-cleaned it.

<Content>Little Gem This hotel was fabulous value for money. It had aircon, television, breakfast ( never explained to us where it was!), great little bathroom, hairdryer (Ibring your own if you have a decent style or need volume!) but the general location could hardly have been better as was central for just about everything. Although on a main street and didn't have double glazing it really wasn't noisy and the man on reception was lovely, it was like having your dad waiting up for you every night! Could only have been made better by us speaking Italian or them speaking English!

<Content>Loved Hotel Nizza!! It's taken me a while to write this review - my partner and I stayed at Hotel Nizza back in January!! Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It's in a great position - 5-10 mins walk from the train station (great for those doing the Eurail thing, like us!) and 5 mins walk from the Duomo!! The staff were lovely - always had some kind of witty remark for us and could speak English! We had a very reasonable price of around 60 euro / night with breakfast - which was also quite reasonable! The room was simple, but clean and better than some other, more costly places. I'd recommend this place to anyone on a budget!

<Content>Disappointing experience Because we booked this hotel through a package deal, I can't say exactly if it was a good deal. I'm not sure what the breakdown for this specific hotel was. I saw one review mentioned 50-60 euro. However, of the three hotels we stayed in Italy, this one was the most disappointing. Maybe it's because the other hotels were fabulous, but I was not thrilled about this one. You definitely can not beat the location, it's true. It's near everything, as the reviewers said, and the day time staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. The rooms were clean, but I did smell the cleaning smell that someone else referred to. Also, my room was a stale pink color, not unlike Pepto Bismol, and rather dark (Our room opened out onto a noisy street and it was chilly, so opening the windows wasn't really an option) which depressed me. The ceramic tiles, though clean, were very cold and unpleasant for early spring. The bathroom was also smaller and an odd dusty blue color. The breakfast was rather paltry--again, maybe we were spoiled elsewhere. There was coffees from an automated machine (vs. espressos/caps made by staff or even coffee from a regular coffee maker), some dry crusty rolls with cheese and meats, and juice. I would say that if you are looking for value, based on other's comments, and not planning on worrying about much than a clean place to sleep, this is not a bad option. However, for me, this was not my desired place to return after a long day of touring around. Just to balance the review, my husband did say it was fine, that it was not luxurious, but it was clean and that's all he cared about.

<Content>Clean, friendly and well situated Six of us (3 couples) stayed here in Feb 2007. Its just 5 minutes walk from the main railway station, 5 minutes walk from the Duomo (the centre) and 2 minutes to San Lorenzo market.It's a very friendly, pleasant and clean hotel. Okay, it's not a 5 star tourist hotel but we were paying less than 50 pounds per couple per night and that included a very nice continental style breakfast with ham, cheese and fresh coffee. Some of the staff spoke English, some didn't, but that was never a problem as we could always make ourselves understood. There is some road noise if you are in a room overlooking the front, but it didn't bother myself or my wife. If you are looking for a late night drink then I suggest you use one of the many pubs and cafes that are only minutes away. The same goes for eating, there are plenty of places within a 2 or 3 minute walk.The big test with hotels is would I go back there. The answer to that is simple - YES - I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Florence

<Content>Good family hotel My wife and I have just returned from this hotel.The location is perfect. It is a two minute walk from Santa Novella train and bus station. Most of the places of historical interest are within a ten minute walk and all within a 20 minute walk.The rooms are of medium size, with large comfortable beds, high ceilings and air conditioned which will make them perfect throughout the hot summers.There is some street noise, but the heavy wooden shutters keep most of it out.The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. The continental breakfasts are simple but adequate.

<Content>Lots of good, toss in a bit of bad My fiancee and I stayed at the Hotel Nizza for three nights at the end of Sept 2006. Location is convenient in that it is only a few blocks from the train station (though it was a little tricky to find - our map told us to turn left instead of right onto the street). Of course, Florence is a walking town so you're close to everything if you're by the train station. Lots of little stores nearby to get a quick coffee, sandwich, bottle of wine, etc.I have to start by mentioning the front desk attendant - extremely friendly and helpful, willing to offer advice, providing suggestions on things to do without us soliciting them. Also, a bit of a smart alec which we both found very endearing. Overall, we both felt that the staff was rather exceptional. The room, without exaggerating, was one of the cleanest I have ever stayed in. It looked like it had recently been updated and we could not find a speck of dust anywhere. The tile floor could be eaten off of. The bathroom was lacking in shelf space, but he shower was of decent size for a European hotel. Another nice thing was that there was ample clothes storage. A few negatives - if you have a room facing the street, you absolutely will be woken up every day at around 7:00 when the traffic starts buzzing by. The room had a slightly pungent smell once or twice, possibly a cleaning chemical (maybe that's the price to pay for a clean room), breakfast selection was somewhat limited, beds were separate twins. Finally, the desk atttendant had told us that they lock the hotel at 8:00 but there is always a night watchman. He told us that we should tell the night attendant if we were going to be very late so he would expect us. On our way out one night, we did just this. He did not speak English so just pointed to a sign stating that the hotel is closed between the hours of 2:00 and 6:00. What? Does that mean you won't let us in? Anyway, we were out one night with some friends staying at another hotel and ended up having to cut our night short because of our curfew. Overall, the good outweighed the bad at this hotel for us and we do recommend it. The noise is really the only thing that we would caution people about. Not sure if they have rooms away from the street, but you should enquire.

<Content>Frantastic friendly family run hotel I could not have asked for anything better from this hotel. In florence for a conference in august, the whole city was busy and hot. My room was a cool calm oasis (high ceilings and AC). With a decent double bed, even in a supposed single room! The staff were friendly and kind, and recognised me every time. breakfast was good too, a basic buffet job. and the location is superb, on a quieter street just off from the hustle of the town centre.great.

<Content>Great Location My wife  stayed stayed at Hotel Nizza for 5 nights in late June. I would recommend this establishment for anyone who is looking for a place with clean rooms, a helpful staff and a great location. Very close to the train station and a short walk to major attractions such as the Duomo, Medici Chapel, Uffizzi  Academia. Several reasonable, good restaurants nearby. I would highly recommend Il Trebio, which is less than a 5 minute walk. The staff, especially Michele, was very helpful and the continental breakfast was good. Negatives were that the air conditioned room was very warm (the weather was unusually hot) and some traffic noise which we are not used to as we live in a rural area.

<Content>Great Little Place! My friend and I toured around Italy and booked this hotel before we left home. Nice little hotel, our rooms had 3 single beds in it, air conditioning (no cost) and a safe (no cost). Breakfast was continental, with juice, coffee, croissants, breads, jams. The guy at the front desk was very helpful (Roberto I think) and we even booked a tour through (Chianti Wine Tour)-highly recommended (a great 1/2 day tour!). I would go back to Hotel Nizza without hesitation.The only thing was we got lost finding this hotel, but a nice Italian gentleman showed us the way to it. When you exit the train station go the right (past the church) up one block and over a couple. Easy after you do it once!

Ok so the interiors aren't of 5 star quality but so what, your in florence, get outside and get an ice-cream or something. Great place situated smack in the centre of florence.

<Content>Nothing Special Pass on this family sized room unless you can鈥檛 find accommodation elsewhere. Except for proximity and rock bottom prices, this 2 star (not 3) Hotel has few redeeming qualities. The room has a twin bed and two singles in a 5 by 5 meter, plain white and tile room. A phone and tiny TV are provided with in-suite shower toilet that has linen (not terrycloth) towels. The dilapidated room overlooks the lobby entrance on a noisy street below. Parking is non-existent but a garage is available for 27 Euros per night located three blocks distant. Breakfast is provided but don鈥檛 expect a feast鈥攁 small portion of meat and some bread rolls with coffee and no service is to be expected. Bottom line: A solid 2 star performance.

The staff are really friendly, speak wonderful English and the hotels location couldn't be better.The rooms were reasonably big, were nice and cool and the hotel was extremley clean.This hotel was a lot better than a four star that I stayed in later in my trip.The only thing that I can see why it doesn't have a higher star status could be the absence of a lift, however this is not much of a problem. If you are visiting Florence than this has to be the hotel to stay in!

<Content>A Must Stay in Florence We loved the Hotel Nizza in Florence. After a very unpleasant first night in Florence we set out to find a reasonably priced hotel near the center of town. By accident we stumbled on this charming hotel. We were so warmly greeted everytime we walked in the door and up the stairs to the lobby. The personnel took a real interest in us, our plans, and lost luggage, rejoicing with us when it finally caught up to us at their hotel. They had a very good understanding of the English language and were helpful at giving directions and suggestions. Our rooms were comfortable and clean and breakfast was included in the 60 Euros a night price. What a deal!!
