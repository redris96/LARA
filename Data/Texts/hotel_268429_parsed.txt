<Content>Nice common area, rooms a bit small The location was great, right in Condado and within walking distance of everything. The common areas of the hotel were very nice, pretty good breakfast in the morning and good coffee. My only complaint is that the rooms (at least the one we were in) were very small. They were still nice inside however. Take advantage of the awesome community spaces, pools and spa.

<Content>Loved the Coral Princess! We had a destination wedding in San Juan, Puerto Rico in August 2008. We had about 40 guests, most of which stayed at the Coral Princess Inn for about a week. The Customer Service we received was absolutely stellar! The property is clean, modern...beautiful, it had a bed and breakfast feel, 2 blocks from Condado Beach AND affordable for our guests! It was great for families, the children loved it as well. With so many guests arriving at different days and times as well as some room changes, the staff were always accomodating and happy to assist with anything they could. I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples looking for a romantic getaway and families looking for an affordable option in the Condado area of San Juan.

<Content>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Coral Princess Inn We booked the Coral Princess Inn based upon the reviews on this site. We were going on a cruise which left on Sunday November 16 but we wanted to have some time in San Juan prior to the cruise. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They arranged for a trip to the bioluminescent bay for us. The accomodations were quite nice. The room was quiet and clean. They actually upgraded us to a larger room upon arrival. Our room had an LCD TV mounted on the wall and a Wi-Fi connection. The hotel is centrally located so we didn't have far to walk to the beach (about two blocks) or to nearby stores. (Walgreen's was right on the corner) They offered a continental breakfast in the morning where you could eat outside on a lovely patio. There also is a small inground pool at the Coral Princess Inn. We would most certainly stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel to couples and singles.

<Content>Cute and convenient We spent two nights before a trip to eastern Puerto Rico and three nights after at this cute little hotel in Condado and had a very nice stay. There's nothing spectacular about the hotel, but it's quite pleasant and much more affordable than other comparable options.The rooms have nice marble floors, large whirlpool tubs, (small) flat screen tvs with cable, internet connections, ceiling fans, high-powered AC units, and the in-room minibars are wine fridges with enough space to add a few items of your own. The hotel also offers a better-than-average breakfast, a very small but cute pool, a rooftop jacuzzi, on-site laundry facilities (one coin-operated washer and dryer, $2 each), several very pleasant sitting areas, both inside and out, and friendly staff. The hotel is within a few blocks of a beach, lots of restaurants, a 24-hour Walgreens, a post office, a bus stop to Old San Juan (about a 10-minute ride), and several bigger hotel/resort/casinos, and is about 5 or 6 blocks from the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Puerto Rico.The rooms are small, but not uncomfortably so. The mattresses in the two rooms we stayed in were not uncomfortable at first, but their lack of firm support made them a bit hard on my back after a night or two. The bathtubs are lovely but there's no water pressure at all in the showers.So, if you're planning to explore San Juan, and particularly if you're more interested in exploring Old San Juan and Puerto Rican art, culture, history and cuisine than lying on pristine beaches, this hotel will meet all your needs nicely, conveniently, and affordably. If you want to spend a lot of time luxuriating in your room and in your hotel, this is not where you want to stay--there's no in-house restaurant or bar  hence no room service, and there's no view from your window. The beach that's a two-minute walk from the hotel is ok but it's not great: there's plenty of space for swimming, but it's lined with kind of low-to-mid-range hotels and resorts and abandoned, sometimes dilapidated, buildings. Playa Condado is not too far away, either--maybe a 10- or 15-minute walk west down Ashford Ave. It's nicer but sandwiched between a hotel and a very busy bridge; it also has lots of rocks and seaweed/sea grass and is very, very small. If beaches are your focus in San Juan, you'll be disappointed; if you'd just like to visit beaches occasionally amidst other activities, this cute, friendly hotel should suit you well.

<Content>An excellent stay... cleanliness, hospitality, convenience, and bearly affordabl Coral Princess Inn is hands down one of the best experiences when it comes to the following:1.) Customer service 鈥?excellent!!!2.) Cleanliness 鈥?excellent cleanliness鈥?zero complaints!3.) Comfort 鈥?very good. They could use newer and better quality mattresses though. A harder mattress is preferred.4.) Value for money鈥?the room should go for U$110.00 + tax. That鈥檚 plenty for this hotel given the location, time of year, and overall what one receives in exchange. Thank you Luis, thank you Karina, and thank you the support staff at thip your property for making my stay refreshing. The hot water works, the Internet works, and air-conditioner. In addition, a full panel of Cable TV ... comprehensive. This hotel gets a Grade A. They just need to lower their prices to not exceed U$110.00 out the door. Even U$125.00 out the door is ok. U$155.00 is too much even during high season.

<Content>A GREAT PLACE We stayed at this property in 11/08 for 2 nights pre-cruise and then again 3 nights post-cruise. What a wonderful little inn this is!Warm hospitality, clean, quiet and centrally located. Rooms may be a little on the small side, but are well appointed and are very clean and well maintained.Their continental breakfast is very good - not just toast  coffee - and exceeded our expectations. Front desk staff and management seemed to go out of their way to make us feel welcome and to provide restaurant and sightseeing hints and opinions.I would recommend this nice little inn to anyone who is NOT looking for the swim-up bars (and $400/night rate) of the resort properties.

<Content>A great little hotel While looking for a nice hotel at a reasonable rate. I found this one. I am a travel agent who was looking for something in a good location and a great value for the price. We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights after arriving in San Juan after a cruise from New York City I read the reviews on trip advisor. So I booked 3 rooms at the hotel for 6 people. It was everything I thought it would be after reading the reviews and seeing pictures of the property. They gave us 3 rooms near each other on the same floor. We had arrived a bit early for check-in from the ship. The staff was very accomodating and held our luggage until our rooms were ready. . We were able to walk to area reataurants for dinner and to Walgreens to get drinks and snacks since we were there for 2 days. The beach was a short walk, just 2 blocks away. The hotel was very relaxing, clean and quiet, relaxing pool, with decent continetal breakfast. I would recommend this property to other travelers and would stay there again.

<Content>Comfortable, Clean, very nice staff....Wonderful place to stay!!! Just returned from a trip to Puerto Rico. When planning the trip we searched on line for hotels, when we came across the Coral Princess Inn, we read the reviews, looked at the photos  booked the room. It sounded like just what we were looking for...and I must say We were absolutely happy with our stayIt is very cozy  not anything like a big hotel..which was what we were looking for. Very clean, and nice decor throughout the Inn. The staff was attentive and when we needed assistance they were very helpful. Rooms were kept at a very nice temperature, since it was HOT  Humid. Beds were comfortable, flat screen tv, jacuzzi tub, and again nice furniture. Lots of potted plants, game room, little library, pool, hot tub and areas where you can just sit outside if you'd like and relax. The location is great...one block from Ashford st. We were able to walk to the park or beach in about 5min. enjoy the shops, restuarants and or Casinos.. on Ashford St.I'd stay there again...

<Content>Great place, bed and breakfast feel to it Great place to stay. We had room 14, which was very big and super clean. Tiled throughout. Air conditioner was very powerful, so if you like it cold, you can have it that way. Flat screen TV in the room, which was a nice touch. The breakfast is served in the back in a nice courtyard with lots of plants. Nothing too fancy to eat, but adequate. The staff was also very nice. Gave suggestions on where to eat (a cafe on the parallel street called Cafe del Angel) and which buses to take around. We were able to leave our bags at the hotel while we did some exploring and when we came back a little early for our cruise we were able to sit in their reading room. The manager was super nice and offered to drive us to the port as well! Totally unexpected and a great surprise.

<Content>Worthy Alternative to Oceanfront Hotel Stayed here for two nights pre-cruise. Taxi from Airport is under $20 and to Pan American Pier was under $15. Staff was helpful. Room was big enough, with minibar and TV. Excellent bathroom - marble tile and full-size tub. When we noticed there was no safe in the room, the front desk arranged to have one placed in our room. Location is very convenient to beach, Marriott Stellaris, restaurants and is located on the bus route to Old San Juan (bus was free, as was trolley in OSJ).This is an excellent place to stay for a short visit if you don't plan to spend a lot of time in your hotel. While the public areas are nice, most are small. Pool area was crowded with four people. Rooftop jacuzzi is very nice, as is the complimentary breakfast (note that the hotel added a $10 convenience charge on top of room rate and taxes for breakfast, access to phone and pool, etc.).

<Content>Wonderful hotel My husband and I recently returned from a one night stay at the Coral Princess Inn after our cruise. We were looking forward to staying at this hotel as the reviews were all very good. We arrived at the hotel prior to check in and were told that our rooms would be ready by 1:00 and that we could put our luggage in the luggage room. We did so and headed out for lunch. The hotel is located in a residential area and has tons of restaurants and stores near by. There is a Walgreens walking distance which is also very nice. After lunch we checked into our room. We were given room #2. The room felt like a room in your home. It was very comfortable. The room was not huge ( I bruised up my leg walking around the bed) but very nicely decorated and very clean. There is a snack fridge in the room and actually they do not overcharge you for anything in it. The bathroom was also a very nice size. There was a flat screen t.v. on the wall and the bed was very comfortable. We did not take advantage of the complimentary breakfast but the breakfast area and the rest of the grounds were very nice. We would both definitely stay at the Coral Princess Inn again.

<Content>Would Definitely Stay Again! Our group (3 middle-aged couples) stayed here two nights pre-cruise in March (admittedly, this review is late!). We have to travel on a budget, and, after reading the Tripadvisor reviews, decided to give it a try. We were more than satisfied. The rooms were not fancy but clean. We loved the public areas. The continental breakfast was served in a lovely courtyard area--pretty and peaceful and a great way to gear up for your day. The rooftop terrace was perfect for winding down at night after a long day of sightseeing. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We did have some problems getting our reservations straightened out (in advance of our arrival) but the staff was extremely apologetic and finally fixed the problem. The location was convenient. Of course, we would have loved to have had a beachfront hotel with an ocean view, but for the price, we could not have asked for more. We are looking forward to going back.

First, the staff is incredibly helpful, andswers questions, and gave us storage space for our luggage, hailed our cabs for us, all at a one person desk. Housekeeping is excellent as well.The rooms are nice, well described in the pictures posted on this website. The breakfast is passable, the coffee is excellent. It is close to all the action in Condado-- a good place to eat around the corner, a couple of blocks from most of the casinos and place to eat. Would stay there again

Very reasonably priced and immaculately clean hotel, just perfectly off the main hustle and bustle of the area. All the nightlife you want is just a walk away. What most impressed me was how comfortable the accommodations are and impressively clean and neat. Breakfast is nice, staff is very friendly, and I woke up to a smile every day.

<Content>Coral Princess--A Respite before Returning to Reality Staying here after a cruise was a restful bridge before returning home. We disembarked the ship and arrived at the hotel before we could check in, but there was a room for storing our luggage and a restroom so we could change and enjoy the small pool and the breezeway where we relaxed until our room was ready. Marcia, the desk clerk, was extremely helpful and friendly. Our attractive room was very comfortable with a much welcome working ac and ceiling fan. The stairs were difficult to navigate with our luggage, but that is the only negative I could post. The room was very clean as was the bath. It felt like a place of retreat and warmth and I would have enjoyed staying another day just lazing around and looking at the beautiful orchids in bloom in the walkway area. This was not an ornate or extravagant hotel--but one with its own charm.

<Content>Nice Room, Great Rate! After reading all the reviews on the Coral Princess, I was pleased to find this hotel delivers what most positive reviews had to say. Overall, it was a very charming hotel that will definitely stay on my short list of favorites in the San Juan area.I was traveling single and I stayed in room 19. It was one of the smaller rooms, but still very adequate. The room was very clean and room service was dependable. The ceiling fan worked great - so much that I could go without the air condition at night.Here are a few things I didn't see in other reviews that might be helpful. There is 24 hour security at the front desk, someone has to buzz you in at all times of the day. I felt very secure, but it was inconvenient one night about 3am when I had to wait about 5 minutes for the attendent to return to the desk.They have a very convenient room 11, where you can leave your bags before or after checkout. This room is also equiped with a bathroom and shower so you can get cleaned up before heading to the airport if you have a late flight.There is a refrigerator in each room, but it is fully stocked and the hotel charges very convenient prices for their refreshments. There was a Walgreens around the corner. I bought my own refreshements, but they still attempted to charge me for items from the wet bar at the end of my stay.The only complaint I had would be a general hotel gripe: the room door was not very soundproof and you can hear noise out in the hallway. There were a couple of times I was awakened by the child across the hall, but that did not take away from the overall experience.

<Content>A princess stay at the Coral Princess Inn!! Date May 27th 2008Reviewers: Mr.  Mrs. Zutter, Calgary, Alberta, CanadaWe stayed at the Coral Princess Inn for one night on May 17th, and we absolutely loved this little inn full of enchantment.We went to Puerto Rico, on a long awaited honeymoon, we got married on Oct of 2001 but due to a lot of different circumstances we were not able to go on a honeymoon trip.This year we were finally able to take the time and have the finances to do so, and we wanted this trip to be PERFECT. We booked a state room in the Carnival Destiny departing San Juan late on Sunday May 18th, and we decided that we would travel the Friday before so we would have 2 days in Puerto Rico, we had just taken our in classroom and pool Scuba course and we only needed to take the 4 Open Water Classes to finish our Certification and we wanted to do this in San Juan before the trip. I was looking for a small hotel that would offer great service and be personable, since my husband and I both like to experience the culture of the countries we travel to, and I have to say that Coral Princess Inn did not disappoint!!Here is what I mean by this, we arrived in San Juan at 8:30 AM that morning, the check in wasn't untill 2:00 PM, and we were going straight to La Casa Del Buzo to go on our first 2 Open water classes as soon as we arrived, for this matter and because we couldn't wait around for check in at 2:00 pm, the hotel let us put our luggage in a small room that had a shower and that could be locked so we wouldn鈥檛 have to worry about our stuff, they also let us use their phone as many times as we needed to call the Scuba store (the lad that took my call from Calgary had not booked us in for the classes and the owner of 鈥淟a Casa del Buzo鈥?very promptly found us an instructor to take my husband and I out for the dives) so we had to call back and forth to arrange this, we went off and did our first 2 dives and by the time we came back our room was ready and front desk had us checked in, in a couple of minutes, the room was very clean and comfortable we never had any problems with water pressure or anything, it is not a luxury hotel but we were static about our accommodations, all the employees were super friendly and helpful, and they were quick to give directions to places and help with anything we needed.The little hotel has a beautiful indoor patio, a little pool, as well as a Jacuzzi tub on the terrace, we didn鈥檛 get to use them but they looked clean and attractive under the heat of the day! The location of The Coral Princess Inn is also very convenient, the beach is a couple of blocks away which is a long golden strip bordered by beautiful hotels, and a sea as blue as the summer sky, there is also a 24 hour Walgreens half a block away were you can purchase from toiletries to water bottles, to anything you find you need in a hurry. There is also a lot of small stores including a Subway restaurant, photo stores, liquor stores, and much much more, just in the blocks around the hotel, take a walk and immerse yourself in the Puerto Rican culture of music, laughter and camaraderie.A short walk away there is a little restaurant called 鈥淟a Ropa Vieja鈥?that served us with impeccable curtsey and if you are a Risotto lover PLEASE try their Shrimp Risotto, Oh!! I have never tasted something as decadent!!! Both my husband and I had to meet the cook, as this was the best Risotto we ever tasted!!The next morning we had to check out at 11:00 am, and since we had to leave around 8:00 am to go do our last 2 Scuba classes, front desk let us check out early and let us keep our suitcases in the little room under lock again, we left for the whole day and didn鈥檛 worry about loosing our stuff or having to keep our huge luggage in the heat in our Scuba instructor鈥檚 car鈥?when we came back we were able to use the shower in that little room, change and get ready to board our Cruise ship!!All in all I LOVED this little hotel that is so conveniently located, and has helpful and friendly staff. We would definitely stay there again and we will recommend it without a problem! They made our 2 days in Puerto Rico the stay of a lifetime!! And the perfect start to our 7 day Southern Caribbean Cruise vacation!!

<Content>Coral Princess - Convenient and Clean We stayed at the Coral Princess from May 2-4, 2008 for a weekend getaway.- Location: Ideally situated a block from Condado Beach and near many small restaurants (loved Cafe Del Angel). Easy bus ride on the B21 to Old San Juan. - Cleanliness: Mostly very clean. Bathroom was spotless. Only complaints were that the fan in our room was covered in dust and the rooftop hot tub's water smelled funky and needed a cleaning. - Room: Room 16 is small, but clean and quiet, on the second floor overlooking the lovely courtyard with plants and a small, but very clean pool. It has a jacuzzi tub. - Breakfast: Breakfast was adequate, but nothing to write home about. - Service: The staff was very helpful, even letting us store our stuff in a room with a shower on the last day -- our flight didn't leave until late in the day. Overall, Coral Princess was a great choice for the price. I would stay here again. The only complaints were the dirty hot tub and fan.

<Content>Definitely recommend Stayed for 5 nights based on the good reviews on this site. Was one of the best deals in San Juan, even with the substantial taxes/fees added (which are listed in the confirmation email as a final price). The rooms were larger than I expected from what I had read. Small flat-screen TV with a bunch of channels for pre-bed dozing off. The pool is small but useful. The rooftop hot tub is hit or miss as it wasn't always working. Breakfast was basic (from Costco) but enough to get you going in the morning. The staff was very helpful and one maintenance issue that appeared was resolved immediately. It was possible to find parking always either in front of the hotel or on side streets so never had to pay extra. And the location is very convenient for Condado, which seems to be rapidly expanding. Lots of restaurants and shops around, including a very useful Walgreens one block away. Cab fare to downtown San Juan was $12 if you don't feel like driving (didn't try the bus). Overall, this hotel is a good value in a good location, so I would definitely recommend it for visitors to Puerto Rico.

<Content>An excellent choice in Condado We were in San Juan for a mix of business and sightseeing. This was ideal. The inn is close to the beach, restaurants, convenience stores, a pharmacy, casinos, and trendy shopping. The staff became our friends--they were very open and helpful. Old San Juan is an easy 10-minute, 75-cent bus ride away (buses are not on predictable schedules, though).You would be hard pressed to find a more reasonable price in this area.We will return!

<Content>Coral Princess Inn We enjoyed our stay at The Coral Princess. It was our last hotel of the trip and overall it was a nice place, but I was expecting more. The hotel does add a lot of taxes and charges though, so be aware of that. It was almost the price of another night. The patios and balconys were wonderful. The room was nice, though a little dirtier than I expected, but still not bad. The bathroom was the worst part, but still very manageable. A little bit of mildew and it just looked older, like it should be retiled and regrouted. We were a little bored in this part of town though. Nightlife is pretty lacking if you don't feel like getting ripped off at the casinos and not really that many places to eat as far as variety goes. There is a huge Chili's down the street, but that just isn't a place we travel to Puerto Rico to eat at. The beaches are great though, we really enjoyed them.

<Content>Excellent atmosphere at Coral Princess Our party of 6 stayed for 3 nights at the Coral Princess Inn,in early April.It is small and quaint but clean and in a good location.The staff were informative and competent.The rooms were clean but really tiny;our suitcases had to be pushed into corners between the bed and the wall ,but we overlooked that small inconvenience since there were so many positive things.While our room,(room 3) was tiny,(with a tiny window over the bed that looked out onto a corridor)one of the other couples had room 4,which was much bigger for the same rate.It had a window that looked outside.The couple that had room 8 near the breakfast area also ended up in cramped quarters,but like us,considered it a minor inconvenience.The breakfast(which was included with the cost of the room)was more than adequate for our needs and the casual atmosphere was lovely.We could make our own toast/bagels,tea/etc.,choose what we wanted(cheese slices,ham slices,pastries,yogurt,fruit,etc)and then sit in the courtyard while we ate,and listened to the birdsong.We absolutely loved it!The pool was very small but the beach was only a few minutes away;right across the road.On the third floor there is a hot tub that is open till 9 P.M. (though the staff allowed my friends and I to stay in until 11,which was considerate).The food at the nearby Cafe Angel(try the mofongo if you want a taste of the national dish)was excellent;reasonably priced and huge portions.Also the Black Angus Steakhouse serves the best steaks that you could ever ask for.There is a Walgreens around the corner.If you want to go to Old San Juan or the mall(The Plaza of the Americas)you don't need to waste your money on a cab;the B21 bus runs right near the inn and drops you off there as well(every 20 minutes).It costs just .75 cents each way.The exact change is required.Overall,I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who is budget conscious and just wants somewhere clean and homey to stay for a short time.It is no Hilton,but then you don't pay Hilton prices either. At 125.00 a night it's not bad,as rates go in San Juan.

<Content>The value just wasn't there... I saw all of the good reviews on trip advisor for this hotel and started to search around for prices. I found them listed on hotels.com with a price of $115 per night, but no mention of the bed size, and we wanted a queen or bigger. I decided to contact the hotel directly and they offered me a queen bed at $135 a night, which seemed a little high, but I decided the extra $20 per night would be okay. Watch out for the additional fees, though. They charged an additional $9.00 per day as a maintenance fee or something like that, and there is a 14% tax on top of that. We ended up paying $682 for 4 nights, or $170 per night. Now, I was looking for a small, quaint hotel that would bring with it the charm of the local community, and a sense that we were experiencing a part of Puerto Rico. This hotel just didn't offer that. This was a $100 per night hotel at best. For $170 a night, we shouldn't have had the following problems: The first night there, the water would only turn on cold. There were 2 of us, and we turned the knobs every which way trying to get hot water in the shower. Finally, we asked at the desk. They agreed to look at it in the morning while we had breakfast. After, they brought us in, and showed us how to turn the knob and said the hot water was working all along. There is no way it was working prior to that. Why couldn't they just apologize for having to turn on the water heater? In addition, after breakfast, we brought our coffee back into the room with us while we were getting ready. When they cleaned the room, they didn't remove the empty, used coffee cups. For the price we were paying, I would expect the room to be perfect when we returned for the evening. I ended up having to bring 2 days of coffee cups back out to the breakfast area myself. I know these things seem small, and I would overlook them for a less expensive hotel, but I know there are other hotels in the area that provide better service for the same price. (I had previously stayed at the Wind Chimes Inn and would have booked there again, if they weren't all filled up.) The good things: the courtyard for breakfast was beautiful, but don't expect anything very healthy (yogurt with lots of sugar, pastries, and processed cheese and ham... they also had cereal, but only cornflakes.) The bed was the right size, but it was just outside the courtyard, so when people would congregate for breakfast, they woke us up every morning. No need to set an alarm! The rooms were cleaned well except for the coffee cup issue, and the location was great.If you are going to stay here, I would ask NOT to have a room near the courtyard, and be careful about pricing. I see another post here that states a room with a king bed was only $125 a night. I don't know why my price was higher. They also recommend that you tip the maid $3 per day. I usually tip the maid, anyway, but I just felt like they were nickle and diming me with this suggested tip as well. Make it $173 per night. I have never given a bad review to a hotel on trip advisor before, and I still highly recommend Wind Chimes Inn if you are looking for a hotel in the Condado area. I felt the service and the people there were wonderful, and I didn't feel like I was getting less value for my money.

<Content>Nice location while visiting San Juan My family of four recently stayed at the Coral Princess Inn which is conveniently located in Condado. It is easy to catch a bus or cab to Old San Juan from this location. The beach is a short walk away and there are many restaurants to choose from. Our room with one queen size bed was very small, especially when we added the roll away mattress. If I knew how small the room was I would have reserved a different one. The room was clean however and we didn't have problems with the hot water supply when we wanted it. The property is maintained nicely with many tropical plants. The area where breakfast is served is very nice. They offer the standard continental food and drinks. They also have a piano for the guests and a quiet reading room. The pool is very small but my kids still enjoyed it very much. They also have a hot tub on the upper level but you need to walk through the penthouse suite to get to it. Overall our experience was good while staying here and I would select it again if we return to San Juan.

<Content>Suited Our Needs Party - two adults, two teenagers, two children Paid - $125 for a king, $145 for room with two queensPurpose - two night stay in San Juan as part of a Puerto Rico visit for spring break.Pros - small size with pretty courtyard had exotic, boutique feel to it: people at front desk friendly and helpful: easy, safe walk to restaurants and shopping - went to Cafe de Angel with reasonably priced local cuisine, second night kids opted for fast food and adults ate at the outdoor tapas spot at La Concha - pricey but neat setting;Included breakfast - very convenient for group that rises at different times; kids liked rooftop hot tub; rooms were quiet (back of property #24 and 25) and had no problems with AC or hot water (had to turn tub knob opposite what it appeared).Cons - pool small and brisk; morning coffee just plain weak

<Content>We all wish to be in hot water--at least in a hotel room! For me one of the basics of any hotel is hot water--well, when my wife and I stayed there the end of March there was none at any time of day or night that I turned on a faucet--maybe warm (maybe not), but never hot. the water pressure was also so low that it took 20 minutes of full-force (???) to just barely clear the jets in the whirlpool tub, but since the water was the temperature it was, I stopped there and never did fill it. I did complain at the desk and, of course, you know what the result of that was--we'll have someone check it, but, of course, if anyone did, it made no difference.I could say some things were ok, but some things are always ok. for the price, definitely should have been better.

<Content>Coral Princess a let-down We stayed in the Penthouse suite for one quick night, and on first impression it was very cool! Definitely a smooth decor: very modern. The whole hotel has a random chic appearance with antique furniture blended with bold colorful paintings and modern lines. Only upon settling in did we begin to be disappointed. The toilet paper, a priority for my D.H., was the cheapest quality one could purchase, the shower was plumbed directly into the jacuzzi tub, which was a little awkward to step in or out of, there were cheap soaps and, a female's favorite, conditioning shampoo. I don't know a female that doesn't appreciate conditioner!! There weren't even kleenex in the room! The cheap t.p. had to suffice! There were doors that opened directly onto the roof-top deck that had no instructions and were impossible to open. The a.c. was an individual unit mounted on the wall controlled by a remote that, apparently, had been dropped so the LCD screen was unreadable. I spent the night either roasting or freezing not being able to find a happy medium. Another disappointment for me was that the hotel was a $12 (one way) cab fare away from Old San Juan. The last, but not least, missing commodity in our PENThouse sute was an alarm clock!!!! All that said, the bed was very comfy, the staff friendly and the hotel fairly clean. Probably wouldn't stay there again, or wouldn't pay *$200* dollars for maybe what a lesser room would've offered.

<Content>OK, but felt scammed when i left. Just stayed in Coral Princess last 3 days, really nothing special, I looked next door at the Consulate hotel, a few more bucks and it鈥檚 a lot nicer.Location on Condado is excellent. Rooms showed wear and tear, air con works either ice box mode or nothing.Hotel was not forthright about there true room rate, and at end of stay they added 10 bucks a day for nothing.When I asked about it, I was told it was for the Internet and TV which on web says is included. Bottom-line, I would be careful these guys seem to just want to nickel and dime, which is too bad, I guess they think no one tells anyone about these little extras.

<Content>the informal place to stay very nice experience in this small hotel, would say rather guest house. The room (suite) was very comfortable, located at the rear, so more quiet. Breakfast in the patio with a lot of exotic plants, is a kind of refreshing simplicity. One thing i want to add about our San Juan experience is the lack of serious concerning the common transportation, i mean bus : we have waited about 45 minutes for a bus to the Old San Juan on a saturday morning and finally we had to take a taxi. And don't forget to talk about the cost before, usually 12 dollars, otherway you could be charge untill 16 or 18 dollars. It's a shame and as i have discussed with a loco people, the taxi syndicate is powerfull and they are opposed to the creation of a direct line from the airport to downtown ...

<Content>Great find We changed reservations and selected this hotel after reading reviews in Tripadvisor and Frommer's. The hotel was lovely with beautiful plantings and nice furnishings. The staff was uniformly helpful. The rooms were large enough and the bathroom, while small, had a jetted (standard size) tub as well as a shower. We especially like going to the roof after a day of sightseeing and soaking in the hot tub. The Coral Princess is in a good location with just a short walk to many restuarants or the bus stop, which provides easy access to Old San Juan. There is a rocky beach within a few blocks, but ask about the truly lovely beach slightly farther away which is next to another large hotel. Because of that hotel being there lounge chairs, towels and umbrellas can be rented on the beach, lunch can be order from wait staff who come to the beach and deliver and the very nice changing facilities and showers are open to the public.The breakfast was adequate, but nothing more. We were dissapointed that there was never any Caribbean fruit (only bananas). The pastries, yogurt and such were all from Costco. It was fine, but nothing special.We spent four night here and would not hesitate to return when we come back to Puerto Rico. A very good value for the money.

<Content>Great Size, Great Location My girlfriend and I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Coral Princess Inn. The hotel itself and the service were great! Everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure that our stay was the most enjoyable that it could be. The room (#15) was clean and in good condition. The self-service breakfast was good and had enough variety to keep us satisfied. The hotel is located 2 blocks from the beach, and just one block from everything on Ashford. The 3rd floor deck was very nice to be out on. The pool was a little small, but we were never really at the hotel during the day, so that didn't matter much to us. We were pleased with staying in Condado, seeing as it was nestled right in the middle of OSJ and Isla Verde. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to anyone looking to get away from the larger resorts.

<Content>Not that great I was not at all impressed by this hotel or its location. My friend and I stayed there 2 nights and due to a booking error had to switch rooms after the first night. The first room supposedly had a queen sized bed (was actually a full) and the shower had no hot water and very little water pressure. The second room was better but not as great as the reviews lead me to expect. Location: Condado, at least where this hotel is located, is run down and the beach nearby is nothing to write home about. It's a 20 minute bus ride to Old San Juan - that's if the bus comes at all. My friend and I waited 40 minutes one day and finally got in a dollar van ($2 per person for 5+ people). A private taxi will cost you around $16. Overall, a disappointing experience.

The hotel is small and charming...exactly what we wanted! If you want a hotel with charm, that's in a good location, and for a great price...this is the place to stay. Yes, the rooms are a little small, but we weren't staying in San Juan to hang out in the room! We loved the beautiful patio that is surrounded by flowers...it was a great place for breakfast. The staff was very helpful in helping us with transportation and making recommendations. I would stay here again!

Mind you, not that the Hotel was bad, on the contrary: it is clean and the rooms are ok. Nothing more. I cannot honestly say that I'll tell my grandchildren stories about my magnificent stay at the Coral Pricess Inn as many other users . Said that, I would recommend it my friends, Price and location are good and hotel is ok.

I was first assigned to the very front room of the second floor ( I forgot the number, is it 12?), but the AC did not work well. Of course I asked to change to another room and the staff did it.Otherwise, I found this hotel lovely and fantastic!The breakfast is simple, however, I have no complaints on it!

<Content>Very good stay We stayed here prior to a cruise. The room and staff were very good and the breakfast was very adequate. Rather than take a cab to Old San Juan there is a bus stop about a block away and for $.75 take the B21 bus to the end of the line and you are in Old San Juan. On the return trip get the bus at the terminal, again $.75 where you got off, and ask the driver to let you off at the Marriott. You will be almost in front of the Coral Princess. The bus driver doesn't make change.

<Content>Great little inn close to the action. My husband and I recently spent 2 nights at this inn. It is just one block off the main street in Condada, meaning it's close to the shopping, restuarants, casinos and beach. Our room was on the small side, but very comfortable. Our room did have a tub/shower combo and the tub was a small whirlpool tub. The only complaint I have and it's not a big one is with the shower water. The pressure was low and it would go from comfortable to hot to cold and back and forth. Our room also had a fridge that was prestocked with water sodas ($1 each), beer ($2 each), and wine ($25 each). There was also room to add your own beverages. The front desk were very friendly and helpful with their suggestions. The continental breakfast was sufficient and consisted of cereal, croissants, and various other pastries. The location was great and the price was affordable. If we return to San Juan, we will definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>Nice hotel, close to the beach I stayed in this hotel with my wife and small daughter for 8 days at the end of December. This is a clean and well-kept hotel with modern furniture in the rooms, flat-screen TV's with over 100 free cable channels, and a wine fridge in every room. A basic continental breakfast is included in the price. There is a jacuzzi in a nice terrace patio in the third floor that is open until 9 pm in the evening. There is also a small pool in the first floor of the hotel, but it's not very sunny there. As far as we can tell, this is not a chain hotel, which is good because the staff were that much more friendly. We asked for a crib for our daughter and were provided with one free of charge. There is a very good Argentinian restaurant called Buenos Ayres just down the street with very tasty food and large portions at a moderate price ($18 to $25 per main dish). The beach is two blocks away. NOTE OF CAUTION: if you go to San Juan (or most other places on the north shore) during the winter months from December to March, the ocean rough - the waves are strong and the undertow is powerful. While we were in Condado beach we saw an emergency situation in which a person got too far out from the shore and had to be rescued by several other people. Afterwards we were told by some locals that this (and worse) happens several times each winter. Be careful.

We were given room # 8 which is right beside the breakfast area. The room was small and the noise from the breakfast area started up at 5:00 am. As we got in late I was not impressed.

<Content>It was great... We booked the Coral Princess for one night pre-cruise. Upon arriving to the Inn, they told us we were upgraded to the pent house suite. Wow- we're never that lucky. Large, spacious room , lots of marble, jacuzzi/shower combo. View isn't great, Condado is up and coming, some of the buildings are rough. We found a neat little resturant nearby called Latin Star. Yum. The staff at the Coral Princess are very knowledgable and friendly. They held our luggage the following morning after checkout so we could check out the area, and go to the beach. The beach by the way was rough, and not conducive to swimming. There are some impressive stores also very near, Ferragamo, Vuitton, Dior, etc if your budget allows. The complimentary breakfast was just as described by others. Plenty of choice, and a nice atmosphere in which to enjoy. Would stay with them again. About 15 minutes to the cruise pier via taxi.

<Content>Overrated - Just Ok I can't believe all of the stunning reviews this place got. It is very very average. Cons:The rooms are extremely small....felt more like a tiney bedroom than a hotel room. At first glance the room looked clean, however I felt like I could not walk around and shower without flip flops. Our sink was clogged and took a while to drain each time we used it. Breakfast was TERRIBLE. Basically it's a tray of ham and cheese, yogurt, croissant (which had mold on it) and juice.Pros:Front desk was nice and helpful.They allowed us to shower and change in the hotel when we got back from the beach after we checked out (had a late flight)Location was pretty good. About 3 blocks from an ok beach. Condado beach is not a typical Carribean beach. Some trash scattered around, water is not calm...lots of waves. No big deal...just an FYI.Doing this trip again I would stay at The Marriott (one block away from Coral Princess). It's beach front and much nicer inside.

Me and my husband spent 3 nights here and we really enjoyed our stay. My husband even thanked me for finding such a nice clean hotel that's centrally located that suits our budget.The hotel is very clean. Receptionists are nice and helpful. And the location is just perfect...very close to a lot of restaurants, the beach and old san juan. It was our first time in Puerto Rico, and I'm glad that we stayed here...We ate at the Cherry Blossoms japanese/chinese restaurant...it was the freshest sushi we had...and the service is very good.Our second night...we did the biobay kayak tour in fajardo...everyone should try this ...it felt like it was a dream...the water was very warm eventhough it was a breezy night...it was along drive though to fajardo.I will really recommend this place to eveybody!!!

<Content>Awesome affordable boutique hotel!!! This was the perfect relaxing affordable boutique hotel after our long cruise to the Caribbean!!! Clean, comfortable, beautiful, well decorated, excellent service and great contintentall breakfast. The staff was very accommodating when we showed up at 9 am after getting off the cruise ship and arriving at the hotel to stay for one last night before heading back to Chicago. They let us store our luggage, change into our swim suits, use the pool and enjoy their continental breakfast even though we were about 4-5 hours too early to check in. The did the same when we weren't leaving until 2 pm the next day to go to the airport.We walked about 5 minutes down the street to 2 great restaurants overlooking the crashing waves and beach, Wakiki and La Hacienda right nextdoor. There are also high-end primo shops along the way. After being exhausted from our cruise, we decided to vegg out in the room watching football, drinking beer and order a pizza one night. It was one of the best pizza's we'd ever had from a place down the street called Mike  Charlies!! Made with all super fresh ingredients.The rooms are a little on the small side, but the super tall ceilings, cute decor and all the amenities you really need for a comfortable stay are there. My husband and I will for sure stay there if we're ever in PR again!-Chicago, IL

<Content>Nice stay The hotel itself is clean and affordable, however the air conditioners do not have temperature sensors, so they run all night long. However, if your room is by the breakfast area, that will be a saving grace. It can get loud early in the morning. The location was great, most times you can share a cab with others going to Old San Juan (plan on $15 each way...10 minute ride). The bus stop is close and it is .075 cents, but I am not sure how reliable they are...one couple waited over an hour. The breakfast was like any normal continental breakfast...nothing spectacular.There are lots of good restaurants in Condado too.

<Content>Loved the Coral Princess Date: Oct. 8, 2007Reviewer: E Hawk, South Carolina, USAMy wife and I stayed overnight at the Coral Princess while waiting on a cruise. We wish we could have stayed longer. The hotel is an excellent value, and the staff could not have been more pleasant. The only negative is that the rooms are a bit small. But, they are VERY comfortable, and totally clean. The A/C worked perfectly, which is an important item judging by reviews of other places. Internet service is available in the room, and the TV, while small, has plenty of channels and great reception. The area offers so much to do, you may not watch much. We didn't.The area is loaded with restaurants. We'd never been to Puerto Rico, and wanted to try local dishes. The staff recommended the Cafe d'Angel (I hope I spelled it right.), which was very close by. It was superb! Try the mifungo. You won't regret it. The hotel also serves a Continental Breakfast which was very good. The Condado Beach is only an easy 2 minute walk. Shopping is nearby, as you are close to a main thoroughfare. We felt comfortable walking in the area, even at night. Everyone we met was friendly and helpful, and no one seemed to mind speaking English. Some reviewers had different opinions on that, and perhaps we were simply more fortunate. I think tho', if you are pleasant to the people there, they will respond the same.As I said, we only stayed overnight, so we can't give a complete description of everything. I do know that if we return to San Juan (which we hope to do), we definitely plan on staying at the Coral Princess again.

<Content>What a wonderful surprise! A must-stay in San Juan! WOW! The Coral Princess Inn was more than we imagined! My husband I stayed at the Coral Princess our first week of our honeymoon and we could not have been more pleased. When we checked in, Janisse greeted us with a smile and informed us that we had been upgraded to the King Suite since it was our honeymoon! (I communicated with the hotel via email before our visit and found everyone to be extremely helpful). Janisse and Glenda were particularly helpful and pleasant during our entire stay!! We expected the rooms to be extremely small, however, found our room to be more than ample. We were in room #24 which is on the second floor in the back area of the hotel. We definitely recommend requesting one of these rooms. The floors are marble throughout the room and bathroom. The bathroom had a shower/tub combo and the tub had jacuzzi jets which was a pleasant surprise as well. The closet/wardrobe has drawers and provides limited space for hanging clothes. The courtyard area was beautiful and the continental breakfast each morning was more than sufficient (croissants, ham, cheese, waffles, oatmeal, juices). The room had a mini fridge stocked with beer, water and wine. The bottles of water were only $1 and the beer was $2 which is much less you would expect for a minibar. One note - they do not have a full size ironing board in your room, so be prepared to use a small tabletop board if you must iron. The location of the hotel is perfect - we ate at 2 great restaurants on Magdalena (hotel's street): Cieto Lindo (Mexican) and Ramiros (fine dining). The beach is about a 3 minute walk straight up from the hotel. Walgreens, as everyone mentioned is right around the corner and open 24 hours. The bus (B21) drops you off almost right in front of the hotel. Note: if you ride the buses make certain to have change as they don't accept bills or credit cards.So, all said and done, we definitely recommend this hotel and if we return to San Juan will stay again at the Coral Princess Inn. Enjoy!Guy  Cynthia Willis, Oklahoma

The continental breakfast offered in the morning is very adequate and the surroundings and decor are very pleasant. The hotel staff are also very pleasant and obliging. The only downside to the hotel is the size of the rooms - even for a boutique hotel they are tiny! There is hardly room for 2 people to move around the room and you certainly wouldn't want to spend any length of time just hanging in the room.

<Content>Beautiful hotel and excellent location at a good price. This hotel is the main reason my wife and I enjoyed our trip to Puerto Rico. It was our first time there, August 4th thru 10th, and probably our last. We chose this hotel because of all the great reviews and its in between all the places we wanted to visit. We visited the caves on the west side and biobay on the east side and the rain forest - which is a must. And Old San Juan too which is just a bunch of shopping except for the two forts.First off, we picked up our rental car and drove towards the hotel. People in Puerto Rico tend to drive fast and change lanes often. Growing up in a big city, I'm used to congestion but changing lanes without signals and very often is a little unnerving. Anyway, we found that we missed our turnoff for the hotel and ended up in Old San Juan. No big deal, the street turns around there due to ocean and takes you right back to Condado and basically straight to the hotel on the one way street. They only have 4 spaces in front of hotel or parking at a lot one block down. We arrived around 1 pm and all the spaces were empty. (We only had to park in the $10 lot one day). Check in was fast and courteous. No problems. Had a room on 2nd floor and perfect size for two people. Nice little refrig. for stowing leftovers and pop purchased at Walgreens right around the corner. Simple breakdown.Hotel was very good price and great location.Only 4 free parking spaces and usually filled up by 5 pm.$10 daily parking one block away if you show ticket to front desk.Walgreens one block away to meet all essentials.Beach two blocks away and very nice with good waves.Good choice of restaurants within walking distance.Recommend Via Appia for italian and Piu Bella for a great selection of sandwiches.Plenty of police around and never felt worried about safety.If you look for change on the ground, you will be happy, we found two dollar bills, about 30 pennies, a nickel, about 5 dimes and a sterling silver ring. Its always good to be aware of your surroundings. Adds to the adventure of life and helps the pocket book. Buses are hit and miss. I'd recommend a taxi for old San Juan or short drive with rental car but make sure you park in free spot. Not well marked and saw alot of tickets. $75 dollar ticket.(Gas was .70 a liter)breakfast included and had meat, bread, pastry, oatmeal, cereal, juice, yogurt and some other things. Perfect filler before heading out on day trips.Pool is small but clean. Hot tub has alot of jets. Plenty of nooks to read books in or chat. Chaise lounges on 3rd floor for sunning.Room was cleaned around 2:30 pm.Front desk always glad to help.If I ever wanted to go back to Puerto Rico, I'd definitely stay here again!!!

<Content>cozy, affordable and close to the best of PR We stayed at this little hotel for three days of our honeymoon after reading reviews on TripAdvisor and I must say, we were not disappointed. Some of the reviews had been mixed, and we had trouble deciding upon an affordable hotel in the San Juan area. We knew we wanted to stay in a boutique hotel, not a huge resort full of families and this fit the bill.The hotel is conveniently located to lots of shops and restaurants and it's just a short trip to Old San Juan where we spent several of our days. The rooms are aiming for a contemporary style and the bathrooms were nicely sized. The one disappointment was that our room was not at all near ready upon our arrival, despite my confirming our arrival time prior to our trip. The attendant at the front desk tried to be accomodating and put our bags in the hotel office while we wandered around. We came back a little while later and our room still was not ready, and the maid was standing around, not cleaning. Finally, the room was ready and the clerk did give us a discounted rate for our trouble.Despite the rocky start, our visit was great. THe small pool in the side yard is charming, but don't expect to be able to swim laps. The rooftop deck was great, though i've heard it's not accessible if someone has rented the penthouse (which is on the same floor). We attempted to soak in the hottub one evening, but the chemicals weren't balanced and it wasn't particularly enticing for that reason.Breakfast was perfect--coffee and croissants. Just a little continental treat.This place was a great bang for the buck, especially if you're like us and spend all of your time out sight-seeing.

<Content>Caution!!! Make Sure You Don't Have to Cancel Your Reservation! Horrible customer service with cancelation of booking! Make sure you are going to stay at this hotel because if not they will not cancel your booking and will charge your credit card for full payment. I travel for business on a regular basis and have never had such an issue with cancelation. I was to stay at the hotel this past February and contacted the hotel via phone to cancel the reservation outside the booking cancelation policy timeline. The hotel representative informed me that I had to cancel via my travel agent. I left my name and requeseted for the hotel manger to contact me back. The hotel never called back. I tried to cancel my reseratation via the online booking agent and was directed back to the hotel to cancel. I contacted the hotel again and spoke to the manager, Louis, and was again directed back to the booking agent. Booking agent said to contact hotel again. Finally out of desparation emailed the hotel to cancel the reservation. The hotel took advantage of all this processing time and let the reservation cancelation time lapse and then charged me for full stay. Make sure you are definately going to commit to visiting this hotel when making a reservation.

<Content>Very Good Value I have stayed here 3 times now and each time I have had a positive experience. My last time was in December 2006. After having just returned from Puerto Rico and stayed at the Villa Del Sol (HORRIBLE) I realized how important it is to write reviews so other travelers know what to expect.I have 2 children (4yr old and 2yr old) and although this is not really a hotel geared for children they have been friendly and helpful. it is meant to be a quiet boutique style hotel so if you have small children you might want to keep this in mind. The common areas are all pretty and intimate. The rooms are tastefully decorated however they are starting to show some wear. A new coat of paint would remedy this. They are on the smaller side by US standards but more than adequate. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Loved It My wife and I stopped off in San Juan on our way through the Carribean this past summer, and choose the Coral Princess because of how highly it was rated. And it lived up to all of the reviews. I had an amazing stay here. I only wish it was longer. The room was very nice, and clean. My wife especially like the jets in the tub. It was very close to the beach, and within walking distances of almost everything. The breakfast was fantastic. I would definetly come back.

<Content>Coral Princess is terrific We booked our stay at the Coral Princess after reading reviews right here...we were not disappointed...the staff were terrific, esp. Janisse and Glinda at the front desk, they were both extremely helpful....the room was terrific, we had a penthouse and it was lovely...great location, convenient to the buses, shopping, restaurants, rental car places, etc...the breakfast was a little disappointing in that there were only fresh bananas two mornings, the other fruit was tinned, but they have croissants, pastries, toast, cereal, yogurt, orange juice, coffee, tea, milk, sliced ham...the bar fridge in the room came in very handy for keeping water cold for our next days ventures...we'd stay there again...

Great continental breakfast in a lovely outdoor setting. 3 blocks from a great beach and 3-4 blocks to great restaurants and shops. I'd return here any time.

<Content>Just Right If your looking for a small intimate hotel nestled in a city neighborhood, versus the high rises on the beach with casinos etc, this is an excellent choice. We spent the last night of our Vieques-Culebra vacation at the Coral Princess in the Condado neighborhood of San Juan. It's two blocks from the beach and shops, and five or ten minutes from the airport. Room with Queen bed was $115 but taxes made it about $142. The hotel was renovated about 6 years ago with Mexican tiles in the courtyard and marble in the bath, colorful art throughout. Nice grotto with palms, pool, and breafast area (included in the room price). Staff was friendly and helpful recommedning an excellent restaurant a couple blocks away Marisqueria Miro where we dined on fabulous Catalonian seafood with wonderful Spanish red wine (Arzuage Crianza 2004) recommended by our lively waiter Marcello. Good bed. Good Value. We really liked it.

<Content>Disappointing Check in desk is in a corridor. We had to move out of the way 3 times to let other guests/staff members in and out of the hotel. After check-in we battled our way through the potted jungle (difficult to pass down the passageway without getting your eye poked by palm fronds) to our room. There was a long black hair in the sink, the bathroom door would not latch shut. Having been told that this was a quiet hotel, we were not pleased to have somebody above our room seemingly moving furniture about and a bunch of people well within hearing distance having conversations until well after 11.30pm. The next day we went out and about, returning to our room after 2.00pm to find that the room had not been serviced. The maid finally came at 3.00pm in the middle of our siesta! The third day when we returned to our room we found that the furniture, and all of our possessions, had been moved around the room and the bedside lights had been changed, one of the old ones being left outside the door. As this was our last day it surely would have made better sense to wait 24 hours until we had checked out? Breakfast buffet was ok but not brilliant. On the 2 occasions we requested a taxi/cab one came promptly.On our last visit to San Juan we stayed at the Comfort Inn a few streets away. This was just as conveniently located and was definitely better value for money. If we return to San Juan in the future we will stay at the Comfort Inn.

<Content>Not as great as everyone says... My husband and I stayed here for four days after a vacation in Vieques. The hotel is okay from the outside and located in a nice, mostly residential neighborhood. It truly is one block from a very pretty beach, and is close to a lot of the restaurants and bars, along with casinos/ATM's/Internet cafes, etc in Condado. It is a $12.00 cab ride to Old San Juan, or there is rumored to be a trolley and buses, but we saw no trolleys (ever) and only a few buses. We found the taxis, though more expensive, to be much more convenient. Their rates are set in the tourist zones of Condado, OSJ, Isla Verde, etc. The rate to the airport is $17.00. Regarding the hotel, we were surprised to see how small everything was. The pictures made it look bigger and from the reviews I read, I didn't recall reading this. Rooms: Our room was the smallest room I had ever stayed in by far. We saw other rooms on the first floor while the maids were cleaning and all were very small. We stayed in Room 6. We paid $153 a night with taxes and other fees. I judged that it was about 11'x12', plus a VERY small bathroom. The jacuzzi tub is a bathtub, only large enough for one person, with a couple of jets. We had one queen bed, a desk, and a minibar in the room. No storage for suitcases, very little room to hang or store clothes. There was one piece of nice art and that is the best thing I can say about the room. The bed was average and the linens were scratchy. By far the worst thing about the room was that it was terribly loud. It is located, along with several other rooms, right off the pool, the breakfast area, and the area where the maids park their cleaning supply cart for the entire morning. If you plan on sleeping past 6:30 in the morning at this hotel, don't stay there, or ask for a quieter room on the second or third floor. The first two mornings we were awakened by plates in the breakfast area, and then by our upstairs 'neighbors' sliding around chairs and walking around in high heels. Very frustrating. Keep in mind this is a small hotel and you are literally paying for a bedroom, not an actual hotel room. The living areas are nice, and they apparently expect you to your time in them or outside the hotel. Service: Housekeeping does a very nice job. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Check-in was easy.Living Areas: There is a lovely patio off of the reception area and some of the rooms. The pool and breakfast area are off the back side of the patio. The pool is extremely small, has four chairs, and is surrounded by barbed walls. It's not overly usable, but will keep you cool. On the third floor there is a nice kitchen w/ frig, microwave, etc that can be used by guest, a pool table, dining table, and an outside patio with a table/chairs and hot tub. Dining/Drinks: There is a minifridge in the room with beer/wine/soda. The prices are very reasonable, although we never used it. The breakfast is from 7:00-10:00 I believe, and is yogurt, fruit, ceral, lunchmeat, croissants, coffee, and orange juice. There are several restaurants around the hotel that are average. Overall our impression of the restaurants in San Juan was not good. We had the worst meal I've ever had anywhere at Mofongos, down along the water at the cruise piers in Old San Juan. We paid $70 for two of the worst meals I've ever seen and my husband was very sick that night after dinner. Excursions: We rented a car from Avis, just down the street, for $55 a day including insurance and drove ourselves out to see the Camuy Caves (note they are not open on Monday or Tuesday). The caves are absolutely amazing and shouldn't be missed! It is $12.00 pp to get in and $3.00 to park. Plan on waiting unless all trolleys are up and running (unlikely). The Marriott offers this same tour for $120 a person, or there are independent companies that charge $60-$70pp. We also saw the Oricebo Observatory and Museum. Definitely worth it also, but might be very difficult for those who are out of shape or handicapped....it's 500+ steps to get up to the museum and overlook. I believe it was $5.00 per person to get into the museum.Overall, the hotel is really just average. If you plan on being up very early and don't mind SMALL spaces, the hotel might be okay for you. If I were to go back, I would choose the Hotel Milano in Old San Juan (it's cheaper and in a better location, not to mention nicer) or one of the hotels on the beach in Condado and pay the difference. I would not stay here again.

<Content>A cool place to stay My huband and I stayed at the Coral Princess for 5 nights, it was a really cute small hotel ,with art all over. The rooms we're small, but we hardly stayed in the rooms because we we're so busy exploring the island. The hotel offred a continental breakfast every morning, which was crossants and juice , the had banana's one day which , we're the best I ever had. The hotel is in avery busy section of the Condado area . Parking is non exsistant, we lucked up a couple of nights to find parking in front of the hotel. The downside of the hotel is the MOSQUITO infestation , We had mosquito's in our room, we woke with bites all over. SO off is a must. Overall we would stay here again

<Content>Better than we expected I booked this hotel through Expedia after reading multiple reviews through Tripadvisor. What caught my eye was Expedia's price AND some excellent information from previous guests.The hotel is a block away from the beach in a safe neighborhood. We were in San Juan on an unusually hot day and the hotel is adequately air-conditioned. Our room was marble floors and I think this contributed to keeping the room at a comfortable temperature and also QUIET. The bathroom was also marble with big, soft, fluffy towels and milled soaps. The staff was extremely helpful and there is a continental breakfast in the morning on the terrace with great coffee. There's a hot tub on the third floor (too hot outside to use that day) and a cute little pool on the first floor. I must say I almost felt like a guest visiting in a friend's home; that's how comfortable our stay was.

<Content>Great little hotel! Stayed here the night before and night after our cruise (May 5 and 13). Nice, clean, no frills hotel. Rooms are comfortable, although not overly large, but with nice flat panel tvs, jacuzzi tubs, lots of nice fluffy towels, etc.Each room also has a wine chiller, stocked with water, soda ($1 each) and space to keep your own drinks cool.Staff was VERY accomodating. Held our luggage after check-out while we played tourist in Old San Juan, and also on our return after the cruise. Arrived before 9am after cruise, and they not only held the luggage, but offered breakfast, bottled water, and allowed us to sit by the pool.Staff is very friendly and helpful, will call you a cab, recommend places to eat, etc. Area has lots of restaurants, plus 24 hour Walgreens around the corner. About 2 blocks away is an internet cafe, which i used to check in for my flight and print boarding pass. The beach is about 3 blocks, and the bus to OSJ (.75 each way) picks you up around the corner, and the return stop is across the street.prices were lower than some of the big resorts closer to the pier, and i believe it was about $16 to the pier by taxi, well worth it, in my opinion.Didn't use the pool or hot tub, but they are clean and well kept...

<Content>Clean, Quiet, Comfortable We stayed at the Coral Princess Inn the night before our cruise. The hotel is small and clean. It's a no frills hotel with decent beds and the rooms are VERY quiet. It's a short walk to the beach. The staff was friendly and helpful. It's very near the cruise dock, so near that I timed our trip to the ship. From the time we left the hotel to the time we were in our cabin was exactly 30 minutes. 10 to 15 minutes maximum in the taxi and about the same to get checked in with RCCL. You could spend more at nearby hotels if you need something more. For us this hotel was perfect.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised After doing weeks and weeks of seaching for a hotel in San Juan, my girlfriend and I picked the Coral Princess Inn.Hotel: We stayed on the first floor. The hotel is very clean, and has a great atmosphere. We had a Queen sized bed in our room, and found that there was ample space for our 2 suitcases. You get a small wardrobe which was very handy. There's also a small fridge. The bathroom isn't large, but nor is it cramped. Breakfast was great, and we had many items to pick from. It was cheaper for us to book directly through the hotel.Staff: Very friendly and helpful. Customer service was excellent. Can't ask for much more.Location: About 2 blocks from the beach, and there are many great restaurants nearby. They aren't cheap, but perfect for a nice dinner. There is also a nearby Walgreens which was very convenient. We only took walks on the beach at night, so I have no idea how nice Condado beach is. The hotel property is also easily accessible from the highway. Watch out for rush-hour San Juan traffic. Here's a hint: Go to east (Fajardo, etc) during the weekday. Save going west for weekends. We found that to work very well for us.Parking: We had a rental car all 4 days of our trip. There are 3 spots infront of the hotel, and only 1 night we were lucky enough to get it. Otherwise, we parked at a nearby parking lot down the street for $10 a day. It's steep, but expected.Overall: It's great that this hotel isn't a large hotel with bustling with tourists. We loved how at home you feel once you've setteled in. Very unique, and I would definitely be a return visitor.

<Content>OK I read pretty much all the reviews for hotels in PR, plus Vieques and decided to stay in Coral Princess, I was there mid april and I didn't find the hotel to be as great as all the reviews I'd read. It's a nice simple hotel if you're on a budget, in an excellent location.Restaurants and supermarkets are within walking distance. Great for someone who doesn't have a car. Breakfast wasn't fantastic. Some of the staff were really friendly but not all. The air con like most hotels in the Condado area only have an off and on setting and cos this hotel was swarming with mosquitos at the time I went, you have two options, to freeze or get bitten so I chose to freeze! If your looking for a good price, basic accommodation and a great location, this is the place for you

<Content>Affordable luxury My travel agent recommended this place. We needed a place to stay one night after finishing a 7 night cruise. Definitely a gem. Somehow we were given the Penthouse 1. Fantastic room! Spacious, tiled in marble, walk in closet, double sinks, separate toilet and bidet area, and separate jacuzzi tub area. Doors open to a balcony, which leads to the outdoor hot tub. Wine cooler in room stocked with beer and wine at an additional charge. Weight bench and flat screen TV. Having never been to San Juan or Condado, I was surprised of the area in general. Lots of bars on windows of surrounding buildings. Some buildings completely run down. If you are used to city living, this may not bother you. But if you have to stay in San Juan, don't miss this place. Much more charm than a general chain hotel.

<Content>Terrific inn, newly renovated and charming! We stayed at this hotel for one night as we returned to San Juan from a cruise and it was excellent. Our room and bathroom were large and the common areas beautifully decorated. Floors throughout are tile and there are many art pieces on the walls and in specially designed niches. On the main floor is a garden and patio area which is simply breathtaking, with orchids and other tropical plants. Once away from the front desk, you would hardly know you were still in the middle of a large city. There is also a small pool which has been built into a secluded area; a small elevator; and in the back of the main floor, a piano, a breakfast bar, and a microwave. Our room had a refrigerator and internet access.Personally, I would probably not choose this inn if I was traveling with children, mainly because the atmosphere seems better suited to couples or solo travelers. Some areas would also be difficult to navigate with a stroller or extra luggage. The Old Town is a short drive or taxi ride away, and there are a number of good restaurants within walking distance. There is a US post office and a drugstore with grocery items about a block away. The staff was exceptionally accommodating and followed up with us immediately on an item we had left behind. We would definitely recommend this inn to anyone looking for an oasis in the middle of San Juan...it was the perfect end to our vacation.S. Rey-Barreau

<Content>Wonderful and interesting hotel! STAY HERE! What a find! Although the hotel is not in the old town, it is still in the nice area of Condodo. Whilst this is a touristy area, don't let that put you off - it is a nice, safe and relaxing area. The hotel has a very nice feel to it, with nice rooms, a number of nice patio areas and a small pool. It does not have a bar or anywhere to eat but do not let that put you off as you there are plenty around. It has a BB feel to it whilst having everything you need to relax and enjoy your stay. The staff are first class (they organised me a great trip to the rain forest) and the rooms are have everything you need. I was traveling alone yet they made me feel most welcome on my trip. Well done the Coral Princess Hotel!

While the Coral Princess Inn is not located on the beach it is clean and has a pool and jacuzzi. Staff was friendly and helpful. Our room even had a jacuzzi tub. Compared to other places in Puerto Rico this hotel offered great value. Other places are really overpriced...

<Content>A very pleasant stay We stayed at this hotel after spending a few nights at the dismal pit known as the Iberia Hotel. What a wonderful relief it was to move here! For only about $50 more the experience was a huge step up. The Coral was modern and well appointed. Lots of attractive plants and everything seemed airy and open. The room had a nice king bed, a fridge, a flat screen TV and a jetted tub. The breakfast was served buffet style outside and was an unexpected treat as we didn't know that was included. We had stayed at the Caribe Hilton in SJ a few weeks before and for more than double the price had no breakfast, so this breakfast was a nice addition and had a big selection. The pool is small but nice to jump into when you get hot walking the streets shopping. The staff was attentive to questions but not chatty. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Friendly and Convienent My travel agent recommended this little gem. Located in a suburb 10 minutes for Old San Juan close to the beach and numerous great resturants the Coral Princess was a sharp contrast to the large resort we had stayed in on the first part of our vacation. We had a large, clean room with a well stocked mini bar ($2 for a tin of the local brew) that was only three minutes walk to some great local eateries that the front desk staff directed us to. Taxi to Old San Juan is about $14 and the bus is .75

<Content>Almost perfect For our first trip to San Juan, going by the mostly positive reviews here, I found the Coral Princess Inn to be almost perfect. We stayed in room 15 which was fairly large, clean and adequate. Marble floors and bathroom, mini fridge, a/c and ceiling fan, flat panel tv's. The upstairs open lounge area was very nice, although we didn't get a chance to use it. The pool, which we did use, was small, but very nice. They stored our luggage until our room was ready. The included breakfast was nice.The day time desk person was knowledgeable about the area, but the evening person was not so much. The beach was only two blocks away. Taxi to the airport seemed to cost about $15 + bag fees. Taxi to Old San Juan is $12. I can highly recommend Via Appia on Ashford Ave, it is a Italian and pizza neighborhood joint filled with locals and the food and service are excellent. Walgreens was close by and very handy.I only have two complaints. The hotel is in the Condado area. There is not a whole lot in the Condado area aside from a three-four block stretch of restaurants and stores on Ashford Ave. If you wandered even a block or two outside of the touristy area, it got really seedy and there were a lot of homeless beggars around. The other complaint is that the water pressure in the shower was non-existent, a very weak spray and the water kept changing temperature throughout the shower, so you were either freezing or scalded repeatedly. Aside from these two problems, the Coral Princess Inn would have been perfect.

<Content>Five star Well what a wonderful little hotel. The room was clean and quiet,and the staff was very helpfull. We stayed here two days before our cruise. The cruise did not leave until well after our check out and they have a place where you can safely put your bags.I will stay here next time I am in San Juan. I booked here because of the reviews I read here and there all right. FIVE STAR *****

<Content>A Great Boutique Hotel Before booking our hotel in San Juan, I read many reviews of the Coral Princess Inn in TripAdvisor.com. Of the several dozen I read, around 95% were very positive and the rest were mostly good. I am glad to report that our experience was also very positive.First the pros: The Coral Princess Inn is very pretty and well maintained. The hotel is small (boutique), but is decorated with many tropical plants (especially on the outside areas) and has several nooks for reading or other semi-private conversations. The appointments are very nice dark wood, reminicent of an English style The pool area is quite attractive as well. My wife loved the morning coffee and continental breakfast area where people would gather each morning. Plus, the dishes were china, not plastic - a very nice touch!Our room was small, but again, nicely appointed and very, very clean. And the tub was a jacuzzi tub, which was unexpected.The hotel is in the Condado area, in sort of a neighborhood area, a bit off the beaten path but only a few blocks from the beach and touristy stuff. We very much appreciated that part. Several restaurants were within a block or so of the hotel as was a Walgreen's (which also had a grocery section!) which was certainly helpful. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and our airconditioner stopped cooling on the 3rd night (not a big deal considering how mild the temps were). I reported the problem that morning as we were leaving for an excursion and the staff had it repaired in a matter of a few hours - very impressive!The only thing I can think of for improvement is that printed bus schedules/routes be made available for the guests. For some reason, you can't find these anywhere at hotels, Not sure what the story is with that.To be honest, we were not that impressed with San Juan as a destination. The beaches were blah (no one even bothered to have the seaweed cleaned off the beaches), the concept of beach bars seemed to be almost completely lost on the local tourist industry and the food and drink quality was fairly low, yet prices were rather high. I doubt we will go back to San Juan, but we might try other areas of Puerto Rico.Of course, the above negatives have virutally nothing to do with the Coral Princess Inn. They were absolutely the highllight of our trip and my wife and I would highly recommend them to anyone traveling to San Juan.

<Content>Good deal We stayed at the hotel for two nights after a cruise. We arrived at the hotel about 11:00 am, and our room was not ready. They allowed us to put our luggage in a room so we could go walk about until our room was ready. We went to eat at a place right around the corner. Stopped in at Walgreens for some tanning lotion, and then we headed back to the hotel about 1:00 pm. They got us into our room. The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. They have a frig in the room that has soda, water, beer, and wine for very affordable prices. $2 for beer and $1 for water. You could also place items in there that you brought yourself. We got changed and hit the beach 2 blocks away. Clean and spacious beach. Rented two chairs. We took a bio-luminescense bay tour that night. The breakfasts in the morning were sufficient and just like many others have commented on. The second day we went on an El Yunque tour and then tanned on the top floor of the hotel where the hot tub is located. Very relaxing. The pool is very small and hard to get any sun. We went to the Marriott for drinks that evening and dinner at the Japanese restaurant next door to the Marriott. Certainly not an upscale hotel (we actually got picked up for one of our tours at the Ritz-Carlton...NICE), but it was clean, pretty and affordable. If you aren't looking for a resort, this hotel is right for anyone.

<Content>stay...stay...stay, without a doubt We took the red eye and got to the hotel at 10:30 am. Our room was not ready, however we were able to store our luggage, change, and doze/read out by the pool. They came to get us when the room was ready. It was lovely. The bed was very comfortable. We even had a jetted tub. The hot/cold water was sensitive, but we never ran out of either. The front desk area is small, but not a problem. They arranged for us to go sailing, recommended restaraunts with good Puerto Rican food, and booked massages for us. The grounds are very lush, there are even orchids gowing on the plants. It is within walking distance for everything good in Condando. We stayed a few days before a cruise and liked it so much that we are thinking of booking another visit for our whole family. We stayed our last night of the trip at a big hotel in Old San Juan. I wish we stayed at the Coral Princess...it's a gem.

<Content>Cute and cozy, but small. Do not expect luxury. We spent four nights at the Coral Princess. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was very small. The bed not particularly comfortable. The sheets were anything but crisp. The pillows were small and flat. The best part of the Inn is outside the room. The environs are warm and cozy, and secluded. There seemed to be few people about, but the Inn was full. Breakfast was totally lame. We will only return to the Coral Princess if we are going with a group of friends or family. The third floor has a nice, roomy area with a large dinner table, sofas, and a full kitchen that would be great for evening get togethers with friends to swap stories from the day of site seeing and beach going. The nearby beach was clean and provided us plenty of room even during this spring break week.I highly recommend the area and the beach, but will choose a more full featured hotel on our next trip.

<Content>what a little princess! We stayed for one night at the coral princess inn and wished we had stayed longer. The property itself is a a hidden jewel in the jaded district of condado.We had a double room on the front of the property |(yes it gets a little noisy but who stays in their rooms that long anyway??) which had a flat screen tv, two large windows and a full bathroom with jacuzzi tub...a real treat after a nights dancing. Lovely rooms full of characterWe tried the pool on arriving but the sun had gone in over this part of the hotel...I would suggest going straight to the 3rd floor and sit in the hot tub watching the world go by in condado. Breakfast, although some may say it was a little basic was more than adequate for us, fresh orange, serve yourself toast cereal, coffee and pastries...just what you needed to set you up forthe day. It was all fresh and there was plenty to eat if you were really hungryI have to say I thougt this hotel was, in comparison to some of the larger, brasher hotels in condado, a lovely place which does the owners proud. From the rooms to the beautful terraces and gardens throughout it cannot fail to please (and if it does stick to the souless larger hotels on Ashford Avenue)I would have no hesitation in staying there again, its a lovely hotel with a location that is in the middle of everything you need to see in Condado.

<Content>nice property-great location My 13 year old daughter and I recently spent 2 nights at the Inn pre-cruise. We found the previous reviews to be accurate. The Inn is similar to staying in a villa witha private pool, multiple sitting areas, a reading room, rooftop terrace etc. The location is excellent- close to restaurants ( angel cafe for puerto rican food, Danne's for Italian), the beach ( about a block and one half), salons (pedicure/manicure), and multiple shopping venues. There is a great little gelato place right around the corner that is good for a light lunch. My daughter basically had the pool all to herself which was great after a day of sightseeing . The breakfast was more than adequate with croissants, cold cereal, yogurt, ham, cheese, pastries, juices, and wonderful coffee. The room itself was a bit small ( we had 2 double beds, a whirlpool tub, flat screen TV, microwave, and small fridge, but was certainly adequate to our needs. The mattresses on the beds were a bit uncomfortable and should probably be replaced. Other than that we found our stay at the Inn to be pleasant and would recommend it without hesitation.

<Content>Nice Place to Stay Very well located Inn. Their attitude is refreshing and very accomodating (willing to please), especially Janisse Roldes at reception desk. We stayed for 2 nights - March 6  7 of 2007 and they were very willing to help us in any way they could. Which was so refreshing after staying in Fajardo. We enjoyed our stay while we toured Old San Juan. The only suggestion is that they add peanut butter to the continental breakfast - you need the protein for walking in Old San Juan! Very clean accomodation and good location - we would stay here again - felt safe and welcome.Mary - Ontario, Canada

<Content>Great family stay! We recently returned from our stay at the Coral Princess, and what a wonderful time we had at this property. We arrived late on a Monday night and found our very clean room still waiting for us. Breakfast each morning was more than sufficient; great coffee, too. The staff was extremely helpful with all of our requests. My children(9 and 5 years old) were perfectly content with the pool on the days we did not go to the beach. They also loved the roof top jacuzzi and pool table. For the week we where there, my wife commented that the inn felt like our own private condo. The restaurants nearby (cielito lindo and via appia; where our favorites) were all fine for a young family. Overall, we loved the Coral Princess and can't wait to return in the near future.

<Content>Cute - but........... After reading reviews through trip advisor we booked a three night pre-cruise stay at the Coral Princess Inn. The hotel is very cute and very, very clean with lots of nice areas around the hotel for sitting and relaxing. The breakfast area was very nice. I will say though that we had the smallest hotel room (#8) we have ever stayed in. There was a double bed with barely enough room to walk around it - in fact, we both banged our shins on the corners of the bed several times. There was no closet, only a small armoire with 2 hangers. We did not unpack our suitcases - there was no room. We thought we better get used to it as we were going to an inside cabin on the ship - but believe me, that was way bigger! On the last day, we were able to store our bags in a locked room for the afternoon with a bunch of other luggage (very convenient).All in all, it is a cute hotel...........fine to stay in for a night or two, but I sure wouldn't plan a weeks holiday there - at least not in that room. The $120 US night charge, with taxes, ended up costing $181.71 per night Cdn. - reasonable I guess for Puerto Rico, but................

<Content>Great Little Inn in the heart of Condado Recently stayed there with my mom (2/8-2/13) and knew we would have a great time based on all of the reviews I had read. I was pleasantly surprised at how quaint this inn is. Our room was on the second floor towards the back (#21) and it was so nice and quiet and peaceful. Felt like home. In the morning my mom would drink her coffee outside in the little outdoor sitting area. At night after dinner we would sit upstairs on the third floor to wind down.Breakfast in the morning was nice. Never found it crowded as others have mentioned. And if they did find it crowded, there's always space upstairs on the 2nd floor where you can sit and eat and read the paper if you like.Pool area was small but then again, if you wanted a hotel with a big pool then you should stay somewhere else like the Marriott. You get what you pay for. This inn is nicely priced without all of the big hotel craziness and that's what we liked about it.The beach is only 2 blocks away (watch out though, the surf is a bit rough) and you can rent chairs for $3. While there the beach was not crowded and the weather was fantastic, sunny and in the 80s. There was always a police presence either at the beach or around town so we always felt safe.Walgreens is a block away and as others have mentioned so is the bus stop to head into San Juan. The schedule is a little sketchy (we waited 20 min to go to San Juan and 30 min to head back to Condado in the afternoon). There are tons of restaurants on Ashford Av and nice little shops. Mom already wants to go back she loved it so much. Definitely recommend this inn if you are looking for something quiet and close to everything.

<Content>King and Queen at the Coral Princess Quaint, charming, and in a great location. After a hot (and fun) day of walking around Old San Juan, we went back to the Coral Princess and got in the rooftop hot tub. We had it all to ourselves and those foot massage jets in the bottom of the hot tub were the perfect remedy to our sore feet. Afterwards, we played a game of pool in the upstairs suite, which is open to all guests. I wish we'd had stayed longer than two nights.

<Content>Nice and comfortable We decided to stay here after reading the reviews of another hotel we had already booked for the two night stay after our cruise. The reviews of the other hotel were so bad and this one so good for just a few dollars more that we weren't sure what we would find. We were very pleasantly suprised to find it just as described in the reviews and in their webwsite. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The common area upstairs is just great if you have friends stop over to say hi or just to relax with a good book. The front desk clerks are extremely helpful and always pleasant. For all the amenities available here at such a great price, I would not hesitate to book it again. The only drawback was the hot and cold water flucuates back and forth when taking a shower but being only two blocks from the beach and resaurants certainly makes up for the minor inconvienence.

<Content>Tropical surroundings in a quaint hotel We recently stayed at the Coral Princess Inn (Feb. 16-19). It was a cozy inn with a carribbean feel. I loved the tiled walkways with all of the tropical plants surrounding us. The pool and jacuzzi were small, but refreshing. Our room had a comfortable bed, and was just the right size for two people.The complimentary breakfast included fruit, yogurt and pastries and the friendly staff was very knowledgable about the area. Condado beach was only 2 blocks away and the bus stop to Old San Juan was just across the street (you can ride the bus to the city for 75 cents exact change). It was a nice place to stay.

<Content>Decent Place We just returned from a four night stay at the Coral Princess ( Feb 10-14th). As many others have stated, it is a great little boutique hotel in a convenient area. We liked the hotel and were glad that we stayed there. All of the staff were excellent and very helpful. The weather was sunny and in the 80鈥檚 every day. Having read all the reviews, there were a few things that we didn鈥檛 expect. The rooms are small and have no closets, only a half sized armoire. There are no security safes in the room, you have to rent them. There were none available our whole stay. The pool only has space for about three sun recliners. When the hotel is at capacity the breakfast area can get very crowded and seating is a problem. All in all it is a nice little property within walking distance to three beaches: Condado (great for kids), Ocean Park (long stretch of sand with warm water but rough surf) and the beach around the corner that has chairs for rent. It is also central to all the night life. The area seemed very safe to us.

<Content>just right! Coral Princess Inn was the perfect little hotel for us. It was in a great location, about 3 blocks from the beach, 2 blocks from walgreens, 2 blocks from the bus to old san juan, and surrounded by lots of restaurants and shops. There are also other larger hotels, such as the mariott, nearby if you want to take advantages of things such as spa services or casinos. We stayed at the Coral Princess Inn for 5 nights, and the price was incredibly reasonable for what we received. The room was small, but was clean and the bathroom and floor were marble, which was nice. We had cable and high-speed internet access. There are many places to sit, and a nice walkway with lots of plants. The hotel has a small pool and hot tub which we didn't use, and breakfast every morning from 7-9 which i never woke up early enough to use, but my friend said the breakfast was 'okay'. This is not a luxury hotel, so don't expect lots of amenities. But you can expect all of the basics a hotel should have.overall, i'd definitely stay here again because of the location, cleanliness, friendly staff and mostly because of the price.

<Content>Beautiful Little Inn We stayed at the Coral Princess Inn last weekend, after reading several reviews on this site. The location is great, extremely central in the Condado area, just 1,5 block away from the Marriott Hotel, and two blocks from the beach. Walgreens is right around the corner, for any little groceries. Being a manager in a 4-Star Renaissance hotel in the Caribbean, I can say that I know where I'm talking about: The hotel has a small reception, with staff that is helpful, and are willing to do an extra step for you. The 25 rooms are among 3 floors, of which the topfloor is the nicest, with the biggest rooms(suites), some sort of living room(nicely maintained), a pooltable, and a outside area with loungchairs and a jacuzzi. On the ground floor, where our room was located, the place is full of plants, (maybe even too full), which gives a very comfortable cozy atmosphere. Breakfast happens there, on nicely maintained furniture.The room we were in was Nr.10, which is actually a room for disabled, so we had no jacuzzi but a shower, which worked out OK. The hotel was full, so there was no choice as to stay in that room. The rooms have a fridge, microwave, a TV, a good airco-unit, but no cutlery in the drawers under the microwave... The fridge was filled with some beverages , which were very cheap ($1,- for Soda, $2,- for beer). The turndown service was up to 4/5 star standard, with daily refreshment of towels, etc... Moreover, which is in my opinion the most important, the place was clean and well maintained, both inside as outside the rooms!The breakfast, which is included, consists daily(!) of: OJ, Coffee, Milk, Flakes, Croissants, 3 kinds of pastries, ham/cheese, yoghurts, marmelade, bananas. Good enough to start your day with. But for a week stay it would be a little boring.The one little difficulty is parking, with only four spots in front of the hotel. My Puerto Rican friend had to park her car everytime on parking lot Magdalena, which is one block away, and is $10,65 for 24 hours. That's the best deal you can get closeby, or you might wanna choose to go and find yourself a spot in the nearby streets.If you are used to big hotels and robotic service, go to those places, and pay double of what you pay here; a nice, cozy and clean(!) place, on a great location and TOP value for money. Have fun!!

<Content>Good value/location Perfect location, quiet, but close to the beach, shopping, restaurants, casinos, and it felt very safe on the streets at night. It's been mentioned before, but the 24-hour walgreens a block away was great!The staff were friendly, not super-awesome, but nice enough. The rooms were good, but since it's a low-rise, you're not likely to get a view or natural light in your room.Continental breakfast was superb, mostly due to the beautiful terraced patio in the hotel courtyard.Definately reccomend as a nice, clean, safe, budget accomodation in San Juan!

<Content>Loved this hotel! We just got back from a long weekend at this hotel and we loved it. We loved the hot tub on the roof and spent almost every night up there for sunset. The staff was superb. They helped us with directions, restaurant recommendations, and set up a tour of El Yunque for us. My boyfriend especially appreciated Jose's help. The room was really nice and clean and was a bit small but we spent very little time in it. Yes, the water temperature does fluctuate a bit, but honestly, it's not a big deal. Our room had a fridge where you could purchase cheap bottles of water and soda. My boyfriend thought there was a bit too much hallway noise, but compared to other hotels I've stayed at I think it was pretty minimal. There was a continental breakfast which was completely purchased things from Costco, but it was adequate. And they served it until 10:00 which was nice. Finally, the pool is small, but was very cute and nice. It is shaded in the afternoon, which was nice for me with my fair skin. There were plenty of nice outdoor spaces to relax, a reading room, a pool table, a kitchen, and laundry facilities.

<Content>Little Princess Fun modern boutique property with many common areas. Hotel is about five years old. Short on info in room but the staff is very helpful. Great artwork and attention to landscape and design. Pool is tiny but usable. Fairly quiet in the rooms given that its all hard surfaces - stone, tile, etc. Recommend for adults. Taxi to airport $14; to Old San Juan $12. A $120 room is $150 with taxes. Would stay again.

<Content>nice place, helpful staff, great location I would agree with the generally positive reviews of the Coral Princess. It is a nice, small property in a great location. They are a few blocks from many restaurants, 2 blocks from the beach and 1 block from Wallgreens (in case you forgot anything!)The rooms were ok. nothing special, but about what you would expect for this price and they were clean. The best parts of the place were the location and the very friendly and helpful staff who work there.Breakfast is very simple, but fine and in a nice setting. there is a great deal of common and outdoor space for a hotel of this size. in fact, the number of nice sitting areas almost seems excessive if that is possible. There is a hot tub on the roof which is very nice, but when we went to use it, it was cold! The staff said they couldn't do much to fix it, so we didn't try it again.One other strange complaint is that the lobby was always cold. The lobby is very small and is just basically the check in desk and the elevator, so you don't spend much time there, but I felt bad for the staff who had to work there, they all seemed to bring sweaters and sweatshirts. I would definitely stay here again when visiting PR. The place had some minor issues, but it was clean, charming, helpful staff and in a great location at a great price compared to other options around.

<Content>Perfect combo - Hip hotel without the attitude This is a BEAUTIFUL hotel without any of the too cool attitude you might expect from a property with original artwork all over. The staff is friendly but not overbearing, the rooms are very clean, bright, and provide enough space for two people and their luggage spread all over. The courtyard garden is truly exquisite - really a pleasure to walk through and sit in. Coral Princess Inn is a great hotel that is very affordable. There are a few parking spots in front, which is nice because the street parking is limited.Breakfast is everything you need it to be: coffee, juice, pastries, croissants, ham, cheese, bread, cereal, fruit. There is a toaster as well as microwave. The hotel also provide a unique 3rd floor suite that everyone can use. We enjoyed the jacuzzi as well as the pool table. The hotel also has a cute pool. All this in a EXTREMELY well-priced, boutique style hotel.It is literally 1 block to Condado beach which has really soft sand and big waves. Great for body surfing or boogey boarding, You are also around the corner from Ashford Avenue, which is the main drag in Condado. I would recommend taking a taxi (about $13) to Old San Juan for the day and walking around. It is really enjoyable to see the old architecture and forts, and there are fantastic shops there. I really recommend this hotel because it is between Old San Juan and the airport, yet has excellent beaches and won't break the bank while still providing continental breakfast. I will be staying here again, definitely, and so should you!

<Content>Thanksgiving Stay We arrived at the Coral Princess Inn for a one night stay on Thankgiving evening. While the room was small, it was comfortable, and apart from a touchy hot/cold shower head (which we informed the staff of, who dealt with it asap) we enjoyed our short stay. The breakfast was great, we were right around the corner from Ashford (the main drag) and one block further was the beach. After arriving around 4 pm, we were in the water dodging the big waves at 4:30 pm. A great place to stay for a short visit.

<Content>Wow, what a deal!!! We stayed for 2 nights. We booked it after reading reviews here, and going to the website. We were really impressed. What a great deal. For the cost it is an absolutely beautiful little hotel in the Condado district where all the great restaurants are. It is a block from the beach, and has lots of convenient stores/businesses nearby. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Honestly, when you walk around the place, for the money it's really nice. Outdoor plant-lined walkways lead to rooms. Once inside, it is lined with marble floors and once upstairs, it is like a penthouse suite. There is a pool table and full kitchen area that looks like an expensive condo. There is a pool on the second floor, and there is a jacuzzi on the roof overlooking the city. The guy at the desk told us this was supposed to be a luxury condo at one point, but the owner decided to make it a hotel. This is why the inside looks like an upscale condo. Our room was large, with huge closets, a sitting area, and a really large marble covered bathroom. All in all this place was a surprising gem and a total amazing deal for the money.

<Content>Helpful staff, good location We booked this hotel for a weekend stay in San Juan. It is located on Calle Magdalena, which runs parallel to the main avenue, Calle Ashford. It's therefore close to all of the restaurants, bars, clubs, etc., but still quiet.There are about four to six parking spots available in front of the hotel, depending on how well the cars are squeezed together. There is street parking on side streets if you are up for looking, but you'll do yourself a favor by having a compact car. Parking rules in the area are marked, though sparingly, and since many people park illegally, you can't pick spots based on where others have parked.The hotel entrance is controlled by an electronic latch, so you must buzz in to enter. The front desk is staffed 24 hours, giving additional security. The staff was incredibly helpful and spoke both English and Spanish fluently.Hotel rooms are arranged around a small courtyard. We stayed in a Corporate Executive Queen. There was also a night table, dresser, TV, armoire, small fridge, microwave, and kitchenette sink. The bathroom also had a bath tub with jets. There was an internet router with a wired connection available, though we did not use it. The air conditioner and fan were powerful enough to get it cold (actually chilly).The continental breakfast was great, with yogurt, cinnamon and apple loaves, hamm, cheese, croissants, tea, and of course coffee. There is also a small in-ground pool on the property, though it could get crowded fairly quickly. The in-room fridge is stocked with water and soda for $1 each and beer for $2 each, which is only slightly more expensive than the same items at the Walgreen's right around the corner, but much cheaper than buying from vendors on the beach.The hotel is located in the Condado/Santurce area of San Juan, close to many restaurants and amenities. The beach is also only five minutes by foot, though we walked east a bit to find a less rocky portion.As another reviewer mentioned, the taxes add quite a bit to the published rate, but this is a result of local laws, not the hotel or the booking agency. On the whole, we had a good time at the hotel, and it served as a relaxing place to come back to every night. Our only complaint was that checkout time was at 11 a.m. instead of the usual noon.

<Content>Good Deal, Great Service, Nice Stay We just returned from a five night stay at the Coral Princess and we enjoyed our stay. This is the perfect stop for the budget traveler. One thing to keep in mind when traveling in Puerto Rico tourist taxes add up. We didn't find out until we arrived at the hotel. The Expedia price said $99.00/night but with taxes it averaged out $140/ night. This is no fault of the hotel. We booked a room with a double bed for the two of us. It's small but we didn't plan on staying in the hotel much. There is free internet via ethernet cable. Apparently there is wireless but it was not working during our stay. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. There is a ceiling fan and a remote to the air conditioning unit. (The only reason I mention this is because it took some time to figure it out.) The only complaint about the room is the showerhead. It wasn't very strong but it's a very minor detail. As mentioned before on this site there are not many amenities but that did not bother us. The free breakfast was nice. There were fresh bananas, cereal, pastries, yogurt, and croissants. The front desk is very helpful. F.Y.I- If you plan on taking a bus to Old San Juan you need to take B21 and it does not seem to have a schedule. We waited 45 mins one day. The good thing is that it only costs 75 cents one way to Old San Juan. Otherwise expect to pay $12.00+ for cab fare. The beach is a block and a half away. There is plenty to eat in the surround neighborhood particularly on Ashford Ave.

<Content>Unexpected cancellation penalty Coral Princess Hotel is a charming hotel with good location and a friendly, conscientious staff.BUT HEADS UP-if you do not cancel nine days prior to arrival you will be charged for the entire stay not a one night deposit. If you wish to leave early you will be charged for the entire stay. Also I booked a rate of $115 daily and later learned it did not include a combined daily charge of $8.72 (internet/continental breakfast/cable TV/etc.

<Content>Great Hotel I looked at various hotels on tripadvisor and decided to stay at the Coral Princess Inn, and am glad I did. I could not beat the price, location and service of this hotel. The hotel is about 2 blocks from Condado Beach, a block from a casino and within blocks of a few bars/clubs that I would frequent (alternative lifestyle). The room was very small, but was right off of a great little second floor patio that I could smoke and relax at. I had asked for an iron and ironing board and it was delivered in less than a minute.You have to be very careful what hotel you book in Condado, it is a great area, but has some questionable hotels. Stay at this one for a clean and convenient hotel.

<Content>Quaint Little Inn I always check on tripadvisor before I stay anywhere. This was a cute small inn that is perfect if you just want a room. If you want entertainment and large swimming pools then the Marriott would be a better choice. They offer a free breakfast bar every morning in a quaint  beautiful courtyard. Luis was extremly helpful several time to us. The walk to the beautiful beach was only 11/2 blocks away.

The pool area was small but sufficient and they had a nice sun deck. The hotel is centrally located to everything, casino's, beaches, stores, restaurant, clubs. We would definitely stay there again on our next visit to PR.

<Content>OK but HEI is a little better My wife  I stayed at the Coral Princess for 2 nights in June 2006 prior to our cruise. I was a little disappointed with the place. We stayed at Holiday Inn Express last year and really enjoyed it. The people at the Coral Princess were very nice and helpful. The room was clean. The breakfast left alot to be desired. The hottub was broke. The pool was small but nice. The price was not bad. Overall I would stay again if HEI was not available.

<Content>Excellent location, friendly staff and great price Location: The hotel is located at Condado, which seems to me is going through some kind of transformation, there are some pretty run down building and new constraction at the area. During the day time, there isn't much going on. But at night it is hopping with great resturant and night lifes. We ate at some fabulas resturants that is just blocks from the hotel which is great because you cannot always find parking, if you do, you want to stay there. The hotel has arrangement with a local parking garage that is one block off for 10 per day. It is close and we don't mind the walk. The hotel only has two free parking athte front and it is almost always taken. We did walk to check out the beach that is two blocks off. With all the beaches in PR I have to give this a C+, it is kind of dirty and the surf is high. Other people has comment on the Walgreen. It is really one of the big selling point of this hotel for me. I am assuming people who read this are budget conscious and what is more budget conscious then purchasing your daily need in a chain store. I have to say we went to that store almost everyday we stay here. We purchase items such as sun block, lotion, disposible camera and etc. The price is a bit higher but not much more. There is also an internet cafe nearby for those of us who has to always stay connected but didn't want to carry the laptop. It is on Av. Ashe.Room: The hotel is create with the feeling of a boutique hotel. The furniture and design are very sleek and stylish(dark wood furniture with black and white marble tiles). However the hotel is really tiny and so are the room. My biggest complain is that there is no place to charge my laptop. The hotel has free internet connect but all the outlet has been taken (two for the lights at both end tables, one for the phone, one for the clock). So we had to live without the clock since that is the only one we can give up. Because the floor is marble tiled, there is a pretty significant crack at the bottom where the door and the tile floor touches (or doesn't touch), and we get bugs coming into the room all the time. We solve the problem by putting a towel over it. We do like the mini freg very much, we put our bottle water in it the night before so we can bring cold water with us.Amenity: The hotel has reading room, a kitchen, a piano, a tiled backyard with sitting area, 2nd floor sitting area and the third floor is like a club house with hot tub. It is really neat and we enjoy the breakfast. It has milk, orange juice, three or four different type of pastry, ham and cheese, bread and coffee (unfortunately they ran out of tea after the first day and never replace it. PR is not a big tea drinking country, not hot tea anyway). The pool is on the first floor hiding on the side of the building. It is tiny but during the two times we used the pool we are always the only one in it. It gave you the feeling that it is your own private pool so that is very nice.Service: People at Coral Princess Inn has provided excellent service. They listen to all our questions and did their best to help us. They do a great job clean the room everyday. When I had connection trouble they connected me with a helpdesk person right away and actually solved the problem in very little time.Misc: When we pick up our car in the Alamo, we were given a tourist map. The map actually mislabeled the hotel so you should try to print out your own direction instead of relying on the tourist map.

<Content>Clean and economical choice in Condado area Lovely public areas. Good complimentary breakfast in the garden. Service was excellent - all the people at the desk were polite and friendly. Rooms were OK, more plain than the public areas, but with great air conditioning and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub. Everything was clean. Bed linens weren't luxe but certainly sufficient. Hotel is a 15 dollar cab ride from airport, and a 2 minute walk from the Marriott, where you can use their casino and beach. Walgreens around the corner convenient for those things you forgot. All in all an excellent choice for a great price.

<Content>good budget hotel we weren't at this hotel long - we got there at almost midnight and left at 7am the next morning for a snorkeling trip. then we returned at 5pm to pick up our stuff we had stored and left for our cruise. the hotel was nice though. a good budget place- though we were surprised about the taxes. we got a rate of 95 dollars, but with tax it was almost 140! that was surprising, but oh well. what can you do?the rooms are super super small. we could barely fit our two suitecases in there and still move around. the floor is a concrete tile and cold, but seemed clean. the bed looked a little sketchy - very worn linens - but was comfortable. but perhaps that was because i was so tired! :) the bathroom was small, but clean with a decent sized shower.the continental breakfast was better than basic, i though. we had ham and cheese croissant - very nice to start the day. they also had yogurt, juice and coffee. i was happy.the common area is beautiful and the staff is very helpful (stored our luggage all day and called taxis for us). the only thing is, the hotel is hard to get to because of traffic. it is on a one way street that is very congested. we wasted a lot of time stuck in taxis. and it is still 15 dollars to either old san juan or the pan american pier for the cruise. but as long as you know that, no biggie.

<Content>Very quaint and cultural! We stayed at the Coral Princess Inn for 3 days before our cruise departed from San Juan- At first, I was a bit skeptical, but once I entered the lobby, I loved it! The lobby is a bit small and crowded ( especially if you arrive early and need to put your luggage down), but the room was clean and tidy! The water pressure was great! The personnel all spoke very good English and were very helpful. The outdoor terrace areas were surrounded by lush flowers and not much noise could be heard from the street. Very different from the high rise hotels down the block on Condado Beach. The continental breakfast was more than sufficient! Best of all, the location is great! One block away is the main street where there are tons of eateries, casinos and shops! We were able to walk through the Marriott and layout on their beach with no questions asked. Also won $700 on the dollar slots! We felt very safe also, especially having two teenage daughters. Would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Loved It I am a native to the Island currently living in Miami, Florida. All I have to say is that the Coral Princess highly exceeded my expectations. The hotel closely parallels the hotels you can find in South Beach. The rooms, although small, have high ceilings and large windows. There is a deck with a hot tub on the third floor and several lounge areas. The decor is very art deco and modern. The hotel was very clean and the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home. To our surprise the hotel provide free continental breakfast from 7:30 to 9:30. The hotel is walking distance to excellent restaurants, drug store, casino and beaches. You cannot go wrong !

<Content>Clean and comfy Clean and comfy, but can be a little bit noisy. If you're going to Old San Juan, get ready for a $10+ cab ride. Also, the continental breakfast was mediocre. All things considered, though, it was an extremely economical place to stay in San Juan and the staff was amazingly helpful and friendly.

<Content>Highly Recommend the Coral Princess My boyfriend  I stayed at the Coral Princess for 2 nights in May, and were 100% satisfied. Of couse, it is not the Hilton, but I felt the $125/night we paid was a steal. The room was small, but very clean with tasteful decor. The bathroom was good sized, included a jacuzzi tub, and appeared to have been recently remodelled. The common areas of this hotel were absolutely beautiful. The complimentary breakfast was basic, but good. There is a small pool (which you should not need since the beach is two blocks away!) and on the third floor, a hot tub. The third floor also has a large, home-like common area with kitchen, living, dining, and pool table. We did not use this, but it looked really nice. The beach is so close, and the Marriott casino is right around the bend. This hotel has prime location and is a great place to stay if you don't want to pay the money for a busy resort-hotel. Cab rides into Old San Juan were short, less than ten minutes, and relatively cheap (I think it was 12 for both of us). Plaza Las Americas is about a 5 minute cab ride.

<Content>Small quiet inn at the heart of Condado If you are looking for a quite inn, just a walk away from the beach and fine dining, then The Coral Princess Inn is for you. We found San Juan and Old San Juan to be crazy-- a lot of traffic and congestion. While The Coral Princess Inn is in the heart of Condado, it is quite and has a nice little court yard and pool. The staff were very friendly and even mailed my phone charger back to the states after I left it there!

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel for five nights in April 2006. The room was very quaint with an oil painting and nice furniture, with marble floors (a little small). Our room was very clean and I cannot relate to the other comments about being dirty. In fact, I thought it was above average with respect to cleaniness.The public areas and plants are simply lovely and very romantic.Our room faced the courtyard and it was at times noisy and I was awoken early in the morning and during an afternoon nap from loud guests sitting in the courtyard. I tried to change rooms, but there were no other options the first couple of nights. I was later showed some other rooms, but decided they were not as nice and/or bright as my room (Room 9) From my room, I had a wonderful view of the greenery, sunlight and sky.Although it was a little noisy, I would still highly recommend this hotel because the positives of the hotel clearly outweigh this small negative, especially considering the reasonable rates. I generally stay at five star hotels and thought this was a great alternative for a budget trip. In fact the staff was just as friendly as Four Seasons on the Big Island. They were wonderful, informative and soooo sweet. The owner was also very very nice.I recommend Angela's for dining which is a one minute walk from the hotel with great food and very reasonable prices. With respect to beaches, I would recommned walking down to Ocean Park. It's a local nice beach - very clean and swimmable. (about a 20 minute walk)

<Content>Very Dissapointed... A couple weeks ago, my husband and I had to overnight in San Juan before an early flight- after much research and reading reviews on Tripadvisor- I Chose The Coral Princess Inn- ( I must say that I have used Tripadvisor many times and truly trust the site based on the reviews I have gotten in the past and have not been dissapointed thus far) We chose CPI based on the location (10 minutes from the Airport) and several positive reviews on the website. There were a few negative reviews- but I chocked that up to Extra picky travelers. But I must say I was VERY dissapointed in the Coral Princess Inn- the rooms were very dirty-thank goodness there is no carpet-I can't imagine how dirty the carpet would have been-but the back of the door in the bathroom was filthy- the front side of the tub was grimy- and all of the electrical cords in the room had a thick layer of dust and grime on them- just to mention a few areas that caught my attention. Oh yes, and the air coming from the A/C unit smelled moldy  musty. The ceiling had water stains and cracks on it from a water leak in the past...Maybe- the suites are nicer- we did not see any other room options when there...I must say the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.They call themselves aboutique hotel and I do think the public areas were lovely- though, we didn't spend much time in them- and I think the original idea for the place was great- but, It was overall very dirty- and needs to be updated- The rooms need a fresh coat of paint and a DEEP cleaning!  So, I am sorry to report that we were dissapointed in this property.

<Content>Wonderful Stay! The Coral Princess Inn was a breath of fresh air for us. I happened upon it while searching for a pre-cruise hotel with consistent good reviews here on Trip Advisor. Coral Princess Inn was everything we expected and more. The rooms were large and extremely clean. We had an executive room which was a bit larger than the standard for $10.00 more. Some may call the furnishings a bit austere, but for us, they were comfortable and just enough. The staff at Coral Princess Inn were friendly and so helpful. Desk Clerk, Jason, recommended at great restaurant for lunch just a block from the hotel and on our way back from the beach (a mere 2 blocks away!). The included breakfast was a terrific way to start the day, and was plentiful and very fresh. The small courtyard area was filled with tropical plants and flowering orchids, which continued the Caribbean atmosphere. The third floor had a lovely seating area and hot tub, as well as a small lap pool on the second floor. Suites were located on the 3rd floor and looked beautiful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for clean, affordable, friendly, non-chain lodging in San Juan. We're looking forward to our next visit to the Coral Princess Inn.

<Content>Highly Recommended My husband and I stayed here for one night on our way from Oregon to Grenada in late February, 2006. The room was comfortable and clean, the staff very friendly and helpful (and spoke perfect English), the hotel itself was quaint and comfortable, with well kept gardens and the location was fabulous - especially in consideration of the reasonable rate we paid. After checking out, they securely stored our luggage until it was time to leave for the airport, so we were free to roam the beach and city for the day. We would stay here again, without hesitation!

<Content>Great for a short trip Our family (2 adults, 2 children) stayed at the Coral Princess in February. Overall it was quite a good experience. Our room had two double beds and was fairly small. The wardrobe was about 2ft wide by 2ft high, so a little small for the four of us. The bathroom was small and basic, but the kids loved the jacuzzi bath. There wasn't a coffee maker in the room which was a pity. There wasn't a room safe or iron/ironing board either.The guy on reception tried the 'hard sell' on excursions and kept phoning the room to see if we had made a decision! The tiny swimming pool was in the shade all afternoon, but the small hot tub on the roof was in a sun trap and was great.Breakfast was OK, nothing special, but quite edible.The aircon in the room was very noisy, but it was too warm to sleep without it.Would only recommend this hotel for a couple of nights at most. I would go back, but my husband wouldn't!

<Content>A Great Find! I've stayed at this small Inn twice, the first time was January '05 for three nights, and the second time for three nights this month. For me, it was a find as I tend to avoid high end American hotels, like the Marriott, with it's casino, tours, and overpriced food and drink. Ugh! As other reviewers have said, some rooms are small (mine was not) and very clean, but avoid Room #3, as it has no windows. I have found the staff to be knowledgable, helpful and friendly. Points that have not been mentioned in other reviews: there is a common seating area on the second floor for reading and coffee and a third floor deck with a hot tub. This, and sharing tables in the small breakfast area means that you naturally meet other guests from all parts of the U.S. and P.R. I enjoy this type of communal experience. It is a two block walk to the beach, and one block to Ashford Street where you can catch a bus into Old San Juan for $.75( $.35 for seniors). I have poked my head into several other budget hotels in the area (the Canarios and El Consulado) and I think the Coral Princess is the best of the bunch. I would definitely try to stay there again when I return to Puerto Rico.

<Content>Nice Find My friends and I spent one night here before a cruise and found the Coral Princess to be a quaint spot. The location is good, and for just a night or two, it's a great bargain. The artwork is gorgeous, the staff is pleasant and accomodating, and I loved the furniture designs. Others traveling with us were not thrilled with the small rooms, but my immediate group received a complimentary upgrade to one of the penthouse suites, and we were just fine. The whole upstairs area is great for entertaining if you have visitors while staying there. Overall, Coral Princess reminds me of European hotels--small with friendly staff and not too many extras. Not a 4 star, but I would definitely stay again, and I would recommend it for short stays.

<Content>pretty standard, good location Me and my wife stayed at Coral Princess Inn on November 2005. The hotel has a very good location and the area is quiet and decent. We are not the type of people to whine about the change of sheets and spots on the walls, but there seemed to be a major problem with their air conditioning at the room we were staying in.We got that little room no 12 for 99 USD per night on the second floor. The temperature in the room was never under 32 degrees celcius and we found it hard to sleep sometimes.

<Content>Coral Princess is a Good Value in Coranando - not spectacular My husband and I, along with another couple in their 40's, stayed at this hotel in early January. POSITIVES: in the heart of Condado and just a 2 minute walk to beach. It's near the Marriott (WAY overpriced drinks at their outdoor bar, don't bother), Walgreens and within walking distance of a nice variety of restaurants. They also had a nice little buffet breakfast of fluffy croissants, cheese, ham, cereal, yogurt and wonderful P.R. coffee. It's a good deal given the location and what you get, nice smaller hotel with tiny pool (never used) and hot tub (that was only 85 degrees) NEGATIVES: rooms are small, marble floors in room (it may be just me, but I much prefer carpet), no view from room and they charge $1.00 just to pick up the phone. Also, this may be minor as well, but it was really tough to get the shower at a decent temperature -- it was either too hot or too cold.I would recommend this for people who won't be spending alot of time in their rooms (we didn't) and value budget over luxury. I've stayed at nicer smaller hotels, but this is fine, nothing great.Puerto Rico is wonderful! I'd highly recommend a snorkeling trip with East WInd Excursions to aqua clear island snorkeling and tours by Rafael to El Yunque Rain Forest. Isla Verde Beach is wonderful, just a few miles down. Old San Juan merits a morning visit as well.

<Content>Crooks We stayed at this hotel one night before and one night after our cruise. The first night was fine, not what I expected from all the good reviews but was acceptable for a night. After the cruise we go to check in for our second night and was told that we didn't have a reservation, BUT that we were charged a no show for a night that was 2 days before our cruise and the desk clerk admitted it was hotel error. I was given a letter saying my card would be credited. I waited 1 week and the account was never credited, I emailed them after that and after another week of waiting I had to file a fraudelant charge claim with my bank and get a new debit card. I never received any kind of response from this hotel at all and even had expedia.com contact them.Also the second night since my reservation was lost we were stuck in a room on the backside of the hotel and were up until 2 a.m. because the building next door was having some kind of party. Sorry for the rant.

<Content>A bit rough around the edges We stayed here for the last night during our trip to catch an early morning flight the next day. (We stayed near the rainforest the rest of the trip).The location is very convenient to Rt 26 which takes you to San Juan to the west, and the airport to the east. Having read all the raves on Tripadvisor prior to our arrival, however, I was slightly disappointed by the hotel. Our room was small (about 12x12). With a queen size bed, a desk and a TV cabinet, it felt crammed. I looked at two other rooms - one about the same size as ours with a queen size bed, and another that's bigger with a king size bed, for $20 more. I was told that all the rooms with queen beds are small. Since we were only staying for one night, we decided to keep our room.There was an unclean feel to the room that I couldn't quite place. Perhaps it was the heavy grain marble floor, or the dullness of it. For a new hotel, the furnishing was unexpectedly worn: the headboard rattled with the slightest movement in bed, and the paint on the desk was worn to bare wood in a few places. Perhaps what got to me the most was the dubious little black balls of lint/dirt in the bedsheet. We paid $130 with tax for one night. For longer stays, I recommend paying extra for a bigger room. However, for the same price, you could do better with some of the BB's or vacation rentals in the Condado/Ocean Park/Isla Verde area.A last word about parking - there are four parking spaces in front of the hotel, one of which is handicap reserved parking. If those are taken, parking is available at a nearby hotel for $10 every 24 hrs, or you may be able to find a spot on the street.

<Content>Nice little hotel, friendly staff My wife and I stayed at the Coral Princess Inn for 3 days during October. The room was clean and well maintained. One thing we will remember about the room is that AC was freezing!!! But that isn't a bad thing. The CPI is in walking distance to all of Condado as well as on the bus route for taking a trip to Old San Juan or to Isle de Verde. Great price too!

<Content>Don't miss this one! The Coral Princess is a fabulous, boutique hotel in the Condado, only a block away from the beach. Lots of beautifully appointed common areas, rooftop setup perfect for sunset cocktails, and lovely, albeit small, pool area. Short walk to the beautiful beach and great restaraunts. If you want the expensive, mega-resort experience, go ahead and book a room at Dorado, but you could just as well be in Miami. If you want to experience the lovely hospitality and culture of Puerto Rico, book the Coral Princess at a quarter of the price, and still get first class rooms and friendly, attentive service. We'll be back!

<Content>Lovely hotel This is a boutique hotel in the touristy Condado section of San Juan. It is close to the beach and near many restaurants. You can take a bus for 25c to Old San Juan and Avis car hire is nearby.The rooms are sparkling clean and have modern amenities like phone, internet access, fridge, hair dryer and jacuzzi bathtub. The hotel has lovely communal areas including a meeting rooms, a kitchen, sitting areas with lots of plants, a pool and a jacuzzi.The staff are really helpful and booked our cave and bioluminiscent bay kayak tours for us.My husband and I stayed 4 nights for our anniversary and absolutely loved it for it's comfort, friendliness and ideal location. Would stay there again!

<Content>Nice Hotel, Questionable Location The Coral Princess was clean and attractive. The pool is small but appealing and the hot tub was great. We were there during the low tourism season, so often we were the only ones using the tub and pool. The continental breakfast was nice, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. The hotel is only about a $15 cab ride to and from the airport and about $10 to the cruise pier.The downfall of this hotel is the fact the it is surrounded by pretty dumpy places next door and across the street. In fact, I was concerned about going outside after dark the first night we were there. Even though we did venture out after dark subsequently, I still felt insecure once we got off the main drag (Condado) which is about 4 blocks away. This is not the fault of the hotel obviously, but it is something to consider if you are picky about the neighborhood where you stay.We were there 3 nights, and I would not want to stay there longer than that. We probably will not return to PR, but if we did I would not stay in this hotel again because of the condition of the surrounding buildings/area.I highly reccomend other hotels on the main strip because the area is much nicer.Also, the beach was beautiful. It was about 4 blocks away. However, no swimming is permitted because of heavy seas and sharp rocky terrain. If you are a beach person, I would double check to see if you can stay at a hotel with beach access.

<Content>Not the best! After reading all the great reviews I decided to stay four nights at the Coral Princess Inn. Staff was helpful but pool was very small. Breakfast was OK nothing to rave about. Beach was a couple of blocks away and the local students drink and party during the day so there was no relaxation time. You can rent chairs and umbrellas for $3.00. The bus ride into San Juan is .25 cents but you often have to wait 45 minutes to an hour or more. Basically if I did not pay upfront I would have stayed at a better location. The area was not tourist friendly some local restaurants staff were rude and very overpriced average meal for two between $60 and $80. Next time I鈥檒l stay in Old San Juan or Isle Verde. Also the hotel charges $8.00 per day service fee.

The free breakfast was more than we expected and the staff was so friendly and helpful. The beach is only a few blocks away and we felt safe when we were walking. A great hotel for the price.

<Content>Coral Princess is the Best!! Coral Princess Inn is a very nice hotel in an ideal location. The staff is friendly, the rooms are extremely clean and cool, and the parking is not too far away. Obviously it would be ideal if it had parking right at the hotel but the walk is not even five minutes so it doesn't really take away from the hotel. We didn't swim in the pool but we saw it and it looked very clean. We did not check out the jacuzzi either. It's not a far drive from Old San Juan and as previous posts have mentioned, you can take a cab or the bus. I recommend this hotel whole heartedly....We will definetely stay there again, we loved it...

<Content>Excellent - I can't recommend this enough! This is an excellent place to stay for the beach at Condado and local restaurants, shops and bars (a 3 minute walk). Rooms are spotlessly clean, with air conditioning - the inn also has a small pool and a jacuzzi, washing machine facilities and TV and internet access in every room. A buffet breakfast is available from 6-10 (coffee, juice, croissants, ham, cheese, fruit etc). Travel to Old San Juan is easy (the bus stop for the B21 is right around the corner) - although beware - the B21 is infrequent and the last bus leaves San Juan at 9pm. It costs 25 cents one-way so it's worth using if it arrives - a cab into Old San Juan is a 10 minute ride for $8-10.This inn has all the advantages of a small hotel - secure, quiet, well maintained, with a personal service. If you want a hotel with a bar, room service, casino etc - this certainly isn't for you.Our stay here for 6 days was excellent and we certainly plan to return.

<Content>Loved It! My family and I went to Puerto Rico during the week of 6/20 to 6/25. We stayed at the Coral Princess Inn. We canot stop raving about the hotel. We had nice comfortable, clean rooms. The rooms had a little refrigerator with a small freezer. The continential breakfast is great too. There is a nice patio in the back to enjoy your breakfast. The front desk is very friendly and informatative. The hotel is located in Condado San Juan. It is near shops, restaurants and transportation. There is a bus stop across the street. Also there is access to the other hotel if interested in going to the casinos. Condado Beach is a block 1/2 away. We had a wonderful time and would definitely stay the next time around.

<Content>Small clean friendly  Just returned from a cruise which started  ended in San Juan  used the Coral Princess as our base before  after.Excellent small  friendly hotel. I tried it after reading so many positive reviews on this site  I was not disappointed!We were lucky enough to have the top floor suite as an upgrade on the first night (before the cruise) and took full advantage of the roof terrace, indoor  outdoor jacquzzis, and a pool table in the living room. Great!On our return we had a standard room but found you can still use the terrace, tubs  pool table...and you have a whirlpool bath in every room anyway!.The breakfast buffet (continental style) was a treat in the lovely airy covered patio on the ground floor, with a good selection of cereals, juice,ham cheese pastries etc.And there's a small but clean  level swimming pool with no deep end, so great if you are a nervous swimmer.Just one downside...the taxi fare to the port cost us around $15-$20 each way, even though it's not that far. So a portside hotel, may be more expensive but at least you would be on site for the cruise. But if you just want to get into Old Town San Juan (which is beautiful) then take the frequent quick  clean buses....it's just 25cents per person!!

<Content>Very Nice Hotel My wife and I stayed at this Hotel from 5/6 thru 5/9.. We had a top floor suite. The room was very large with a large bathroom (very clean). We had a mini refrig in our room which came in very handy..As stated in the other reviews parking can be an issue, however, in the Condado area you really do not need a car to get around..So simply get a parking spot and leave your car there..The bus stop to Old San Juan is a short walk away, as well as, all restaurants..My only complaints and they were minor were the room did not have tissues and maid service did not make-up the room until 4:00pm each day. Breakfast was simple and basic but very filling and fresh. Desk management was very friendly and very helpful with directions and suggesting and making restaurant reservations.. I have stayed at the Wind Chimes hotel in the past and would recommend the Coral Princess over it and I would definetly stay at the Coral Princess again.

<Content>True hospitality made a rainy week pleasant. Greetings! My wife and I booked from May 13th 2005 thru the 19th.From the moment we arrived Manager Luis and his staff made our stay extremely pleasant during an entire week of rain. His assistant, (wish I could remember her name, a short haired angel) went out of her way to help us recommending excellent restaurants, tours tips etc. We felt very comfortable and relaxed here, with personalized service. We were on a bus stop headed to the Plaza American mall when we heard a driver honking his horn, turned out to be Luis and he gave us a ride to the mall...that was cool! Surrounded by some big busy hotel-casinos,this building itself is so beautiful, marble floors,very clean, oil paintings all over,trees and exotic plants ,complimentary breakfast every day and a comfortable room with icy-cold AC's. A stones throw from everything I highly recommend this Inn. I am soooo glad we did not end up in one of the larger hotels.We will return hopefully the sun will be out! Peace...DJ Ray and Donna, NYC.

<Content>A+++++++++++ My husband and I stayed at the Coral Princess Inn for 2 days prior to going on a cruise in April 2005. I must say I have stayed in many hotels some very expensive and well known but none ever as great as this one. The staff was great and the room was very nice and inexpensive. The hotel is decorated in non typical hotel furnishing but ones that I would decorate my own home with. The floors and bathroom walls are marble and extremly clean. I would go back to San Juan and stay at the Coral Princess Inn anyday over the well know hotels. The upper level patio was great. I would advise anyone going to San Juan, PR to definatly book with them.

<Content>Safe Haven We stayed here for one night on a forced layover on our way from the US to BVI on our honeymoon. The front desk was very polite, informative, helpful, courteous, and trustworthy. My wife actually forgot her wallet on the chair in the lobby and they held it until we came back through the lobby. The hotel was locked at all times so not just anyone can come in and they know immediately who you are, your name, and you're best interest. The rooms were average to small but clean. The beach is 2 blocks away but i was cautioned that it might not be the safest place. The water was rough and the beach was 'busy' with tourist, locals, vendors, and in my opinion not very relaxing, but we obviously weren't there for the beach anyway. It didn't seem to me like there was much around to see or do otherwise. We took a bus to old san juan which was about a good 40 minute ride during 'happy hour'. We lucked out b/c there was a festival there which was alot of fun. The local buses are dirt cheap and pick up / stop a block away from the coral princess (near the pharmacy which i believe is open 24hrs). Taking a taxi could cost you a fortune and renting a car is a complete waste of money b/c you will literally get run off the road if you try to drive against those locals. I'm not kidding when i say they drive on the sidewalks and they drive full throttle / full horn. Even riding on the bus was like being in a scene from the movie 'Speed'. If you're looking for a fancy hotel or a quaint little BB this boutique hotel is neither. Rather, I think of this place as a 'safe haven' when traveling. I would go back there again b/c it's relatively close to the airport (20 minute taxi ride which the hotel arranges for you), fairly priced, and feels safe, however i would also like to try el Convento which consistently gets good reviews or somewhere in Old San Juan (b/c there's more to walk around and see, shop, dine, etc).

<Content>Nice little hideaway My husband  I stayed one night at this wonderful inn, prior to a cruise. We found the people at the front desk to be very helpful. Our plane landed at 7:00pm and it was just about 7:30pm when we checked in and we were hungry. The lady behind the desk gave us several choices of places all just a block away and of course told us where the Wal-greens was as we forgot a couple of items and needed to get a lighter since they now won't allow them on airplanes. We had Room #17 with a King bed and cost us $165 all taxes, etc included, I think it was $135/$145 or something like that before taxes. Room was very clean, bed was confortable and had plenty to choose from on the TV. I took a shower that night so I could sleep in a little the next morning and not sure if everyone was showering to go out to dinner or what but the temperature of the water kept going from very hot to cold to perfectly warm so I had to keep moving in and out of the water - water pressure was great though. The next morning my husband took a shower and he didn't have this problem so not sure what the reason was that it acted this way with me but just thought I'd mention it as an FYI.At checkout there was another couple ahead of who were disputing phone charges that came up on their bill, they even occured prior to them checking into the hotel so knew they were incorrect. Management credited them so they didn't have to pay and then when we got our bill the same thing happened! Of course we didn't have to pay either but make sure you look at your final bill just in case.Even with these little items I would stay here again in a heartbeat - the character of the building, common areas and rooms was wonderful, you can stay at a cookie cutter hotel anywhere, we wanted something more of a local feel and I would say this has it. Enjoy!

<Content>Wonderful Outdoor Facilities I just got back from an 8 days stay at the Coral Princess Inn with my husband and 9 months old baby. We liked the hotel a lot, especially the outdoor facilities (seating area in front of our room and sundeck with jacuzzi!). The rooms + bathrooms are clean and well maintained and ours had a microwave and a fridge (which cannot be missed when vacationing with a baby). Also, the breakfast area / patio is lovely with all the plants and flowers. I had asked for an infant crib when I made the reservation but uppon arrival it turned out to be broken. After calling the front desk about it however, the hotel owner went out to buy a new crib (at 9.30 pm) which was installed for us within the hour. The staff was helpful and nice. The only suggestions to the management would be more closet space and a bit more variety in the breakfast (but its free so what can I say...) I would certainly recommend this hotel if you like a small, layed back, bedbreakfast like accomodation.

<Content>Verify your check out time! The hotel itself is clean, pleasant and close to a lovely beach, restaurants and shops. However, we had three complaints.Firstly, unlike the other hotels where we stayed in Puerto Rico (Coral Princess was the third one after a few weeks of traveling throughout the island), there was no bathroom/shower facility to use after the beach once we had checked out. It was our last day and we wanted to go for one last dip in the sea after we had checked out but could not do so since they did not have this amenity. Typically hotels near beaches have this facility, so were a bit surprised. Secondly, parking is impossible to find, so the hotel will direct you to a private parking lot service up the street where you have to pay ten dollars to park per day. The money was not an issue, but unloading and loading the suitcases before moving the cars was (two cars and six girls - a lot of luggage!).And lastly, we were given a printed confirmation before we even got there that our check-out time was at noon. We planned our day accordingly only to be told at the last minute that we had to check out at eleven, which led to an unpleasant argument with the front-desk staff and a scramble to collect our things after breakfast. Overall I would say that after the other hotels we had experienced in Puerto Rico, the Coral Princess was not impressive. But it is definitely less expensive, and if you know what to expect in advance regarding parking, showers and check-out times, it should work out well.

It has beautiful rooms with floors in marble and each bath has a jacuzzi bathtubs!! It has a enchanting patio with tropical flowers, terracota tiles and a marvlous mobiliary, a little but confortable pool and very kind personnel.Definitively I will visit this great place again.

<Content>Very quaint, but small rooms We just returned from a stay at the Coral Princess (Mar 21-24,'05). We really liked the place - cute, quaint, nice dipping pool, lovely gardens and very nice staff. Our room was very small, but ok for just a few nights. This is a great location to bus (that goes to Old SJ for .25), restaurants, etc. There is a Wal-Greens just around the corner for those forgotten items. We felt very comfortable walking the around even at 10-11pm. They serve a continental breakfast that is just ok. Not much to choose from and the very same every morning! For the price, $176/nt (we got shafted due to spring break), we probably would not stay there again. All in all, it was fine and it really is in a great location - the larger hotels around that area were about $100 more.

<Content>Great hosts....A wonderful experience My family (wife, and children 8 and 11 year old) and I stayed at the Coral Princess located in Condado 2/19 and 2/20, Washington's Birthday weekend, prior to our cruise. We waited till the last minute and were scrambling a week before to find a place to stay. Nothing was available, no Marriott, no Wyndham, nothing. After looking on line at what was available (not very appealing) , I tried calling some of the highly rated smaller hotels and asking for vacancy or advice where to stay. Two calls led me to the Coral Princess. The only vacancy they had was the penthouse, which cost less than a room at the Marriott a block away. Right upon our arrival we were thrilled. We loved the rooftop hot tub. We loved the kitchen and dining area (we were so tired the first night, we brought back take out) The hotel was very clean!! The marble floor tiles in the room were a nice touch. We loved the continental breakfast on the downstairs patio. The hotel staff was so friendly. The hotel location was excellent, very close to many restaurants and the beach. The hotel staff go out of their way to make your stay special. They even allowed us to store our bags with them after checkout so we could walk around and enjoy the day before we went to the cruise ship.On Saturday night were looking for a restaurant. Ellen, who I think was the manager, must have spent a half hour calling various restaurants trying to get us a table. Being Washington's Birthday weekend it was tough finding getting a reservation. The restaurant she booked us at was outstanding.I looked at a lot of hotel reviews for San Juan hotels on line. There seems to be a prevailing issue with cleanliness/shabbiness/quality. That is not a problem at the Coral Princess!!

<Content>We were very impressed My husband and I just returned from spending a few days in San Juan. We booked the Coral Princess based on reviews found on this website and we were very impressed. Living in the Caribbean we travel to San Juan quite a bit and have stayed at many hotels and this one was a pleasant surprise. We found the staff to be very helpful and the rooms were impeccably clean and tended to promptly each day. The continental breakfast, each morning, was very nice and a good time to mingle with other guests. I thought the price was very reasonable considering it is the high season and also the location, which is right in the center of Condado. This part of the world is very pricey, so if you are looking for a bargain, I think this is definitely it. Everyone and every place has an off day and that has to be considered. However, I can honestly say, we only experienced great things at this hotel and hopefully we will continue to stay there for many trips to come.p.s. there are mini-bars in the rooms with the cheapest prices I've ever seen!

<Content>Beware of This - It May Not be What you Think The pictures were beautiful and the public area wes, BUT:I have stayed at a lot of hotels/motels because I travel a lot.This was by far the VERY WORST I've ever experienced, andat a far greater cost than many.I paid $132 for a room that was so small a king size would havefit wall to wall. The bed was made to fit the room, not a single but not a double, consequently the sheets didn't fit on the homemade lumpy mattress. You couldn't walk around the bed at all, you had to kinda sidle around. All the furniture in the room was made of cheap plywoodpainted black! There was a hugh black plywood box by the side ofthe bed, to go to the bathroom you had to slide by it. Absolutly the worst - I was tired when I got there so I didn't object to what Iwas given, BUT IT CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE!They didn't even have a bedside clock or facial tissues!Then as if that wasn't bad enough, the staff allowed a couple olderguests to annoy the rest of the guest until after 3 in the morning.At 12:00 a.m. I called the desk to ask when the swimming pool closed.They did go down and move them out of there, but they then went to the open courtyard in the middle. They couple continued to talkvery loudly, with the high-pitched giggle that some older women have.Needless to say IT WAS ANNOYING! I made another call to desk an hour later, I had to get up early to catch my flight out. They didgo down and talk to them again. Well, we lost the old lady, but theold man went into the piano and doodled until after 3:00 a.m.. Thefront desk was on the same floor, just around the corner and theydid nothing. The other guests should have been entitled to someconsideration. WE DIDN'T GET IT!As I say, beware of the Coral Princess Inn - they are a scam and should not get your business!ROOM 8 - March 2, 2005

<Content>Good Deal, charming hotel I stayed here in Feb '05, I must admit I was not at all impressed with the general SJ area and beaches but I did enjoy my stay in the hotel. The rooms are well equipped and comfortable, my first one was very dark on the 2nd floor but I asked to be moved and they accommodated me. The staff are very friendly, everything is spotlessly clean and I enjoyed starting my day with breakfast in the charming garden.I saw lots of really bad hotels and Inns in this area that looked like they had not been renovated for many years so I was happy with my choice! I booked this hotel on the strength of Tripadvisor reviews which proved to be very accurate!I don't think I will be visiting SJ again but if I do I would definitely stay here again and thoroughly recommend it!

<Content>Striving to be the best and it is!!! My wife and I stayed at the Coral Princess Inn on Feb 25th and 26th, 2005 as well as March 6th. We were taking a cruise and knowing the potential for snow in New England, we decided to arrive two days early. As luck would have it, snow arrived on the morning of our departure. I was able to contact the hotel to let them know of our delay in arrival and they were more than accomodating in assuring us that the desk is available 24/7 to check us in since our flight to San Juan would not arrive until after midnight. Upon arrival, we were told that the guest in our room had a medical emergency and we had been upgraded to the penthouse suite. Our rating of this hotel is not because of this upgrade but instead because of the excellent customer service afforded us during our stay and the spotless and tidy cleanliness of the rooms. My wife had suffered a sprained ankle prior to arriving in San Juan and during our first morning at the Coral Princess Inn, the front desk called and wanted to know if they could run out and get us anything that we needed especially room service.(there is no restaurant at the hotel) In addition, I came down with a sinus infection that same day which caused me great discomfort. Not only did they consider this important but they recommended that I go to the hospital emergency room, called us a cab, and promised to hold our checkout procedure as long as possible. As it turned out, we were back before 11:00 am and in time for our regular departure. And finally, I had bought some beer that I was unable take on the cruise with me but they were kind enough to hold it until my return in one week. It sure tasted good as we waited for our room to be ready on March 6th. Without question, this hotel ranks as the best hotel we have ever stayed at in our many excursions because of their continued effort to put customer service ahead of anything else. San Juan is home to many cruise ships, so book early and stay late--You will not be disappointed.

<Content>A Good Choice in San Juan My husband and I stayed in this hotel for two nights in early December 2004. The location is in a pleasant part of town near the beach and an easy $.25 bus ride to Old San Juan. Our room was small but attractively furnished with a nice bathroom. The breakfast was just okay, but the breakfast area was very attractive. The staff was friendly and helpful, and overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Coral Princess. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. We had never been to San Juan before, and loved the city!

<Content>A Really Pretty Place to Stay My husband and I just spent a week at the Coral Princess. It's not a luxury hotel, but it is lovely, with more of the feel of a guesthouse than a hotel. The rooms and public areas are classy - nicely decorated rooms and outdoor public areas with beautiful ceramic tile and lush greenery. Everybody there we came in contact with was friendly and helpful when required, most especially the manager, who gave us advice and then asked follow-up questions to find out how it went.We stayed in the handicap room because it was the only one available with a kitchenette, which we needed because we had to bring our own food for lunch and dinner. It, as well as the room, is small, but we managed OK. There was sometimes a musty smell in the room, which dissipated when we turned up the air conditioner, and the hot water took a very long time to heat up (but once it did it was fine). The bathroom has the feel of a commercial bathroom, which I didn't like because it wasn't pretty, but logically it's appropriate for the room. The upside was that the room is right on the ground floor with the beautiful outdoor courtyard and breakfast area right outside. This was great because even though there is a small table in the room that we could have eaten at, instead we were easily able to take our food right outside and eat at the tables set up for the breakfast. The continental breakfast they served was fine. The neighborhood is great. There are a lot of things for tourists, but it is also somewhat residential and not tacky at all. It also felt very safe. The Walgreen's around the corner was great to have, because it is open 24 hrs. and sold just about everything you could imagine except fresh fruit, which I found in a grocery story down Ashford Ave. The beach is very close by, and is the same beach that the Marriot Hotel opens onto. It is very clean and beautiful, and you could rent lounge chairs right there for $3.00/day. We rented a car and it was very easy to get to the highway from the hotel. The parking was not a problem - in addition to the 4 hotel spots and the backup parking for $10 down the block, there was street parking, which we were able to find right across the street. I would definitely recommend Puerto Rico, the Condado neighborhood, and the Coral Princess.

<Content>Great hotel for the price My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night before a cruise of Feb. 11, 2005. The hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was small but clean and contained everything we needed. The hotel is two blocks from the heart of the Condado area and a 25 cent bus ride from Old San Juan. The breakfast was nothing fancy, but consisted of cold cereal, oatmeal, sweet rolls, yogurt, and fruit. Just enough to kickstart your day! I thought this hotel was an exceptional value for the money and would not hesistate to stay here again for a day or two. If you are going to stay longer, you would probably want to go with one of the bigger hotels in Condado.

<Content>Great Value My girlfriend and I just got back from a 5 day stay at the Coral Princess and loved it. We stayed in the penthouse (3rd floor). The room was big (only two penthouse rooms on the 3rd floor) and cleanly kept by the staff. The room has a small balcony leading onto a roof patio with a small jacuzzi. The hotel is 1/2 block from Walgreens and two blocks from the beach. A nice Argentinian restaurant is locked within 100 feet of the hotel. The staff was friendly and very helpful in recommending bars  restaurants. This hotel is a great value if you are looking for something that cost less than the chain hotels located just a few blocks away (the Marriott is about 1 1/2 blocks). The continental breakfast was nice but nothing special....that's about the worst thing I can say about the Coral Princess. I would definitely stay there again.Also, we highly recommend taking the rainforest tour. We toured with Sunshine Tours. The guide's name was Rupert. He was very knowledgeable, a gentleman and a great conversationalist. After touring the rainforest we stopped by Loquilla beach which was okay but nothing special. The rainforest is a must, Loquilla beach is not.

<Content>Great hotel for the money!! We stayed at the Coral Princess 1/29-2/3 and loved it. We stayed on the Penthouse (3rd floor) level and pretty much had the whole space to ourselves. It has a beautifully decorated common area with couches, tables, full kitchen, pool table and a wonderful rooftop deck with a great little jacuzzi.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the continental breakfast was nicely done. The entire hotel is very well kept and sweet. We were close to the beach, Walgreen's and all the good restaurants, three blocks from Avis, where we rented a car several days, and a short cab ride from Old San Juan.We recommend Cieto Lindo, a very yummy  affordable Mexican restaurant just a block from the hotel on Magdalena. Be careful driving in Puerto Rico. The road signs are horrible and the drivers are worse. There are no rules in Puerto Rico!!! I recommend you buy a good road map at a book store, prior to your trip, if you plan on doing any driving.Other than that, we had an amazing time, and this hotel is the perfect resting place.

<Content>Good, clean hotel, with great service We stayed 1/16 - 1/18, and found the Coral Princess to be clean and the service to be very friendly.The hotel is in a great area with lots of restaurants within a short walking distance. In particular we went to Miro's about a block and a half away, at the recommendation of the front desk. The food was excellent.There was a pool, and hot tub, however, we did not end up using them.The breakfast consisted of sweet rolls, juice, and ham and cheese. The area to eat in was clean. I loved all the orchids.Would stay here again.

<Content>Very Impressive!!! I am so incredibly glad that we decided to stay at the Coral Princess Inn. It is a beautiful hotel that is kept very clean and well-decorated. We stayed for three nights in the beginning of January as part of our honeymoon. When we arrived we were told that our room was penthouse 3. We only paid $99 a night and our room and amenities were fantastic! Just outside of our room (small but very nice) we had a beautiful living room, kitchen with stainless steel appliances, a pool table and dining room. As far as I know, anyone could take advantage of these rooms. I know that several people came up to play pool. At the end of our floor was the huge deck area with hot tub that anyone can access. The breakfast in the morning was small but nice with a very relaxing setting. Another poster must have missed it because it is tucked away but there is an outdoor pool on one side of the hotel. Overall, we were very happy with our stay and would recommend it to anyone heading to San Juan!

<Content>Good location, good rate Great location, friendly  helpful staff. The only negative comments I have are that the hot tub  sun deck are reserved for the occupants of the penthouse and someone left the window open and it left a stain on the roman shade. The room was clean, even under the bed. Free high speed internet access, cable TV which we actually watched as it rained all week (can't blame the hotel for that). Breakfast was a bit lacking, but it was free.Overall I would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Recommended hotel but with some recommendations to the staff Last January 4th I stayed at this charming hotel. The hotel is hip and in and excellent location. Compared to other hotels in the Condado area, this one is one of the most updated, clean and well kept. The staff needs to get a little bit of training on hospitality. Upon our arrival the guy in the front left us waiting for about 20 minutes and there was nobody else we could speak to for checking in. Also, the cart of the cleaning lady was in the lobby and when we tried to move it so that we could go accross the lobby the lady yelled at us and the guy on the front desk didn't apologize on her behalf. Parking is limitted. Another recommendation will be that for such beautiful decor the bed covers should be all white as well as the sheets on the beds. The current linens don't match the sophistication and style that the hotel wants to portray. The breakfast in the morning(which was included on the price) was absolutely great and well presented. The breakfast area was relaxing and absolutely gorgeous full of orchids and tropical plants. Even though I make these suggestions to the management of the hotel I will rate the hotel like one of the best kept secrets in the Condado area, which is well worth the try.

<Content>A Good Experience Clean, convenient, comfortable place to stay. The staff was helpful and friendly. They arranged a tour of El Yunque rain forest for us that was excellent. Breakfast was more than adequate. Easy walk to the beach, casinos and plenty of good restaurants. The bus to old San Juan is a block away and the return bus stop is steps away. Would recommend to friends and would stay there again.

<Content>Recommended My boyfriend and I stayed at the Coral Pincess Inn at the beginning of December. Overall the Inn is great - 9 out of 10. Key facts are: it's spotlessly clean everywhere. With no exceptions, the staff are incredibly nice, friendly and helpful. The place has a funky feel as it has pretty minimal decoration plus some interesting modern art by a local artist (they have her contact details at reception if you want to buy). Everything you need is very local - the local store is the Walgreens half a block away and the beach is 2 blocks away. The Inn serves a cold breakfast that is ok. Drawbacks for the new visitor: The rooms are on the small side but we were hardly there so that was fine with us. All we wanted was a clean, well air conned room with a shower that worked. Which is what you get.There is no pool. (The spa on the roof is ok but the let the whole of the top floor, incuding the spa, on day 3 and so it was out of bounds from then on).We went in December for 6 days. 3 of those days were wet with heavy rain for the majority of the time. The good news is that San Juan has enough to do for when it is rainy (unlike some other Caribbean islands). Also, the other three days were beautiful with strong sunshine and temps in 80s.The beach by the Inn is not your typical Caribbean ideal beach. It on the windward side of the island so this means you get a small bit of sand, a steep drop off, lots and lots of wind and big waves. We loved the waves (they actually made the holiday for us) but if you want tranquil, blue and 'all you can hear is waves gently washing the beach' silence go elsewhere or treck to other parts of the island.Gay-wise, the area is cool with gays but the club is 10 mins taxi ride and the (large) gay bar near the Inn (4 blocks away) was dead day and night. December is not obviously not peak gay season!I would definitely stay here if I came to PR again.

<Content>Great Location and mostly helpful This is a cute hotel two blocks from Condado Beach. The front desk had some great people and a couple that were the exception. The continental breakfast was less than average, but there are some great spots on Ashford where the food is inexpensive and excellent for breakfast......and lunch......and dinner as well. One of the great people at the front desk set up a wonderful snorkeling trip that all four of us loved. We stayed at the hotel during the winter holidays - Xmas through New Years and had a wonderful break from our crazy life.

<Content>Clean, nice decor, OK rates My new wife and I spent 7 days and nights at the Coral Princess for our Honeymoon in Puerto Rico. The room was always clean, the decor was charming (a mix of traditional Spanish with some local artwork and tasteful modern furniture) and the staff generally helpful. The breakfast was OK; a non-varying assortment of pastries, orange juice, coffee, bananas, wrapped slices of cheese and lunchmeat with croissant bread. The hot tub on the 3rd floor was unavailable for general use, and the one occasion that we did get to use it, it did not work properly anyway. Inexplicably, there was always only one small drinking glass available in the room, but since I never asked for another, I suppose I cannot complain. The shower was OK, but lacked much force in the streams and would frequently cycle between warm and cold for no apparent reason. The price ($110 a night, plus tax, plus an energy surcharge of around $8.00 a day that I was previously unaware of, seemed a little steep for the room size and amenities). The BIG question - would I stay there again? Yes, without a doubt, BUT I would certainly check for bargains from other places. AND one more hint - DO NOT rent a car except for the days you plan to do a lot of driving. Driving and parking are OK at times, major headaches at others. Take the bus, publicos, or a taxi and save money and aggravation. Go see El Yunque and Old San Juan - don't bother going to Ponce unless you are fond of finding your way through labyrinth-style unmarked streets that go only in one direction. All told, our vacation in PR and our stay in the Coral Princess were very memorable. Hope your vacation is wonderful.

<Content>Utterly Charming! We just returned from a stay in P.R. Unfortunately only one night was spent at the Coral Princess. Even though business meetings took us to a much fancier name hotel for the rest of our stay, we kept saying that we wished we could've stayed here the entire time. The room, while small, was very clean and very pretty. Nice jacuzzi tub with lots of hot water. [The shower, however, was dissapointing - not much more than a drip!] It was quiet, the staff was super friendly and helpful, the flowers and plants were beautiful. Very near several restaurants, a Walgreen's, and the beach. Very nice breakfast, also [the cheese fingers pastry recommended by the attendant were yummy!]. I would love to go back someday!

<Content>Wonderful Stay The Coral Princess Inn was a wonderful choice for my husband and I. The staff is wonderful and the rooms, though small, are cool. We loved the spa tubs and the marble floors. It's also centrally located and easy to get around the island from its location. The price can't be beat, but I don't expect it to stay so low for long. It seems like a secret that is too good to keep.

<Content>Convenient Location My husband and I stayed Nov. 5-6 2004 with another couple in a double room prior to a cruise. The hotel is small, close to bus transportation, beach and restaurants. We found the double room to be quite small but clean. The double beds were comfortable however the room contained a strong damp odor and the front desk provided plug in air fresheners. When we stayed, there was a very loud outdoor party with music one night that prevented sleeping and since the hotel was fully booked we were unable to move. Nice continental breakfast is served in a garden courtyard. There is a outdoor dipping pool to cool off adjacent to the courtyard. Front desk staff is welcoming and helpful. We all agreed that we would probably not stay again if given other options.

<Content>Comfortable and Clean! Stayed one night prior to cruise and the rooms were extremely clean. Marble tile floors kept the room really cold - it was great! Jacuzzi tub looks brand new! Bed was comfortable. Rooms are cozy yet comfortable in size although we didn't spend much time in our room other than to sleep. We didn't have time to use the pool or hot tub but we checked them out and they looked clean. The tropical plants and orchids were a nice touch! Coral Princess is one block from Ashford Ave (near the Marriott Hotel) - convenient to shopping, dining, and public transportation. We took the bus (around the corner near Walgreens) for $.25/person to the last stop in Old San Juan where we picked up the free trolley for our own tour of the City as the hotel staff had advised. Also, the hotel staff allowed us to leave our luggage with them (locked in the office) after we checked out so we could explore the city before we boarded our cruise ship. Hotel staff was very helpful with recommendations for dining as well as arranging a taxi for us. If I ever find myself in Puerto Rico again, I will definitely stay here again without hesitation.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Value Stayed at Corel Princess for an extended weekend. The reviews are true, the hotel was wonderful. Rooms were clean, and the marble floors were a good touch. The advertised Jacuzzi in the rooms are a bit misleading...basically its a standard size bathtub with waterjets (made by Jacuzzi Inc.). Room was adequately sized, and staff was friendly. Refrigerator in room, remote control A/C, English  Spanish cable TV, 24hr Wallgreens around the corner, convenient to all highways all for $99/nt. The hotel only has 4 free parking spots in front, but they have discount parking available ($8/day) at a neighboring hotel. Highly Recommended, AAA+++

<Content>Great little place I booked a 4 night stay at the Coral Princess based on the reviews I had read on this website. The hotel was absolutely adorable, the rooms were comfortable and spotless. The staff was very professional and very friendly, and the hotel is situated 2 blocks from the beach and around the corner from a strip of some great restaurants and bars. Breakfast was so-so, and there was a slight musty smell in the room, but all-in-all I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for something affordable in San Juan. For food, I recommend Hermes Oyster Bar - by far the best Mojitos I've ever had (the bartender would not divulge his secret ingredient) - which was about a block from the hotel. La Dorada, which was right around the corner, also had some great Puerto Rican/seafood fare, and came highly recommended by most of the locals. Enjoy!

<Content>Wouldn't stay anywhere else in San Juan! Stayed here on business in mid-June 2004. If you are going to visit San Juan you would be cheating yourself if you stay at a big hotel. The Coral Princess Inn allows you to get the native feel of San Juan. The property has been incredibly renovated. The rooms are a decent size (at least mine was), with a refrigerator. The new air conditioners work like a charm! Althought the pool is some what small, the beach is only 2 blocks away. There is a hot tub up on the 3rd floor as well as a pool table and a full kitchen. Surrounded by all kinds of good places to eat. The continential breakfast was very good. Best of all the staff was very friendly and helpful. All the amentities of a big resort, but the piece and quiet of a private cottage. Only problem is parking. They only have 4 spots in front of the hotel. We always were able to get one of the 4, but if not you only have to walk a minute to a parking lot the hotel has a contract with. If you stay here you won't be disspointed.

<Content>Condado's best kept secret! What a find! This is a boutique style inn with lots and lots of charm! They have one of the most beautiful courtyards I have ever seen, lush plants are everywhere you look! The Inn has a wonderful open air feel to it. Beautiful and original paintings are in every room of this Inn, which gave it a very unique feel. My room was a nice size, with beautiful modern feel furniture. There was marble floors and really high ceilings, which gave the room a very upscale feel. The room had a jacuzzi tub and a fridge.I also loved the hot tub on the third floor! I have to say the staff was incredibly accomodating and laid back. We were told the Inn was sold out when we stayed there, but you hardley ever saw anyone!If you want a quiet Inn with lots of charm and great service, then stay here! P.S. The beach was a two minute walk!! :)

<Content>A fabulous find I discovered The Coral Princess through tripadvisor.com. The recommendations are absolutely correct. This was a lovely hotel in the Condado area. We stayed for one night following a cruise and were upgraded to a penthouse because the hotel was not full. This room was incredible! It was spacious with amenities including a jacuzzi tub and weight bench in the room and a private balcony (shared only by the three penthouse rooms) with a hot tub. In addition to this spacious room, the staff amazed us with their willingness to satisfy their guests. We wanted to head to El Yunque. When the front desk was unable to procure a tour, the manager (Luis?) called a friend at a car rental agency. A van immediately picked us up at the front door and brought us to a local car rental company. More astounding was what we discovered at El Yunque. While heading back to our car, we saw the hotel manager. He explained that another couple wanted to see the rain forest and were not able to drive a car. So-he brought them there on a private tour with a one hour drive each way. What incredible service!!!! I strongly recommend this hotel in San Juan!

<Content>Had a great stay! My husband and I stayed at the Coral Princess for ten nights in february, 2004. This was our first visit to Puerto Rico, so we were unccertain of what to expect. The Coral Princess was a delightful place to stay! It was a quiet oasis in the middle of a very busy area. We enjoyed the nearby convenience of wonderful local restaurants, a beautiful beach, and nighttime entertainment. We took the local bus into Old San Juan several times - it was an easy way to travel, since we did not rent a car during our stay there.The staff was very friendly and helpful. They booked some excursions for us - even made travel arrangements for us to take the ferry over to the Island of Vieques.My only complaint was that the room was very small. We booked one of their higher priced rooms, expecting much more space. There was no view to speak of from our window. However, the public areas of the inn were very quaint and attractive, so we made good use of these facilities. I would return there again.

<Content>Good Value We stayed at this hotel prior to our trip to the BVI's and upon returning. We felt the hotel was a good choice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They booked us a table twice at a marvelous restaurant, Miro-Marisqueria Catala, 74 Ave Condado. This restaurant was enough to make the whole trip worthwhile.Our room was coloful and clean. We had a outside sitting area. i agree that the included breakfast was adequate, but not great. I would have no reservations about returning to the Coral Princess Inn.

<Content>Little Piece of Paradise We stayed at the Coral Princess Inn from April 7th to April 13th. It's a little piece of paradise centrally located right amongst the hustle and bustle of the Condado area. The Inn is very well maintained and the live-in management ensured that everything was running smoothly. The entire property was spotlessly clean. We enjoyed the continental breakfast each morning and had the little pool and rooftop hot tub to ourselves every time we used them. Our Executive room with a queen bed was located in a building at the rear of the Inn and it was quiet and private. We had a jacuzzi tub, small frig, and a microwave. It was unfortunate that there was some noisy street excavation going on in front of the Inn, but I guess that is an unpreventable thing that can occur no matter where you stay. There is limited parking on the Inn property, but when that was not available we always got lucky and found a spot nearby on the street for our rental car. The Inn is within easy walking distance to the beach, casinos, and restaurants. The neighborhood appeared safe. We will definitely return to the Coral Princess Inn.

<Content>Perfect small retreat within Condado We live in the Virgin Islands and travel to Puerto Rico once or twice a year to get off the rock. We have been looking for a unique, friendly small establishment to stay in as an alternative to the corporate hotels. Boy, did we find it. The rooms were clean and modern - ours had a nice big jacuzzi tub. The outside spaces in the hotel are tiled in Mexican Saltillo tile and filled with palms, bougainvillea, and many varieties of orchids that some enterprising green thumb has gone to great lengths to cultivate. We very much enjoyed the sun deck on the roof with the jacuzzi - it was the perfect place to escape the hustle bustle of Condado and read a book. Someone has clearly gone to great lengths to create the kind of place they would want to stay - from the full-size modern kitchen and pool table on the third floor to the reading room with chess table on the ground floor, a lot of love has gone into this little place. We will definitely be back.

<Content>Relief! Just got back from a week long trip to Puerto Rico (4/4/2004), and stayed at the Coral Princess for 2 nights right before we left to come back home. Wish that I would have stayed at the Coral Princess for longer! It is a small 20-some room inn in the Condado area, about a 10-15 minute ride from the airport. It has a small swimming pool and a rooftop hot tub, but the beach is only a two block walk (an easy one). The continental breakfast was decent, enough to get you going in the morning, but could be improved. The hotel/room was very clean, and I felt safe there. There is a 24 hour Walgreens right around the corner, and many restaurants (both fast food and sit-down restaurants) and shops in within walking distance. The bus to Old San Juan is a block away and only costs 25 cents compared to taking a taxi for $10. There are some of the big hotels a block away if you want to go to the casino or partake in some of their entertainment. The staff is very friendly at the Coral Princess and very informative as well. I highly recommend you stay here if you want to save a lot of money.
