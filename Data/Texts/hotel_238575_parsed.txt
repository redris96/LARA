<Content>Great hotel! We really enjoyed our stay at the Clemens Hotel. The room was great. Very clean and quaint. We had a private room with a shower and toilet. Excellent location with a great balcony view - within walking distance of most of the big tourist activities. Friendly staff. I would definitely come back!

<Content>Do not stay at Clemens I think this hotel may have recently changed ownership because their website seems to be written by a woman named Dee. Our very negative experience with the Clemens Hotel was with a male owner who refused to tell us his name when I asked! We booked this hotel for 2 nights after the review in the Rough Guide called it excellent. I would say this is not at all the case anymore. We had some problems with the room and tried to talk to this man who said he was the owner and he was incredibly rude, unhelpful, and disrespectful to us. Alarmed by his reaction to our request for a change of room, we asked to get our money back for the second night of our stay, which he promptly refused. In a second incident, on the last morning we were there we had another terribly unpleasant encounter with this same man. The hotel's website says all over the place that breakfast is served until 10:30. We came downstairs at 10:15 and he said breakfast ended at 10 and he refused to even give us a cup for the coffee machine that was still sitting out. He sarcastically asked if we thought that he was supposed to come up and wake us up in time for breakfast. When we said we would just check out then he followed us to the door shaking his keys at us in an extremely bizarre manner. His behavior seemed very threatening and perhaps mentally unstable. I can see no other explanation for a hotel owner to treat customers in this way. I would strongly NOT recommend the Clemens Hotel.

<Content>Great for Queen's Day When we booked, we didn't know anything about Queen's Day. We were there the day before Queen's Day until the day after Remembrance of the Dead (like Memorial Day in the U.S.) We were so close to all the action. The night before Queen's Day there is lots of partying, and it seemed especially gregarious by the Homomonument, which is quite close to the Hotel Clemens and the Anne Frank house. Our room, #7, was on the top floor overlooking the main street. The room was quite small, but clean. The bathroom was clean. We had no problem with anything going missing. The main staff member, a young man, was very helpful, and took our bags from the front door up the 37 stairs to reception. He may even have taken them up the next two flights to our floor. I just can't remember now. We were told when we made the reservation that they wanted full payment in cash (Euros) upon checking in. The stairs are not very wide so if you have any balance problem or vertigo, this is not the place for you. In fact, most of the old hotels are like that. We rented the laptop, and it worked nicely, with their wireless internet. We would stay there again.

<Content>Such a cute room I came from Paris to Amsterdam for a few days. It meant a lot to me to be in a hotel where I would feel very comfortable, kind of like 'at home', and to be in a very central location. My budget on that trip being somewhat tight, I chose hotel Clemens after browsing several hotel websites on the net. Well I was not disapointed. I got the room I asked for, which turned out to be exactly like on the web (it's not always the case): small,but who cares? I spent most of my time outdoor; actually, I thought it added some charm to it. Very quiet (room on the back, not overlooking the main street), very clean. The staff was very friendly. I appreciated being able to have a cup of tea or coffee any time. As for the steep stairs, to me it's part of these old Dutch houses. This is A'dam! If people are turned off by those stairs, they must then travel in standard hotels which offers the same rooms all over the world! This is not my idea of travelling...

<Content>Perfect location I booked this hotel as a 2nd choice after reading my first choice had many complaints about too many stairs. Am I glad I 'took 2nd place'! The location could not be better - between Westermarkt  the Dam. Most important, the hotel's immaculately kept - every part. One other person/room shared the shower  toilet but I never even ran into anyone on my floor, let alone had to wait to use the facilities. My Single was tiny but very comfortable and very quiet (on a courtyard - the other single has a balcony, but I wanted quiet). Wonderful windows. Yes there are lots of stairs - 37 to the front desk. I had 26 more to my floor; more for the other floor. The breakfast's nothing much, but the rates are low and the staff is most accommodating. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Even my girlfriend was satisfied I booked the hotel before my girlfriend read the reviews on here. (I didn't know of the site). Some reviews have been very critical but we both thought the hotel was lovely. Good room (double deluxe), friendly reception and ample breakfast.The stairs are definitely breath taking! Great location close to Dam Square  lots of bars  restaurants.

<Content>NO! NO! NO! I really wished I had read these reviews BEFORE I booked with the clemens hotel!Like previous reviewers have said it looks at least on its website like a great place to stay - not cheap - but centrally located and friendly, looks can be deceiving!The rooms here are incredably small. OK we booked in a budget room (this basically meant shared bathroom), but got outsize coffin. And the room wasnt even cheap, I dont think 75 euro is good value and we have travelled all over europe.The shared shower and toilet are also VERY small, sitting on the toilet I struggled to close the door as my knees were in the way. The shower room you step straight in to the shower basin from the corridor so have to dress and undress stood in the shower.The staff to be fair WERE (see later) nice and friendly and spoke english and offered directions. The breakfast (had to pay more!) was a bit lacking and could get a lot more quantity and quality nearby.Hotel was very central, 5 mins from dam square and near tourist attractions such as cathedral and anne frank house and pretty canals.All would of been fine but for second to last night - THEFT! we returned to room and found things missing. Nothing of dramatic value but stuff that could of easily not have been missed or you would think you had lost it. But I knew that things were in certain places when I left the room on the morning and they were not there on the evening.We informed the management who in time became very unfriendly and basically accused us of lying. I am not a lier, I am a registered nurse, I am an angel! The cleaner (obviously main suspect) gave me evil looks. We made a police report and eventually they refunded cost of stolen items but didnt admit anything and held to the idea that we had lost things. Not that easy to lose things in a room about 8 foot by 6 foot! Basically DO NOT stay there, you will not find cheap accommodation in amsterdam, its a place you need to spend more and youll enjoy it, its a beautiful place.

<Content>Good, but noisy To begin with, the steps up are very very steep and narrow, and a lot of them ( 37 to the reception, and another 20 to the first floor ! ), so you better be travelling light. The room was pretty good, and clean. The view out of the room ( no. 3 ) was great, right on the main road looking out to the palace. But that also meant it was extremely noisy, pretty much all through the day and night. So light sleepers, beware. And the bathroom had the wierdest shower ever. No shower head, just a spout from which water dribbled down. Not a very pleasant bathing experience. The breakfast was the normal European fare, and the management pretty knowledgable about the city and helpful. And the location is great, maybe a 10 minute walk from Dam Square.But for me, the noise, and the steps were enough to put me off another stay here. I would look for another place as and when I do come back to Amsterdam And I loved the city and would certainly love to go back.

<Content>Crime Scene Investigation Who slept on this bed last night?, I asked myself as I decided to open my bed. I found hair on the pillows and decided to send it to trace. By the shape on the sheets, it was clear to see that the last victims were also a couple. That was when we decided to run away. All hotels were fully booked, so we had to spend here one mistery night. Who made these holes on the bed cover? Who tampered with the shower? And finally: who hate all of the bloody croissants in the morning? These questions are still unanswered... maybe for the best.The Clemens seemed a nice place to stay. The pictures showed cosy rooms. But the stains are invisible on the nice photos. Watch out, people... Other crimes may occur. Be afraid... be very afraid...

<Content>"Clememcy", Please! (Too Bad To Qualify...) Me  my girlfriend arrived in Amsterdam for what was going be a whole week stay, so we made a 7-night reservation at the Clemens Hotel. We started searching for a place to stay about 10 weeks in advance, just to assure we could choose among a broad range of possibilities. Clemens seemed a very good choice at first sight - although not cheap at all, looked like a good value for the money, either by its funny website, nice pictures and overall good reviewer comments.After a very early - although not long - flight, we're expecting to take a nap before starting to explore the city. Right after (literally) climbing the stairs with the our heavy travel bags, we got dramatically disappointed with the deluxe double room we had awaiting for us (room nr. 3, as long as I can recall): dusty, smelly (an horrible mixture of cigars and must), with stained carpets and a ragged bed cover. When we (hesitantly) opened the bed, we noticed the sheets hadn't been changed as they were filthy and the pillows had the previous guests' head moulds.After requesting for our sheets to be changed at the reception, we went out looking for other place to stay, which we luckily found.In the end, we only had to sleep at the Clemens Hotel for 1 night, then we left - I don't believe what would be to spend a whole week there. About the WC incidents, involving the shower integrity, I'd rather not even to speak of it... I think this should be enough to justify why I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE.

<Content>YUCK! went there with 5 friends other friends, 3 to a room, when i walked into room 2, put the lights on there were 4 flys spinning around... then i opened the bathroom door only to be greeted by this terrible smell, i asked the lady for fly spray  some freshen for the bathroom.. i asked her to go into the bathroom to check the smell but she refused to  said we should be okay if left open for 5 mins  we'd get use to the smell. the bed covers were stained  the safe did not work. its was nothing like it said it was on the website, when we booked we were told breakfast was included... but when we got there... no breakfast... we paid 300 euros for both rooms, we could have easily got a 4 star hotel for that price... also there was a horrible cat chasing mice all night... shall i start about the stairs.... take your own stair master!!!!! i would never go back there, its been 3 days since getting back  i have bites  have been itching since... i blame my friend porkie as he is use to living in a pig sty. the only good thing about the hotel was the dutch milk/cream you get in reception area...

<Content>Claustrophobic I would not recommend this hotel. There are many other options in Amsterdam for $10 more than are far superior (we stayed in one of them - The Waterfront). Claustrophobic is the word I would use to describe this narrow row house - 73 steep stairs to our room which was tiny and unattractive. Breakfast is not included; if you add in breakfast for 2 ($14), it brings this hotel into the same price range as other much more desirable accomodations.

<Content>Typically Dutch Clemens Just got back from a three night stay at the Clemens which was very enjoyable. Yes the stairs do come as a shock at first even when you have read about them beforehand but there must be thousands of properties like this in holland. I find it's best to 'go with the flow' when you go to a foreign country.Enjoy the difference. If you want a lift, go to a concrete and glass hotel! We were on the top floor, room 7 with balcony and no proper wardrobe. Got to say I didn't see any cig butts, the place was spotless, clean towels every day and the staff were really friendly. Can't comment on the breakfast as my husband doesn't 'do' it so went to Jennifers over the road for croissants instead. Clemens is in a very good spot and we enjoyed it very much.

<Content>Would I recommend the Clemens? After reading so many positive comments about this hotel we decided to give it a go for a short, 2 night break. Am I glad that it was only two nights! When you open the front door you are confronted with a monumental flight of stairs that are so steep a ladder would have been easier to climb in comparison. There is no reception area to speak of, just a wooden desk with a computer and phone. Our room, no 7, was toted as being the best in the hotel having a balcony. It was two further flights of stairs up and was dark and dingy. The antique furniture consisted of a battered old table and the balcony doors blew open several times during the night, the balcony itself being covered with old cigarette butts. There wasn't even a wardrobe to hang our clothes. On the plus points the sheets on the bed were clean as was the bathroom although we were pleased not to have to share the inadequate showers and toilet facilities that the other guests had to endure. The staff were curteous. The breakfast was average but not worth the 鈧? charged per person. The location was very convenient to all attractions, within walking distance of many. It was also very expensive for a budget hotel, we've paid less for 5 star accomodation in New York! Would we stay there again? Not for all the tea in China. Only to be stayed in as a last resort but useful if you are in training to climb Everest.

<Content>Our stay was great. The hotel is about 10 mins walk from central station (two minutes from Dam square) just behind Dam square, so it's very convienient. Our deluxe room was comfortable and adequate, the breakfast bar had a good choice of food and drink (the coffee is instant but good quality and there is a very good choice of teas). Once a week you can hear carrilion concerts from the Westerkerk close by. A couple of rooms have a balcony and they are worth trying to get. We found all the staff friendly and they quickly responded to our modest requests. a light bulb went out in the shower and was replaced as soon as we reported it.

<Content>Great Location! We stayed here for 3 days and would recommend the hotel. The staff was very helpful and nice and made you feel welcome. The hotel is very close to the Anne Frank house (a must see) and the canals. A local market is a couple of blocks down and restaurants are everywhere. Within walking distance of the Square and, if you want, the Red Light District is about a 20 minute walk away. The tram stop is down the street, but, the train station is within walking distance. The deluxe rooms are nice (but small) and have private showers and toilets. However, the budget rooms are nice also. Beware of the VERY steep stairs. All in all, we would stay here again.

<Content>Just OK The location is excellent and the staff is very helpful and friendly. The rooms are small. Our balcony room had a safe in the closet that made it impossible to hang a coat. However, since one spends little time in the room when one has a city like Amsterdam to explore, it was adequate. The breakfast is not worth 7 Euros. A short walk gives you several choices for better choices with outdoor seating on a canal. No major complaints, but we'll make another choice for a return visit.

<Content>Clemens Hotel: "Friendly and Great Value!" Just returned from a week at the Clemens Hotel. Dee and her staff made our first trip to Europe very enjoyable. From the moment we arrived we were treated very well. When Dee learned that one of us was celebrating a birthday she sent out for fresh cut flowers. Dee knows everything about the city and was very helpful in making dinner reservations for us and suggesting sights to see. Our room was fabulous, on a courtyard with a flowering tree right outside the window. The location is perfect, midway between Dam Square and Anne Fruankhuis. We will definitely stay at this hotel again in the future!

<Content>Clemens is just 'okay' I booked this hotel based on the overwhelming positive reviews found here. Although I wouldn't go as far as saying 'Don't stay here' as the previous person did, I was a little disappointed. The bed was hard and uncomfortable, the pillows were very lumpy and it did not appear that any vacuuming was done while we were there. The bathroom was clean and we did get clean towels each day but the shower head was taped into a strange position. Also, the street noise was quite bad and no one mentioned this (or I would have asked about a garden room). Our experience with the staff was positive. No complaints there.If you are on a budget, this hotel is OK and in a good location. If you've got a bit more money, I'd stay somewhere else.

They didn't clean the toilet or much else in the room on any day. Deluxe room was very basic. Lumpy bed with hard pillows. You have been warned !

A walk down the street takes you to Dam Square and then on to the Red Light District which is a must see. If interested a visit to the famous coffee shops for your wacke bacce or a piece of cake with your coffee. A place where my wife and i hope to return to again.

<Content>A totally delightful hotel in Amsterdam I have used the Clemens twice so far on layovers enroute to India on Business and been totally delighted. Very high speed Internet connection is provided in all rooms for free -- in fact, I was able to remote access my PC in the US and watch local TV in the US through the link.If you forgot your PC, they have portables available. Although Rick Steve's have not discovered this hotel, he should. Within 30 minutes of collecting my luggage at Amsterdam airport, I am dropping my bags off at the hotel (using public transit only!) and ready to enjoy Amsterdam, Dee was extremely helpful in planning my day when I needed assistance.Excellent (not the heavy UK style) breakfast buffet with a small but very friendly/almost family staff. Although not a BB, it approaches it BUT with extreme closeness to Anne Frank's House, the West Church and the downtown area. One very unusual item is the old fashion dutch style of cleaniness. There is no masking of smells with scents or airfreshners -- and the hotel appears to be a very friendly place for those suffering from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity or allergies. Lots of good ethnic resturants within 2 blocks.Being a small established, located in a heritage building that is around 150 yrs old - you can get the feel of yesteryear. For example, no fitness center -- but you will keep fit with the built in step-machine known as old Amsterdam stair cases. No elevator - so not for the handicap.The entire hotel appear to be have been completely renovated in the last 2-3 years, so everything is perfect with no wear and tear.I'm looking forward to continued layovers in Amsterdam at the Clemens for the many more business trips that I expect this year. It has been perfect for my needs. I am exploring cities in Amsterdam from here (den Haage, Delft, Haarlem) since the train station is approx a 8 minute walk away -- so after breakfast, I can go exploring and be in another city by 10am and then return in the evening to my base of operations.It is one H*ll of a pleasant experience -- totally exceeded my expection.Ken (semi-retired Microsoftee)

<Content>The "friendly" Clemens Hotel This was the friendliest hotel I have ever seen!! I had my purse and backback stolen on way to the hotel the very first time and this lovely lady loaned me money for dinner and a passport pictures - I was a total stranger to her!!! I loved the friendly talks, bits of local advice and freshly brewed tea. One night there were even some local Dutch candies left for me in the room. How sweet!Great location for walking or catching the bus. I would love to stay there again.

We got the greatest room on the topfloor, one of the deluxe rooms, and deluxe it was! They call themselves a budget hotel, but we discovered nothing budget! There was a tv, internet( even laptops!), hairdryer, a romantic balcony with great view, a safebox..we got free tea at the reception all the time and the breakfast was awesome!

<Content>Amazing value for money Last April took my 2 teenage daughters to AMsterdam  stayed at the Clemens Hotel.The owner Dee was most helpfull with advice on unusual outings for us, in particular the picnic she helped us plan in the countryside, (we rented bicycles  took the train to Zaandijk) was the highlight of our trip! The rooms are spacious, offering all amenities, we were also able to rent a laptop from reception...thus saving on telephone calls home. Would highly recommend this hotel, we felt very safe (3 females travelling alone)indeed, we felt very much at home. the breakfast balcony is a great relaxing venue at the end of a long day!
