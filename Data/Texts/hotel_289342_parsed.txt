<Content>Very enjoyable Just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel, which was clean, room basic (double bed, desk unit, leather chair, tall unit for TV, coffee machine and fridge) but comfortable although on the small side. Bathroom, good size, very clean and stocked with toiletries, daily towel change, efficient room aircon (33 deg outside during the day). Breakfast was adequate for a 2 star, variety of breads, rolls, cheese, cold meats, yougart, pastries, etc. The breakfast room in Basement was a bit claustrophobic. Fantastic hotel location, metro right outside and 5 min walk down to the bustling La Ramblas. Thought the many Tapas bars along La Ramblas to be 'rip offs' and better to seek out eateries in the side streets and narrow alleys. Most tourist sites easy walking distance, public toilets exist but you need to hunt them out!!! Port Vell leisure island is good for harbour side restaurants, 'The Wok' was excellent, the beach front also has frequent toilets and good bars/restaurants, 'Sol Cafe' was also excellent value. The Aerobus from airport was ideal, terminates at Place Da Catalunya, less than 5 mins to hotel, fare now Euro 4.05. and run every 6 mins. The only 'downside' of a city centre hotel is the traffic noise which disturbed the sleep but other than that .............would recommend the hotel and Barcelona which has a great atmosphere.

<Content>Excellent location, helpful staff I spent 3 nights at the City Park Pelayo Hotel with a friend just a week ago. The location is the best: the underground stop Universitat was just under our window. Moreover, we could have easily walked to Placa de Catalunya, which was just one underground stop away. The street was very quiet and we had no trouble whatsoever in going back to the hotel at night.My friend and I had a double ensuite room on the 4th floor. It was a nice room, not enormous but comfortable enough for two people. The only thing missing was a desk or small table, but then we didn't need it. The bathroom was spacious, quite big actually. The air conditioning, which I guess must be very useful in Barcelona during the summer, was working very well. There were also a fridge, a tv and a coffee machine (we never used this). Everything was clean and functional. Everyday new towels were provided, even if not asked for. Breakfast was not included in the room fare, but it was always available in the morning in the breakfast hall for a little extra. It was a buffet, nothing special but enough to fill you in.The hotel staff were kind and helpful. On the last day they let us keep our luggage in a locked room after we checked out.To sum up, the hotel is good, the location excellent. I think we got what we paid for.

<Content>Stay somewhere else This hotel is not a good value for the money. We've stayed in May 2008 and paid a wooping 140 Euro for this very basic hotel without breakfast. Tiny room stipped down to the bare bones: two twin beds pushed together, no table, dirty old chair in the corner and an aircon that is tuned off at night (when you need it the most). Dirty carpet, no pictures on the walls, the room is the size of the bed - no place to put two suitcases. Just depressing. Reseption staff varies. None speak good English, but some are friendlier than others. If you are on a romantic trip to Barca, try finding something nicer.

<Content>great location the location of this hotel is excellent. the room we had was very small and the bed was so hard it was difficult to sleep. although the room was very clean and done every day, the coridoor carpets were very stained and shabby. the room was very warm and the windows didn,t open, also the air condition wasn,t working. breakfzxt was included in our price but the dreary room in the basement where breakfast was served would put you of. also it was not worth getting up for. all in all, not a hotel i would ever return to i,m afraid.

<Content>Fantastic value for money! Great location for visiting all the sites in Barcelona. The Metro is right outside the hotel, + La Rambla is only a 3-5 min walk away!Had a great room overlooking the square, the room itself was basic but had a spacious (clean) bathroom. The breakfast was good, toast, friut, cakes, meat and various drinks.The staff were pleasent and could speak good english. Would recommend to anyone doing a short city break. Would return again!

<Content>beds are hard!! don't stay here unless you like really FIRM beds. Seriously firm. location is great. like 100 ft to universidad metro. did have some modern conveniences and a fridge. breakfast is good -- european w/bread, meats, cheeses, etc. also, hotel is not on the corner as is pictured on many sites. they do not have wireless internet either. bar d'or is a great place that is across street and on a corner. order the tapas sampler and you'll be glad you did. back to the hotel, there was a young guy at the front desk (w/red tie) that gave us BAD info on the hours of stores and best ways to get around, so don't bother asking them. just go to the TI (tourist info) at the Placa Catalunya just down the street at the top of the Rambla. there is also a great restaurant -- Santa Anna -- on the street w/the same name that is off the Rambla.

<Content>Brilliant! Best location you could ask for! This hotel is at the top of La Rambla , right next to Universidad metro stop and a few minutes from Catalunya metro stop. It's less than a minute to La Rambla and althoguh it's on a busy street, it's not a problem. A recurring theme seems to be the TV and coffee machines being out of order, maybe they never worked! But it would be better to remove them from the room completely if this is the case. The hotel is very clean, modern and has a top breakfast down in the basement! We loved our stay here, the room and hotel overall were quite small but not inconveniently so. I would defeinitely recommend, and I can't believe what great value for money this is. Also....we arrived late and wanted to find somewhere for dinner near by and that were still serving! One of the first buildings on La Rambla that you'll come to is a cafe downstairs but just above is Bacco (you'll see the name on the window, it's next to Burger King unfortunately!). It was really cheap, lovely food (starters were stunning, main course nice but nothing fancy). And we had a view over La Rambla and Place de Catalunya.

<Content>Had everything we needed! Fab little hotel. Got back this morning from a short stay in this fab little hotel. Highly recommended. Can't understand why it's classed as a 2star - I've not long come back from a 4star in Rome, which wasn't any different! Room was slightly on the small side, but that's not really a negative, as it had everything we needed. Room was exceptionally clean. Clean bed sheets and crisp white towels, which is what you would expect anyway but after reading reviews of other hotels around La Ramblas - you never know!! Slept through the night - no problems with noise. Mini bar / fridge in room - apparently the refreshments are free - they didn't charge us for the water we took. There is a coffee machine in the room, but even my clever techno sister couldn't work it out! Continental breakfast. A little basic, but very filling. The usual, bread, toast, cakes, (try the pain au chocolate - yummy) fruit, cereals, tea coffee fruitjuice etc.etc. ALL Staff were very friendly and helpful. Excellent locatation. Very close to La Ramblas - less than a five minute walk - in a straight line, so no way of getting lost!! Lots of very nice clothes shops all around the hotel, so get ready to spend some money. Just behind the hotel is Bus Stop No.1 of the open top hop on/off bus. This will take you to all the sights around Barcelona. it cost 20euros for one day, or 24 euros for a two day ticket. Well worth the money if you want to try and fit everything in in a short space of time. We just managed most of the sights in two days. If you're looking for somewhere nice to eat, try The Attic Restaurant near the centre of La Ramblas. V.nice restaurant. Bill for 4 of us came to 100euros (拢70) for 4 three course meals, which included a bottle of one of their dearer wines. Couldn't understand why it was so cheap there as the food was fab. (Tho, Make sure you ask for your starter to come separately to your main, or they'll bring it all out together)!!!!I travel a lot, and always research my hotels before I go - this hotel is definitely value for money. No complaints from me.

<Content>Absolutely Recommended We would recommend this hotel on all counts. The location is superb, on Placa Universidad a couple of minutes walk from Rambla  Placa Catalunya. Our room was great - we had a double bed (a little hard but we were so tired after walking all day we hardly noticed that), safe(no extra charge), desk  chair, fridge, TV, coffee maker (but no coffee!), bathroom with bath  shower, WC, sink, bidet, hairdryer  complimentary toiletries. We were on the fifth floor  had no problem with noise from within the hotel or outside. Everywhere in hotel extremely clean  well cared for. Continental breakfast in the basement dining room was good  plenty of it. All staff, especially reception, were really friendly  helpful. We were able to leave our cases locked in office all day on day of departure. Will definitely return to Barcelona  to this hotel.

<Content>Terrific Great location. 2 mins from Universitat metro station (buy 10 journey targete to use on metro or bus) and 5-10 mins walk from Plaza Catalunya - the centre of everything. No 24 bus (cross road and round corner) will take you out to the Park Guell, which is well worth a visit.I booked at last minute via Ratestogo - added 2 nights on to business trip - and had small double room on 4th floor, Room 402. Would have been bit of a squeeze for 2 people but OK for one. Expect that's why they gave it to me. Room was clean and in good condition. Water and soft drinks in free minibar. I couldn't get coffee maker to work, but that may have been down to me.Receptionists very friendly and helpful. I arrived quite a bit before earliest checkin but that wasn't a problem. I was given room at once. When I said I wished I had a small metro map instead of the one on the back of the large map, she cut one out of another map for me. The only lift was out of order on morning I was checking out. Receptionist suggested I leave packed bags in room and chambermaid would lock them away upstairs. I didn't hear any noise from other guests. Bit of traffic noise even with windows closed, but that is to be expected given the good lcoation. I was given window key at reception to open window during day.Hotel is run to higher standards than your average 2 star. There is a white coated housekeeper with clipboard who supervises cleaning and preparation of rooms.As others have said, breakfast is a bit basic, but there is plenty of food there if you want. Fresh melon on the second morning was a welcome addition.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to friends.

<Content>More than we expected! We were quite surprised upon arrival after having booked Citypark Hotel Pelayo, as we got it really cheap and didn't expect much from a 2 star superior hotel.The reception was small, but nice and clean, with very hellpful and friendly staff. There was a spacious elevator to take us up to the 2nd floor.The room was small, but very nice, we had separate beds and they had wheels, so we could move them away from each other. The room was nice and clean, but very warm, as they had put winter heating on. After one night we asked if it was possible to get A/C instead, but since it wasn't possible during winter time, they gave us a handle to open the window.The room was fitted with a large closet, sattelite tv, espresso coffee machine, safe and a mini bar with complimentary drinks.The bathroom was light and spacious with a big bath tub, bid茅, wc and faucet with a large mirror. Toiletries included were shower cap, shoe shiner, shampoo and shower gel. Towels were changed everyday.Included in the price was breakfast buffet, which was simple but good. It consisted of three types of bread, butter, ham, chorizo, cheese, different types of jam and honey. Cereals, youghurt, milk, water, three types of juice and fruit. And of course coffee and tea.The hotel has a great location in the centre, close to the Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas, the main street of Barcelona.All in all, this hotel really exceeded my expectations!

<Content>City Park Booked last minute and arrived late, had absolutely no problems checking in and finding the room.Got to the room and was surprised at the facilites, tea/coffee/fridge which i found particularly handy for keeping drinks etc.Bed was firm but very comfortable, the bathroom was great, very well fitted and modern.It was a clean and friendly hotel which is all you want when travelling, the point is you go on holidays to see the sights etc, not spend your holiday in your hotel....it was so good we have booked to stay there again this year and would recommend it to anyone and in fact have done so to a few work colleagues who have also stayed and would so again.

<Content>It's a 2 star hotel Hotel City Park Pelayo BarcelonaMy husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in late September/October. It fitted our criteria of A/C,fridge,non smoking and a safe in the room. We booked it through Expedia in July before we set off on a long trip and it was amongst the most expensive hotels we stayed in. 129.00 Euros room only. And the least value for money. The lobby is tiny, as is the lift. Needless to say so was the room. The bed was so small it can鈥檛 even have been a double. It was downright uncomfortable too. There was no night table by the window side, so we pushed the bed against the window wall to be able to move at all. We were falling over our bags as it was. The wardrobe was minute There was only room to hang up 2 jackets, and was really only the entry to the water downpipes. Every time someone upstairs had a shower or used the loo we knew about it.There was a stand at the end of the bed containing T.V. and an espresso machine, with 2 plastic disposable shot cups and 2 sachets of coffee. Minibar underneath no milk provided.The 1st day we returned in the middle of the day and were surprised that the coffee and cups were not replaced, neither were the towels. So we asked for, and got them assuming it was just sloppy housekeeping.The 2nd day towels replenished but no coffee. When my husband asked for it he was told that they only supply once. When he pointed out that we were paying the same rate every night he was given 2 sachets-we had bought our own milk already. It was just ridiculous the machine would only hold these little sachets; I鈥檝e no idea where one would buy them. We didn鈥檛 bother asking for new disposable cups-(they were never replaced) as we had our own basic travelling picnic gear and we felt it just wasn鈥檛 worth the hassle! We made sure we asked for-and got coffee our last night, ready for the morningThe bathroom was (naturally) tiny, and no toiletries supplied apart from soap.They have a breakfast room but we never ate there, plenty of other places nearby.On the plus side the position is very handy Calle Del Pelai corner of Ronda de la Universitat. Close to Placa de Catalunya square and La Rambla But it鈥檚 almost on a traffic island, so very noisy from that and our room had virtually no insulation.I always sleep in earplugs and my husband can sleep through anything,but it could be a big problem for other people.The A/C worked very well,and there was a safe amongst the down pipes of the wardrobe.No sign of smoking in the room.Fortunately we didn鈥檛 go to Barcelona to spend much time in the room.Apart from all the usual tourist things we had dinner at Los Caracoles, and I can thoroughly recommend it! The food wasn鈥檛 great but the experience was. We hadn鈥檛 booked but fortunately got there about 8.40pm and only had to wait 1 录 hours in the bar. By which time we had made several new friends and got rather sozzled.On the extreme downside, my husband had his pocket picked coming down from Parc Guel to the open top bus stop. We think it must have happened when we stepped back to let a couple pass us on the very narrow footpath. Don鈥檛 let your guard down for a second in Barcelona.

<Content>Very clean and excellent location We booked our hotel over internet with Hotels and when we arrived at the hotel (confirmation print-out in hand) they had no record of our booking. I would recommend doing it by phone.They were very helpful and thankfully they had a double room free and charged us the same amount the website had said we could have it for (75 euros per night).Our room was a good size, spotless and had a big bathroom with a bath. There's two free drinks in the mini-bar and a coffee machine.The staff were really friendly and polite and gave us maps with directions and recommended a great tapas bar for dinner.If you go by car the parking, which is just across the road, is 42 euros for 24 hours.The other plus for this place is the great location. The metro is easy to use and is just next to the hotel.

Positives:+ easy access from/to the airport+ close to Placa de Catalunya+ price was ok (around 93 euros through Destinia incl. breakfast)+ beautiful building+ quite spacious bathroom+ efficient air conditioningNegatives: - the room itself very smallI would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for basic, clean and modern accommodation in the heart of Barcelona. I would try to get a corner room in the tower, it could be nice.

<Content>A surprisingly great, cool hotel for 100 euros After finding that the Hotel Condestable looked like (in my friend's words) a methadone clinic with dank rooms, narrow hallways and plywood doors with holes in them, we quickly fled to this one around the corner. Despite having the same two-star rating, the rooms here were clean (though kinda small) but the bathrooms were large and the design had an Ian Schrager-esque look. The staff was very helpful, printing out directions and event info. It would have been nicer if breakfast went later that 10:30 or the large downstairs breakfast room was better lit, but the food was good. Sure it wasn't as nice as the Hotel Jazz next door, but it was much less expensive. The location for all of them was a bit commercial, but an easy walk to the Gothic district and right next to an equally cool area near the Universidad. Just across from the metro as well. Giving it an excellent rating because it was far better than the 100 euros for a double room or two-star rating would indicate. I'd recommend it to anyone - giving the website since it was so hard to find online: (--)

<Content>Perfect Location The location of this hotel couldn't be better. Its 2 minutes from Las Ramblas so close to all the major tourist attractions and metro lines. However, its also only 2 minutes from the Eixample and Gracia areas where there's some fantastic shopping and eating to be had, away from the majority of the tourist hustle and bustle. It is on a main road so has the potential to be a little noisy at night but it didn't really bother us.The rooms are very clean and well decorated, staff friendly and efficient and continental breakfast sufficient. Be warned the rooms can be quite small so if you are used to loads of space and living in the lap of luxury this may not be the hotel for you. However, for the budget traveler who wants a pleasent, central base for their trip this hotel is perfect and it would be difficult to find better for your money.Would definately stay here again and reccommend to friends.

<Content>super budget hotel Me and Hubby stayed at this hotel 24/11/05 for 2 nights. It's in an excellent location just a short walk down the road to La Ramblas and right outside is a metro station, so all the well known sights are in very easy reach. It's clean and smart. The people on the reception desk were friendly. Our room was smallish but plenty of room for us get around it. Our bathroom was very roomy, it had a massive shower cubicle with a great powerful shower and plenty of hot water. Our double bed was comfy. We were on the 3rd floor and looked out onto the street. You could just here the traffic but we slept soundly both nights. We got 3 free drinks a day in the mini fridge, shampoo etc and fresh towels every day.The breakfast was fine; juices, tea/coffee, cereal, yoghurt, fruit, ham, cheese, toast and pastries. In fact it was a bonus as when we booked we didn't realise it was included. and the best bit... it was very very reasonable at 50 euros a night for the room.

<Content>Decent, but small Stayed here for three nights from 18th May 2005. Everything was neat and tidy and staff very helpful. The room was possibly the smallest we have ever stayed in but it was not a big issue. However, some more space (ie drawers) to store clothes in would have been nice. The bed was also three quarter rather than a double. Maybe this is why it's two star as in all other respects it was as good as the three star we stayed in in Paris last year (and breakfast is included in the price which it wasn't in Paris).Location is excellent, being about five minutes walk away from Placa de Catalunya and La Rambla. There is also a Metro station (Universitat) about 70 metres away.This was our first visit to Barcelona and would thoroughly recommend La Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell, particularly the view from the hill with three crosses, (forgot the Spanish name!).Easiest way to get around is Metro (1.15 euros per journey or 6.30 for a 10 journey ticket). Bus Turistic is probably even better. There are two routes, North  South and tickets are 17 euros for one day or 21 euros for two. However, beware massive queues in Placa de Catalunya.

<Content>Fabulous location, perfect for first time in Barcelona! Chose this hotel based on the reviews found on this website. (10-13 November 2004) It is in an excellent location and has plenty of bars and shops nearby. Excellent bar just across the road too! Easy walking distance of Las Ramblas and Metro station nearby. The hotel is located between two very busy streets so there is some noise and I agree with a previous reviewer that the beds are hard! The room was clean and modern and the staff are very helpful. All in all a good place to stay for our first trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Excellent Value for Money Returned from 3 nights in Barcelona yesterday. Booked this hotel purely on the basis of reviews left on this website, and I have to say we were not disappointed. This is a great, no-fuss hotel. The reception is very efficient and friendly (if tiny), the rooms are beautifully clean and done out in a modern style - natural colours and chocolate leather chairs, and the bathrooms have quality 'Grohe' fittings. The location is excellent - 3 mins from Las Ramblas. We had requested a quiet room via email and were amazed to actually be given a quiet room! Breakfast in the contemporary, basement dining room was perfectly adequate - 6 euros per head. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Have stayed in 3 and 4* hotels (the 4* Grand in Copenhagen springs to mind!) which were not as good. Oh, and the building is beautiful - very baroque spanish. Great value for money!

<Content>Great deal! We spent one night at this hotel in May and were very impressed! We were just going to be in Barcelona for the day, so we needed something very centrally located. After reading the reviews on this website, we chose this hotel and we did not regret it. All the main attractions were of walking distance. The train station is literally in the corner. Las Ramblas is just 3 blocks away. The room was very clean, new and decorated in a modern fashion. We were a little concerned about noise, but found it to be reasonably quiet. The room included a small fridge (which we found to be helpful). The staff was also very helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel as a great short-term stay.

<Content>great buy in heart of the city Just stayed here (mid June, 04). Hotel is a great buy. You are walking distance to Las Ramblas, the Gothic Quarter, and the Olympic/port area. Was concerned about noise but not a problem and we were on only floor 2. Rooms small by American standards but immaculately clean. Only complaint was the hard beds but would definitely stay there again and recommend to others.

<Content>Great Location, great value OK, let's get the negatives out of the way to start with : The room we had, at least, was not the largest we've ever seen, and the breakfast, whilst adequate might disappoint those expecting a full-English cooked affair. We were also aware of a fair amount of traffic noise, though that didn't disturb our sleep too much.On the plus side, the hotel is excellently located at the top of La Rambla, giving good access to the old town and L'Eixample. We didn't take a Metro all weekend, and still took in most of the important landmarks on foot. Plus beying so close to the Placa Catalunya and the railway station there, it's a breeze to take the train to and from the Airport, and avoid the expense of a taxi.The room itself was extremely clean, well equipped and well-maintained, if a little spartan. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast times will suit early risers and those who prefer to sleep in alike.We really struck gold by choosing this hotel, and we'd not hesitate to return.

<Content>I would come here again! This hotel definitely seemed better than its 2 star label!Located in a nice area surrounded by shops and close to La Rambla, I was very impressed with the nice, clean and modern interior. The room was big and the staff were friendly and helpful!The buffet breakfast was also good with quite a wide selection to choose from.
