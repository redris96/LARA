<Content>Very Nice and Affordable The Hotel was very nice, large room with queen size beds, great for a family stay. It is only about 2 blocks from the beach. All types of things to do and see in the area that are within walking distance. Price was great. It is an older hotel but with great character and class. The staff was always helpful and cheerful. We had a wonderful time and would return for another stay.

<Content>Mostly good, some bad... We had no problem finding this hotel since it's in the middle of downtown Waikiki with our GPS. Without one, it would have definitely been a bit more difficult. Parking is terrible, they have a garage but you have to pay $20/day for it. The rooms are beautiful, the beds are very comfortable. That's always a problem I've had and if the bed isn't comfortable I'm not happy. It has high speed in your room if you've got a laptop for free which I liked and it was within walking distances of lots of restaurants and clubs plus the 100's of stores. The bad parts beside the parking is that the noise at night is bad. We were on the 14th floor and anywhere from 9pm until 5am you can hear everything. They do provide ear plugs in your room if it gets that bad you can use them.

<Content>Just OK Conveniently located in Waikiki. Can be very noisy at night! A bit outdated too. Overall, nothing special for what you pay. I guess I would try another hotel if I had to get back to Waikiki (which I guess is unlikely :-).

<Content>staff makes the wave After much agonizing and some so-so reviews we finally booked the Aqua Waikiki Wave for our New Year Holiday getaway, We arrived around noon and had to wait for check in for a couple of hours, and wondered if this might be an ominous warning for our whole stay. This was the last time we had a bit of discomfort. We were well taken care of during the check in process and kept informed by Treena until our room was ready. She never forgot we were waiting and checked in with housekeeping and gently pushed them along. Treena then gave our boys some candy and treats to thank us for our patience. She was very thoughtful and competent. Josh was also taking care of everyone during check in. During our stay he was constantly helpful and quickly became a favorite of our family. Josh deserves a 5-star rating as a great person. Lastly, whenever we needed some towels,etc, our housekeeping guy would immediately appear at our door with his wonderful smile and cheery demeanor. Any small imperfections of the hotel were blasted away by the stellar and caring staff. Yay ,Aqua for hiring these folks!

<Content>Great Value I stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave for two weeks in December '08. I had never been to Hawaii before, so wasn't sure what to expect - I was pleasantly surprised! For the amount of money I paid, I feel I received excellent value: the hotel was in a great location (just a block from prime beach area, near the Int.l Marketplace and Royal Hawaiian Mall); had clean, comfortable rooms that included a DVD player, microwave and fridge; and the staff was always ready to cater to my needs. I also have to rave about the complimentary toiletries: they smelled SO good (a tropical coconut/mango mix)! No bed bugs or strange smells were encountered, as other reviewers noted. But I will admit that noise was a problem...The hotel is next to several night clubs that are active most nights. Ladies of the Night also frequent Kuhio Avenue, as do drug dealers and other shady individuals. They usually come out after 11:00pm. Most nights, the action I witnessed sitting on my lanai was more interesting than anything on television. There are earplugs available in the room for light sleepers though. And there is a STRONG police presence. I generally felt safe, but I wouldn't recommend this hotel as a top choice for families. Some reviewers mentioned a free breakfast...I was never offered one (booked via Expedia), nor was there any information in my room as to where it was located. There was free wireless internet though. The signal was easy to pick up, but it was rather slow at times. Almost as slow as the elevators. But having said that, I would stay here again. It was a good base for a first-time visit to the islands.

<Content>Comfortable, but not in a good area I stayed at this hotel with my son and husband for five days. Our first night was Monday and we couldn't sleep due to the night club next door (Zanzabar). Tuesday and Wednesday was fine, just traffic noise. On Thursday ,however the prostitutes and night club promoters started working the streets. There are (2) night clubs on both sides of the hotel and (2) bars on the opposite side of the street. On Saturday and Sunday there were prostitutes all over the area. It's definitely not a family hotel.I wouldn't stay there again due to all the noise and street hasslers at night. Also in the Lobby there is a Chinese Restaurant which doesn't give a pleasant smell when you come in to the building.The beds were comfortable and we were please to have a refrigerator, microwave and dvd player. There were also red stains on the ceiling; not sure what that was about.Overall i wouldn't recommend this hotel for families.

<Content>Great budget hotel This hotel was pretty cheap and was a great find for the price. My room was comfy, the housekeeping service was excellent. There was a business centre I could use for internet and printing etc, a nice little gym and overall the staff were always very helpful and accomodating. I had no problems whatsoever with this hotel and would recommend it to anyone who does not mind the nightlife noise from the neighbouring properties - I can sleep through anything and in any event, this was not some romantic getaway.

<Content>Great Expectations Hi reviewers, my partner and I from North Carolina, now happily a blue state, are staying at the Aqua Waikiki Wave on the fifteenth floor. We have presently been at the hotel for two nights and are quite pleased. The maid, Florida from the Philippines, leaves the room fresh and clean every morning and provides us with regular and decaffeinated coffee for our morning awakening. She is a delightful and sweet little lady and very accommodating. You will also have access to the internet. If you don鈥檛 use the computer, there is always a morning paper outside your door when you awake. The beds in our room are comfortable and clean, a nice place to rest your head and dream about the next day鈥檚 activities. We luckily have five days left before returning to good old Durham.

<Content>Iffy I knew I was in trouble when I finally found the side alley way to the parking lot for this hotel. I was by myself and could find no place to leave my rental car while I checked into my room. I called the front desk and they advised me to double park in the basement garage, run in to register and then find some parking. In the couple of days I stayed here I could never find hotel parking in thier basement garage. Even if I had found a spot I might not have used it because these were the narrowest parking spaces I have ever seen. Expect major door dings here if using their garage. I had to park in a nearby pay structure that used a car elevator to park and then retrieve my car when ever I needed to go in or out. It made for a lot of wait time because many others used it too.The room itself was great. It was updated and nicely done in an asian zen-type theme. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. My view was of a parking structure. When ever my slider was open I heard only people in the streets, patrons from the nearby eating places, sirens, cars starting from the garage next door, busses and traffic. I stuck to using the A/C. This hotel sits on Kuhio Ave at the rear of the International Marketplace. If you are not in town on business and you don't plan to drive then this would by an ok place to stay if reserved at a very discounted price. I would not want to stay here on business again or a vacation.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This hotel was fantastic, it was clean and cleaned daily, the staff were fantastic, Josh at the front desk was great. The hotel is in the best location, close to everything and very well priced. After reading some reviews on this site about this hotel my friend and I were a little worried about staying there but all the negetive reviews proved to be wrong. The hotel in a major night club strip so yeah there maybe be a little noise at night but it wasn't anything to lose sleep over. Our room was right outside the elevators and we didn't hear people coming or going, the hotel is not as noisy as some people say, also some reviews complained about the bugs....What bugs??? there were none, we didn't even see any flies at all in Hawaii. If you read reviews on this hotel dont believe what people say about bugs, they must of brought the bugs with them. I could not pick a fault with the room it was fantastic, I guess the only thing that could be improved is the breakfast, but hey you get what you pay for. I am going back in October 09 and I will definitely stay at this hotel. Keep up the good work guys. Love ya!

<Content>Utilitarian accommodation stayed here for a week in late nov. while on vacay. i'm a 29 year old guy - maybe this helps with perspectivethe staff was very nice. room was clean, but not immaculate. view wasn't anything to write home about. no good onsite food, but you can always go out for that. rooms have a fridge, microwave, coffee perk - there's an ABC store and grocery store within a stones throw for snacks and such. you're only a block away from waikiki beach, and the hotel provides beach towels - a very awesome bonus the neighborhood was sketchy at night, but nothing that got out of hand. actually, night time was a surreal mix of tourists walking around with maps in their hands, and hookers doing their thang. just south of the hotel are the really expensive, really fancy hotels and stores like prada and burberry. at the end of the day i'd describe the neighborhood as eclectic. and yes, it could get loud outside at times. just remember the fact you're not staying at a country inn - you're staying in the heart of a cityultimately, it's a great hotel if you're on a budget. that's my 2 cents

<Content>Great price, great location, noisy at night I read reviews on tripadvisor and still couldn't decide where to stay, so I used priceline and the choice was made for me. I got an excellent price for this hotel in the middle of everything. When we arrived, I asked if we could upgrade to a room with a larger bed because my husband is tall. We got a great deal on an upgrade to a king suite. My husband and I go to Hawaii every year and usually stay a little closer to the beach but I really enjoyed the location of this hotel. The unfortuate part of being the in middle of the action is that it gets extremely noisy at night. The hotel provides ear plugs, but I don't like to wear them. The room had lots of space and was a little dated. The bed was pretty comfortable. If it wasn't so noisy, I would stay there again.

<Content>Greatly exceeded out expectations We had to book 1 night between 2 timeshare weeks in Honolulu and choose this place because of decent ratings, decent location, and a great price. We stayed here Friday, Nov 28. We were in a corner room on the 10th floor (1005 I think). Check in was fast  friendly. We were amazed at the room. It was HUGE and beautifully decorated. There were 2 beds, a king and a queen! The bed was extremely comfortable. We had a nice view of the mountains. We had no problem with noise (perhaps it was because we were on the 10th floor). Great bathroom with upscale vanity  fixtures. Everything was clean and well maintained - lobby, elevators, hallways, rooom, and bathrooms. I thought parking was a little pricey at $20 for the night, but that is my only complaint and I believe that paying for parking is the general rule when staying in Honolulu. We would stay here again in a heart beat.

<Content>Good Location, Great price, Stinky lobby!!!! Our stay at the Waikiki wave was very enjoyable, for starters the price of the room was 104 a night which is awesome for the area, considering the prices for the surrounding hotels, it was a 5 to 10 min walk to the beach and right on the bus lines, if your lazy it might be too far of a walk for you! The lobby however did stink like rank Chinese food, but it doesn't carry up to the rooms. I might have gotten bitten by a bed bud but I'm not quite sure . Room cleaning was spotty, they sometimes didn't re-stock towels or shampoo and left lots of trash. we were on the 15th floor and had a great view of the ocean and diamond head, you wont have a good view on the bottom floors but it's probably like that at all hotels. And it is true there is a hooker headquarters right next to the hotel but they're not visible till after 11 pm or so. If we had extra money to spend we might try something different but i would also definitely stay here again.

<Content>Awful Hotel with Bed bugs! Don't stay at this dirty, old place! This hotel is WAY overrated! No one should stay here! *I was bitten by bed bugs (which are very unattractive on anyone at the beach) *could not sleep until after 4 am when the night clubs closed (I can not stress how loud they are and I could not wear ear plugs while sleeping with my baby)*Woken up by police sirens every night (very loud, and I am not a light sleeper)*Not handicapped or stroller friendly. We had to carry our stroller up and down the stairs to get in to the building*Bathroom stunk and had mold in shower/sink*Front door closes at 10pm since there are hookers and pimps walking around in front (call the Big Kahuna restaurant on site if you don't believe me)*Adult sex shop across the street (not for families)*Breakfast was okay but only available for 2 hours*location to beach was more than just a block ( and dont forget the hookers!)*24 hour Jack in the Box across the street (for hungry hookers)*restaurants on site are no good*Room size was okay but a king bed is very limited*view was of a parking garage*free paper was nicePlease take this posting seriously! If you can stay somewhere nicer you should! My husband and I wanted to save money by staying here but it was really a mistake. If you want to stay here just rent gear and camp on the beach. We stayed for one week and will never stay again at this hotel. I wish I could post a picture of the ugly red welts the bed bugs left me on my legs. I would have recommended this place to young, party going people but who wants to be at the beach with bug bites? Now I must get back to sanitizing my luggage and belongings....

We were on the 12th floor and the view was great (we had a partial ocean view). The hotel staff is very friendly, accommodating, and helpful. It is located one block from the beach and within walking distance from the International Market and much more. We would stay again.

<Content>Not bad We stayed at the Aqua Wave only for a few hours. It wasn't bad but you can tell that it's an older building (especially in the bathroom). Also, it is right on the main street and just over a bar. They do provide you with earplugs though.The staff were very nice and helpful. They allow you to store your luggage if your flight leaves much later than the checkout.The business center is not all that great and is pay-per-use. It didn't look very efficient or tidy.Overall the stay was average.

<Content>Nice Place, Affordable and Convenient This hotel was nice, clean and affordable for Waikiki. Close proximity to beach, shopping and restaurants. Rooms had boutique feel in decor, which was refreshingly unique and not cookie cutter chain hotel. My room was on a lower floor, despite having booked a superior room, so it had limited views of the parking garage across the street, but a great balcony to enjoy coffee. There was some noise, but to be expected of this bustling area. The hotel even makes a bit of a joke of it and provides ear plugs for a restful night's sleep. The hotel makes beach towels available at the front desk. Pool is quite awkward located near restaurant exhaust fans and trash dumpsters. Stick to the beach. Microwave and fridge provided in room along with safe. Free wireless internet. Overall nice place and good value. Reviews on this site were pretty much dead on, so forgive me for sounding like a broken record.

<Content>Nice hotel, very reasonable price This hotel is a 2.5 to 3 star hotel. It is an older building but has been obviously upgraded - room interiors are very nice. Staff is very very friendly. It is two blocks from the beach - an easy walk. The price was wonderful - we paid $125/night in October 08 which is an amazing deal. It is located right overlooking the international market. Some of the other reviewers complained about the noise but we didn't find it too bad (we were on the 12th floor and with the AC running, it largely drowns out the noise). It is right on all the bus lines making transportation very easy. I will most definitely stay there next time we are in Honolulu because it is the perfect balance between a pretty nice place with a very reasonable price.

<Content>Excellent for the price This hotel is excellent for the money. Right in the heart of Waikiki in between the International Market Place. Noise wasn't a problem although if you are a light sleeper they even give you disposable earplugs...nice touch. They even surprised us with a bottle of champagne and macadamia chocolates. The room was updated and clean and the beds were sooo comfortable! The staff was also very accomodating. We have no complaints and though people complain about the continental breakfast...it isn't much to talk about but who cares for the money I am surprised they even offer it. Go next door to The Galaxy and get a big hot breakfast for 3.50 if you want a great breakfast. Well done Aqua Waikiki Wave.

<Content>Not As Impressed the Second Time I stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave in July with a large group of friends to attend a wedding. One close friend was unable to attend the wedding and planned a visit for November and I joined her. I still found the hotel to be clean, the rooms are a nice size, with mini fridge.  microwaves, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Josh, who is at the front desk during the day, is wonderful! Always friendly and super helpful.However, on my second stay, I saw signs of this hotel being more of a low budget/low class hotel, rather than a nice basic hotel at a reasonable price. The hotel promotes amenities such as: a Continental Breakfast - which is terrible. A Pool - that is the size of a large hot tub which is practically in the parking garage and is surrounded by cement walls and a few old lounge chairs, Really! The food, service and ambience at the Big Kahuna, the restaurant attached to the hotel, are poor. But what bothered me the most was the Prostitutes (Hookers) and the sleazy people they attract which are right outside the front door of the hotel. My girlfriend and I never felt unsafe coming and going from the hotel, not even at night, but I really don鈥檛 appreciate being exposed to that. The Aqua Waikiki Wave is not a bad hotel and it鈥檚 in a very convenient location, however, the next time I go to Waikiki I plan to look for a nicer place to stay. Aloha!

<Content>Excellent stay What a great vacation we had at the Aqua Wave. The room was clean, beds were great, and we had a partial view of Diamond Head and the ocean. To all the people that complain about the noise after reading all these reviews, I would tell them to get the hint and not stay on a lower floor. We were on the 15th floor and it was fine. Waikiki isnt the country, for crying out loud! But the location of this hotel was great. Right on the bus lines to anywhere you wanted to go. And we walked to the beach easily. If I ever return to Waikiki, I will definately stay here again.

<Content>Great Honeymoon Returned just a few days ago from a wonderful honeymoon in Hawaii. Although this was split into 3 different sections including firstly staying in Waikiki at the Aqua Wave and moving onto a 7 night cruise and then to Kona. We arrived late afternoon/early evening and the reception staff were excellent, very helpful and quick (very important when you consider it was around 5am UK time when we arrived) in getting us checked in and answering a few questions. She was most helpful in me trying to surprise my wife with a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries for the following night. However these never turned up, but the situation was quickly rectified once i advised reception. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. I especially liked the digital A/C which allowed you to know what temp you were setting instead of the ones where its hgh/medium/low settings and its hard to get it at the right temperature. The only criticism i could find with the room was a dripping tap, but you never noticed it, unless you were in the bathroom. Really it was fine and for anyone to complain would be someone wanting freebies. I did have 2 criticisms of the hotel though:Firstly, the pool was so small. I've seen bigger postal stamps, but none of the hotels seemed to have big pools, so guess its the norm in Hawaii. Secondly, the hotel doesn't have a restaurant, only a chain thing attached to it where the food is appaling. Sometimes room service can be a blessing, especially on honeymoon, when you don't really want to get dressed and go out!!!However, saying that, it wouldn't put me off staying there again. I would probably stay at one right on the sea front, rather than one block away as this one is, but it is a really nice hotel well situated relatively quiet, although they provide ear plugs if you are a light sleeper (nice touch, as the wife is!)I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Waikiki. Thank you for a wonderful stay.

<Content>50/50 toss up This hotel ended up being a toss up for us. Some parts we loved other parts not so much. The staff is extremely professional and were more than accommodating, they even upgraded us to a suite when they found out we were there to get married. Upon arrival to the room there was even a bottle of champagne. The hotel has been recently renovated but do not expect it to look brand new.....they tried but somethings still need to be replaced. The elevators on an average took about 5-10 minutes to even get on, the paint was obviously put over multiple layers, there is no bathroom fan, the continental breakfast is fairly small but they are suppose to be so don't expect something fantastic. You will also have to remember the street that this hotel sits on is extremely loud at night, the hotel does offer earplugs but as long as you are not a super light sleeper you should be fine, just don't be surprised to be woke up a couple times a night. The major problem came when we parked our rental car in their designated parking spots for $20 a day. We came out in the morning to find that the hotel had been painting parts of the exterior of the building right next to the car, combined with the slight breeze it blew white paint completely all over the back of the dark blue car. At first the maintenance man tried to argue that we couldn't prove that it was him but after another maintenance man joined us they agreed that they had made a mistake by not covering the car or having us called in the room to move it. It was a slight stress considering that it had us running behind on time to a scheduled tour. The next morning the manager met with us and stated that the car had been detailed and that if there was any issue with the rental car when we returned it to have them call and the hotel would take care of any problems. They also comped the three days of parking that we had. Overall it was a decent stay however we might look for somewhere else next time before staying again.One good thing to remember is that the International Market place is right next to and behind the hotel so it is very convenient to all of the shops and extremely convenient to the beach which is only about a block away

<Content>Stayed here and had to come back again and cant wait to come here again! The hotel is perfectly situated right down town Waikiki, next to the international market and two blocks from waikiki beach that is the first plus. They have tinted windows so you have privacy while enjoying the city or beach view. All of the staff where very friendly specially June and George they were great. Their prices are good also, the amount of amenities that they have for what you pay, Free wireless, A/C, Conciege, refrigerator and microwave in the room. Even though I own timeshare I preferred the Waikiki wave, I want to thank the staff for making my vacation so plesant.

<Content>Would and Have Stayed Here Before This was my third stay at the Wave. Went with my travel agent and friend--recommended it to her for our stay. We were up high on the 11th floor and could see the ocean from our one of two balconies (the other was over Kuhio St.). I love this hotel because of its' location and the rooms have been remodeled as of the last two years,and very well done. Staff is always great,helpful, and friendly. I would recommend staying up as high a floor as you can for the view. Breakfast is as everyone says, not a real breakfast, but the fruit at the grocery store one block away is expensive-they have apples, oranges and bananas, rolls, juice and coffee. Location is great, right next to the International Marketplace and the heart of Waikiki. Price is right, beds are very comfortable. DVD player provided-found a red box rental at grocery store for a dollar a day (Foodland one block away). Parking is harder if you get back late as your car is parked in slots on an elevated lift if parking lot is full, but if you call down from your room ahead, they will pull it out for you and you don't have to wait. Love this place and will be back!!

<Content>When in Waikiki, Ride the WAVE We stayed three nights at the Waikiki Wave before we were to board our ship for a cruise. I found the location great. We were right at the International Market, two blocks from Waikiki Beach, and surrounded by great restaurants. The hotel is older but has been renovated and the rooms were beautifully decorated with plenty of room. The beds were comfortable and we found everything in working order.What made this such a great place was the staff at the hotel. From the bellman, front desk, concierge, to the maids who kept our room clean and neat, they were all just so pleasant and helpful. They were quick to respond to our needs and gave great suggestions for local places to eat and shop. I believe I got an awful lot for the value of the room rate. We paid $195.94 per night including taxes. We had two queen beds, a desk and chair, refrigerator, coffee pot and microwave. There was a continental breakfast offered but we never did check that out. I was very pleased with the service of this hotel. They genuinely wanted you stay to be the best it could and they all did everything they could to make you feel welcomed.SincerelyA Very Satified Customer

<Content>could do better The hotel was clean, modern and the staff were more than helpful. However, the advertised pool was pitiful and very uninviting- at the back of the car park and dinghy. We also had continental breakfast included in the price and the breakfast was disgusting. It consisted of a few buns or pieces of bread fruit. They ran out of buns on many occasions.

<Content>Great central place to stay. The first time I stayed here was 3 years ago, good central place to be based but the interior was very tired.Now 3 years later it's all been updated and revamped and I was really pleased to stay there again. The location is great, bus stops are located just down the road(one direction) and also straight across the road(other direction), there are many places to eat nearby and a really short walk to the beach.The staff were very helpful and friendly, we had a problem when we checked in and were given a very small room with a trundle bed for 3 people (our travel agents fault), the desk sorted it all out, gave us a single and a double room for that night then next day they moved all our luggage to a more appropriate room while we were out.The breakfast could have been better, most days they ran out of bananas (or wouldn't get anymore out!) and the rolls were awful but we just went elsewhere for breakfast (plenty of choices)I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel, really you're only there to sleep and shower before going out again!

<Content>Rooms good, extra facilities can improve To be honest it was a good stay in this hotel.The hotel staff is really helpful and are always smiling.The rooms are really comfortable, they are just what you paid for... nothing luxurious, but it seems to be they were recently remodeled.The parking lot can be an issue if you are not early at sunset, even that they charge you a fee everyday around 18 USD.It has a little swimming pool and you have to cross thru the parking lot to reach it, it is tiny and seems that they put it just to avoid complains of no having a pool, in the whole week we stay there we did not use it, instead we walk to Waikiki beach that is really near from the hotel.If you travel with handicap people maybe its a little difficult since there's no access from the parking lot, unless you use the service lift where they carry the garbage and dirt blankets. From the main entrance, they have a special lift for handicap people, very useful.I recommend it if you are on a budget trip, it a good option and near of everything at walking distance.Other improvement is the breakfast included, it has just fruits, bread and juice or coffee, no ham , cheese or eggs; its very simple.Overall: good, I can go there again.

<Content>Great Place Three friends and I stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave in Honolulu, HI for 5 days at the end of September. We sought out this hotel after arriving in Waikiki to find that the accommodations we had booked online for the Hokele Suites were just NOT acceptable. Thankfully, the Aqua more than made up for the dissappointment of the Hokele Suites. All the employees of the Aqua were very courteous and welcoming. The room itself was FABULOUS. It was very spacious, very clean, well appointed, and had wonderfully comfortable beds. The location was great; relatively easy to get in  out of Waikiki, walking distance to the beach, and smack in the middle of all the great shopping and restaurants. For anyone renting a car, the parking garage is quite nice also. We are already looking forward to our next stay!! I would absolutely recommend the Aqua Waikiki Wave to anyone looking for a very nice, clean and quiet place to stay in Waikiki! Mahalo.

<Content>Bucket List Trip I am over 60 years old and part of my bucket list was to take my grandchildren to Hawaii. I have stayed at the Aqua Wave way back to when it was the Aston Coral Reef in 2001. The Aqua Wave has been my home away from home for three years now and we are already planning next years trip. We could stay just about any where--but why would we when we get so much personal care at the Wave. The location is perfect. We can see the shows at the International Market Place from our lanai. I have stayed in the same room for the past three times and plan on requesting it with time again soon.The staff is excited and accomodating. I want to thank my friend, Tasi and the rest of staff for making us feel at home. Thanks to Josh who met us at the street to assist us with our luggage and up to when we were in our room which was ready before we were. George, Susan, Josh, and Tasi (and others that I don't remember all names) made my grandsons so happy. The staff is a joy. Could not have asked for better. Where I work customer service is number one and when I go out and get the same attention is reason to applaud.Thank you again staff and friends and see you soon.A L O H A Nui Loa

<Content>Not unless you are desperate The only thing this hotel has going for it is that it is only one block from the beach. Even so, there are plenty of other places to stay that are just as close or even closer.While the room itself was adequate, don't expect to be spoiled.The building is old and leaks - one morning they had water dripping out of the ceiling near the lift on the first floor.The pool, or should I say a pond, is only accessible by walking out of the hotel and through the underground parking garage. Not exactly a convenient location.The 'free' continental breakfast is a disgrace - no milk or butter. Bread (no toaster) and a few bread rolls. IF you arrive in the first ten minuted you might be lucky enough to get a banana!!!! The coffee from the urn was cold and the only juice available was guava!!!!My advice is to anyone who is unlucky enough to stay here is to go next door to the bakery and spend a couple of dollars on a croissent, then head to Starbucks across the road for a coffee.Don't bother trying to get any information from the travel desk - the people who work there seem to know less than the average tourist - that is if they will get off the phone long enough to talk to you.Sorry to be so negative but these were my experiences.My advice is to look elsewhere

<Content>Hope you get your deposit back Made a rez for one room for three nights. They charged my cc immediately for one night as a deposit. Cancelled the rez fifteen days before check in date, way in front of the 24 hour cancellation deadline. Still holding my hand on my butt waiting for the refund of the deposit.Of course they say they've processed the refund but those mean and nasty banks are not crediting me. As a merchant accepting CC, my experience is that this story is nonsense. The credit hasn't been recd because they haven't processed it. Buyer beware.

<Content>Zero sleep!! I originally had the opportunity to stay on a friends sofa but thought after an 18 hour journey from the UK i would be better off booking this hotel for the first 2 nights in hawaii after reading previous favourable reviews. As you can imagine i was some what tired when i arrived and do not consider myself to be a light sleeper however what your not told is that the hotel is situated right next to a night club and also flanked on both sides by car parks so all i constantly heard for my stay was car alarms going off all night until about 4am in the morning, nice !! Room was basic and clean but as i hardly got any sleep i was extremely disappointed with my stay here and in all honestly i can go so far as to say this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at and a complete waste of $210, sooooo wish i had stayed on the sofa instead.

We booked the alohasuite and it was perfect for us. I wished the room had 2 bathrooms, but it was okay. The room was clean and our maid Florida treated us like queens! Special thanks to Darryl the bellman for arranging a shuttle to Waikele.It was nice to to see that this hotel treated Kamaainas with respect and appreciated us. Very nice people here. We can't wait to plan another getaway!

<Content>Wonderful Wave My husband and I just got back from our stay in Waikiki!! We were there for 5 days/4 nights for our good friend's wedding. We are a young married couple without children. We decided to stay at the Waikiki Wave because it was considerably cheaper than the beachfront hotels. Boy am I glad we stayed at the Wave!! Our room was large (2 queen beds for 2 people) and included a good sized mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee pot. From our balcony we could see the ocean to our left, the mountains to our right, and the hustle and bustle of Duke's Alley below. We felt like we were right in the middle of everything- shopping, restaurants, locals, surfers, tourists, etc. The staff was very accomodating and helpful with all kinds of questions and requests, including bus information, information about local beaches, the USS Arizona, etc. The walk to the beach was no longer than 5 minutes and it included many different adventurous routes- through the International Market or the International Food Court- which were both really fun. We also booked a couples massage at the Aqua Bamboo just down the street and it was heavenly and very reasonably priced. We did not go to the pool because we live in the Midwest and preferred to spend our time out in the beautiful ocean. My only complaint pertains to the continental breakfast. It is very minimal (rolls and fruit) but the hotel is right next to several inexpensive restaurants including The Seaside Grill which offers a $3.99 breakfast and also the Food Pantry, a cute little grocery store with a coffee shop and cream puff store attached. (The cream puffs are to die for...) There is also a Denny's and a McDonald's within a block from the Wave. All of the other great things about the Wave definitely made up for the (in my opinion) sub-par breakfast. We were thrilled with our experience at the Waikiki Wave and I wish we were still there! 5 stars to the Wave and mahalo to all of the wonderful cousins!!p.s. I hope to post pictures after a nap today!

<Content>Simple and inexpensive Hawaii holiday If you are after any kind of luxurious or romantic getaway than this hotel is not the place for you. The rooms are a good size and are kept clean and tidy. Housekeeping and other staff are friendly and helpful. It is located centrally and is near good restaurants and not far from the beach. If you want the extra benefits that you don't believe the Wave provides then stop being a [--] and go pay the money to stay somewhere 4Star or above.We had a very pleasant stay at the Wave and would recommend it to anyone who wants a inexpensive Hawaii holiday where they spend their time outdoors (as you should be in this beautiful place) and not in their hotel!

<Content>Just Love It! Wow, loved this place. Checked the internet for rates and called the hotel direct and got a $140 rate with a free upgrade to a corner suite. Man was the view of the pink hotel spectacular! I really loved the location which was close to everything but most of all I really enjoyed talking story with the staff. The bellman Vince was cool and Susan at the Front Desk was really helpful to me when asking about directions and where to eat. We can't wait to go back next year. Why pay $300 for a hotel room on the beach when you can stay for less and get more space (yep, the rooms are big!) and feel at home.

<Content>How can this hotel be rated so highly?????? The only thing I can say about this hotel was it was inexpensive. The hotel staff were rude. There is a pool in the parking lot that is so small an unappealing you would not want to use it. The staff said breakfast was not included even though trip advisor said it was. The location was okay but the lobby is in terrible condition. The room was just okay - the bathroom lighting was awful and you could hardly see yourself. Would never stay there again!

<Content>Nice hotel, great staff Our honeymoon in Hawaii was great and we stayed in Aqua Waikiki Wave when we were in Oahu. The reviews say it is best value for money and it definitely is. The hotel was good, located pretty close to the beach and a lot of shops and restaurants around. The staff were very helpful esp Tasi, George and Susan. It was a very memorable stay for us because the 2nd day of our stay happened to be my husband's birthday. I spoke with Tasi to make arrangements for the birthday party and she coordinated very well. George did a great job decorating the room when we were out which was a great surprise for my husband. They made our stay happy and pleasant.

<Content>Good Price for a Good Hotel So this is the 2nd Aqua hotel we have stayed at in Honolulu, and just like the other hotel, it's exactly what you pay for. We paid $119 for a Partial Ocean view (and I mean Partial) but for that price I really can't complain. Fairly clean room decent ammenities, and centerally located. All in all it works. It's not luxury and it's not special........it just works. For a moderatly priced hotel in paradise, this is a great choice.

<Content>Good Hotel Close to Everything The Waikiki Wave is close to everything you need. The room was large and clean and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was friendly and even took off my parking garage fee since i returned my rental car the 2nd day! The only cons are small, the elevator usually took awhile to come and at times the 1 desk clerk got behind w/multiple check ins/outs. Overall i had an enjoyable stay and would stay at the Aqua Waikiki Wave again.

<Content>Waikiki Wave - Great Location and Value My wife and I stayed at Waikiki Wave for 8 nights, 8/28-9/5 2008 for our first visit to Hawaii. I made the selection due to the high rating on TripAdvisor as well as the central location. We arrived around 10pm after a 12+ hour flight from Florida via Atlanta...and check-in was quick. I had booked a Deluxe Room...and noticed that the day before we left that although the rate for the first 3 days of our stay had gone up, the last 5 days the cost had gone down...I emailed and asked if we could take advantage of the new rates, and got an immediate email response that canceled our first reservation and a new reservation made that saved us over $100 for the 8 nights. MUCH APPRECIATED!Although we came back many afternoons to find that our room had not been refreshed yet, having previously had part ownership in a Sleep Inn, I can understand the need to make over the rooms of those that check-out before doing the rooms of the continuing guests. Our room was on the 12th floor (1213) which allowed great views to the east -- and even the top most point of Diamond Head, a couple wide views of the Pacific to the south, and view of the north with great rainbows after the short afternoon rain over the mountain. The balcony overlooked the entertainment area of the International Market Place... which always ended by 10pm, so was not an interference at all for sleep.The Expedia staff at the Concierge staff were very helpful in making suggestions for tours, and we did a last minute choice to fly to the Big Island for the Volcano Night tour. We did not rent a car -- but walked almost everywhere due to the central location to Waikiki. We did get the 4-day Visitor Bus Pass for $20 and used it for such trips to Diamond Head and even to the North Shore to get one of the famous snow cones. We had gone past it on our Grand Island Tour a few days earlier ... and Honolulu has an amazing public bus transit system.We usually ate breakfast in our room (did not opt for the continental breakfast plan) since we had a microwave and refrigerator. We found that most all the nicer eating places had lunch prices or early birds until 5 or 6pm. We saved a great deal by eating earlier. This included Cheesecake Factory, Atlantis, etc. The gift shop at the front entrance had deals as good as the International Market Place and Dukes Lane, and went in there about everyday to pick up shirts, hats, even snacks. The clerk was tireless there from open to close and very helpful. (The Food Pantry just a couple blocks away across the street to the east is a full grocery store, and a better option to the ABC Stores for food items - has deli areas as well.)Aqua Resorts seem to have their act together and have done almost a phenomenal job at remodeling this older hotel (a few cracked tiles in the shower, but all plumbing worked fine). The bed was one of the most comfortable we have had in a hotel ... the decor was exactly like their website photos - no bait switch and tactics with the photos. The lobby was smaller than the larger hotels but more than adequate with a seating area, the concierge desks, and a few small shops, plus a couple restaurants, business center, etc. The free Wi-Fi seemed slow although I had a very good to excellent signal ... so opted for my Sprint Broadband Wireless modem most of the time. All the staff from the front desk to maintenance to housekeeping always greeted us with an Aloha and/or Mahalo which shows they really care about their guests.This is certainly a location to consider as an option to the higher priced rooms in the area...and very centrally located.

The rooms were large compared to most hotels. There was a microwave and refrigerator in our room and we had free Wireless Internet. I would suggest staying in an upper floor room due to noise from the street. The hotel does supply earplugs if needed. The only problem we encountered was limited parking at the Hotel. We just arrived back at the Hotel early in the day and was able to park without difficulty.

<Content>Perfect place to stay Our 5 night stay at the Aqua Wave was great. We originally booked a deluxe room but after doing some research upgraded to the Aloha Suite ,so we had a seperate bedroom to the kids. Our room was 1415 which had an awesome water view and 2 balconys and a very spacious area with the 2 other queen beds. Although I had read reviews stating their was alot of noise, we didn't have any complaints at all. The staff there were the most pleasant and eager to please I have ever encountered and the location to all the Waikiki attractions was also great. I had to call the front desk as I accidently changed the lock on our safe and we had a staff member arrive within minutes to open it for me. I would totally recommend this hotel to everyone, it was the best location and for a very reasonable price. My in-laws regularly stop in Honolulu as escorts for travel groups of up to 40 people and I am going to let them know about this hotel for their next stop over.

<Content>Big improvement We have stayed here in the past, but this time we opted for the little bit larger suite for the extra room. Housekeeping was always there if we needed anything extra. Now the continental breakfast is right in the hotel which is nice. We found the workout room quite by accident when we walked to the morning continental breakfast...it would have been nice if we were told about it at check-in. They have two elevators and most of the time one wasn't running, but they got it up and going as quickly as possible. the parking is VERY limited if you have a rental car. The location is right alongside the International Marketplace so it is very noisy in the evening, but within walking distance to the beach,zoo,Aquarium,the Duke Statue,etc. I know that we will be staying there again.

<Content>Great Deal and Location My husband and I just returned from our 7 days Hawaii cruise with relatives and friends.Using TripAdvisor's website opinions/reviews/rating, I booked eleven (11) rooms with Aqua Waikiki Wave Hotel for our overnight stay after our Hawaii cruise and return flight to USA mainland.On our way to the hotel after the Arizona/Pearl Harbor tour, our Robert's Hawaii driver announced to the group that our hotel is in a 'dangerous zone' for SHOPPING! We arrived at the hotel and I completely agree that it is a shopping mecca, i.e. near the International Market and as well as other shops. Our room at the 15th floor with 2 balconies, was spacious, very clean, and great beds. My relatives and friends rooms were on the 8th, 12th, and 15th floor. They were very satisfied with their rooms, too. The hotel staff were very helpful.We ate at the Seafood chinese restaurant inside the hotel and the food was excellent and reasonably priced. There are other known restaurants nearby, i.e. PF Changs, etc.I HIGHLY recommend the Aqua Waikiki Wave hotel. All of us WILL DEFINITELY stay at Aqua Waikiki Wave hotel for future Hawaii trip in Oahu.

<Content>Noisy 6th floor Recently stayed at the Aqua Wave with the family, (Aug 15-22).DO NOT STAY on the Diamond Head side of the building on any of the lower floors. We were on the 6th floor and the noise was terrible. Everything from the noisy vehicle parking building operating all night right across from us. The bar that let out every night at 2:00 a.m. with plastered patrons. The 24 hour open Jack In the Box  restaurant, (across the street), which featured constant loud yelling and laughter from the kids that hung out in front of the restaurant all night long. As well as the International Market Place band shell right next to the hotel that featured some very loud performances, (although usually only a couple hours long).If you need your sleep, go somewhere else, or stay on the other side of the building on a higher floor.Otherwise the building was clean, neat and well kept, and close to everthing.

<Content>Good value, nice people The Aqua Wave is a good chioce. Lots going for it. Great location. In the center of everything. Not too far from the beach, but far enough to save a few dollars. Waikiki is not cheap, so don't campare it to some hotel in another city. There was some noise, but not every night. No worse than most good locations in Waikiki. Ear plugs helped when needed. Hotel provided. The room was a nice size, way bigger than the Ohana West (worst).It was in good shape, nice comfortable beds, very nice soft sheets. Nice touches were free wireless internet, room safe and local calls. The breakfast was OK, but more variety would be nice. If you don't like the bun or muffin of the day you are out of luck. They had bread, but no toaster. Last I checked I can buy a toaster for what a loaf of bread costs in Waikiki! The bathroom lights were very dim. The day we checked in we commented on how dark the hallways were, it was like the next day they changed out the lightbulbs, a very good improvement.Over all a good choice. Hope to stay there again. Upgrade to the higher floors, only cost a little more. The lower floors have no view, don't even open the drapes. We were on the 12th floor. Nice view.If you rent a car, pick it up in Waikiki, and return it the same day, check how late you can drop it off. Parking is spendy .Don't take the shuttle bus. Google discount taxi Waikiki. Three people cost about the same as the big bus, and takes about an hour less!If you can find a better place for less money let me know.Aloha Dan in Minnesota

The staff looking after the Surfer Room during breakfast, particularly Flora and Alma were always there to make sure we were looked after. Flora even gave each of us boxes of Hawaiian chocolates as a souvenir, which was very touching, considering the very low wages the staff in the island get. The room housekeeper, Marilyn, was great and her level of cleanliness in our rooms were excellent!

Better late than never for our review.After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor we decided to book for 3 nights pre cruise.We stayed in Junior Suite Partial Ocean View which gave us a higher floor so noise was not an issue.The rooms had been renovated about a year prior to our stay and the pictures you see on Aqua resort website are exactly as shown.The room was spacious,extremely clean, the beds very very comfortable. The mini fridge and micro where also handy to have.The staff were very friendly and informative.This hotel is located a couple blocks from the beach and in the heart of the shopping district. Just a great location! Also lots of restaurants near by.We would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Just as fabulous the second time around! This was our second stay at the Aqua Waikiki Wave in the past year. We bought our two sons (19 and 23) and stayed in an Aloha Suite Deluxe Wave on the 12th floor. We had 3 queen beds(these are such comfortable beds), 1 in a screened off room with a wardrobe etc, so it felt like 2 rooms, very private. 2 televisions a dvd player, huge room, two balconies and a view to beautiful Diamond Head The staff are so helpful and friendly, location is fantastic for the price, we can't fault this accommodation. We loved our stay. Thanks again we'll be back....soon I hope.

<Content>Loved the Wave I stayed at this hotel Aug 6-13th and had a great experience at Aqua Waikiki Wave. First time in HI, had no idea where to stay, since there are so many hotels in the city. The hotel is smaller than the usual high rises you see on the beach, BUT it's renovated, which makes for a big difference. We booked a partial view suite, highly recommend, we had two balconies, high floor and view of the beach, not up close but further away but still nice. Very clean place, our room was well taken care of, didn't have ANY problems or issues. Staff was very nice. Highly recommend, very close to the beach, to Internantional Market place, as well as all the shops. Loved the place. It's cheaper than the other hotels, so it was a great deal.

<Content>Aqua Wave was great I was aware of the Hotel location prior to making the reservation. The hotel staff was great, location was great. I was on the 11th floor which had very little noise from below. The elevators are in good working order and the wait was minimal. The price was right and the accomodations were great for the price. I could not be happier with the overall experience at the Aqua Wave. I will stay at this hotel on my next trip.For the budget traveler, this is a good hotel to stay at. It is not a Five star hotel and you get what you pay for.

<Content>Very good price The hotel is relatively basic. The reception is very small. I did not see anywhere for eating. The room was large and clean but again quite basic. However the location and price more than made up for this. The hotel is only a few blocks from the beach and there are plenty of bus stops right outside that make getting anywhere on the island very easy.There are several much nicer and impressive hotels nearby but then you dont go to Hawaii to spend time in your hotel. There are plenty of places to pick up food for breakfast and lunch and lots of restaurants for dinner.

<Content>Very good choice of hotel. I am a real estate agent in Canada. I really needed a break and at the same time, since I was in Honolulu for two weeks with my son, I was looking for a clean place, close to everything without having to rent a car. We spent 14 nights at the Waikiki Wave Hotel and let me tell you, what a nice vacation we had!The hotel is close to everything. Beach, restaurants, marketplace, bus stop, name it !!Our room was on the 12th floor. Beautiful view, very clean room, beds were also very very comfortable, we had everything we expected. We appreciated the check-in which only took a few minutes especially after a tweve hour flight. All employees were also very kind and helpful. We really felt at home. I'm planning on going back again next summer. Waikiki is also a very clean city. Ohahu Island is worth to be seen! There are lots of things to do. Submarine tours, boat tours, surfing lessons, luaus, hula lessons, cayaking at Kaiula bay (beautiful), snorkeling at Hanauma Bay, shopping, etc..  It's a long way from home but the weather is worth it, no rain except for little mist once in a while coming from the mountains but how appreciated!! It only lasts a minute or less. Waking up in the morning and not having to worry about the weather is very convenient. You never need to cancel your activities.I've been travelling a lot in the Carribeans, Mexico and the United States but since I've discovered Hawaii, I just can't wait to go backand defenitely at the same hotel.Thank you Waikiki Wave !!! See you again next year! Line RIendeauBoisbriand, Qc.Canada

<Content>Great Value, Great Location, Spotless We were very pleased with our stay at the Aqua Waikiki Wave. The hotel was spotless. Our very large room (jr. suite) was on the corner of the hotel. We had two balconies which proved great for drying beach towels. The staff were very nice and friendly. We spent 9 nights at the hotel and because of the size of the room we never felt cramped. The bathroom is quite small, however. We had in room coffee pot, microwave, ,fridge in the room. Parking is limited on site, but when it fills up parking is available less than a block away. We were charged $18 each day for parking and never really struggled to find a place to park. The hotel is in a very urban environment and Kuhio is a main avenue with plenty of traffic. The noise you'll hear primarliy comes from The Bus and motorcycles. The hotel does provide ear plugs. Something beyond their control was garbage collection each moring about 6:15 AM Mon-Sat. This woke us up each morning but we quickly went back to sleep. We did a lot of walking in the neighborhood with our two sons (ages 7  9). We felt very safe everywhere we went. We were not bothered by anyone. The area was remarkably clean for an urban downtown area. No trash anywhere. The continental breakfast is very limited. In the area there are a vast amount of choices for food. We particularly liked the traditional Hawaiian BBQ drive-in's such as LL, Zippy's, Bob's BBQ, and Rainbow. Delicious food at very affordable prices. $20-30 for lunch or dinner for 4 people. Overall our trip was wonderful. We toured the entire island from the North Shore to the windward coast and everything in between. The hotel added much to our enjoyment of our trip as it surpassed our expectations, from size of the room, condition of the rooms and public areas and the staff.

<Content>Disappointed return guest We are return guests having previous stayed at this hotel in February. I am writing this review to express our disappointment at our recent stay in this hotel Aqua Waikiki Wave Resort (11th July- 18th July).  We had a very unpleasant experience at this property starting with the shuttle service that was highly recommended by the hotel. The shuttle driver refused to take us back from Waikele when we had already paid for a return trip and off loaded us to another shuttle service which had little or no air conditioning and the return trip was extremely uncomfortable as the shuttle had 12 people. We had advised the hotel staff of our experience our complaint was not actioned during our stay. No feedback was given to us and no action was taken.  Aside from this, our suite was on the fifth floor facing the International Marketplace and garbage area which disturbingly surrounded the swimming pool. No surprise really that during our week long stay we saw no one swim in the pool - to acces this facility you had to walk past a car park via an alley way climb a flight of stairs to reach the pool which from our fifth floor vantage point we saw was surrounded by garbage bins from nearby food hall.It is disappointing that this recently refurbished property has no double glazing to cut out the noise from the nightly concerts and daily dawn garbage pick-ups. Ear plugs can't drown out the noise and during our stay we were highly inconvenienced by the nocturnal painting on the corridors and doors, fire drills as well as the elevator maintenance during this peak period. There is also very little hot water after 9 p.m.  We are planning another vacation in November back to Honolulu and have decided we will not be staying at this property. We no longer recommend this hotel to our family, friends and colleagues as our stay was marred by these daily incidents compounded by front line staffs lack of concern for guest satisfaction.

<Content>Nice Hotel My girls under 19 soccer team were selected to play in the AYSO National Games in Waipio, HI, this meant that we had to find a hotel that could accommodate a group of 17 girls and parents. After our travel agent delayed our booking at another hotel I found the Wave on Trip Advisor and suggested that we stay there. The reviews on TA were very helpful and right on. This hotel, while not the Marriott is a nice property. The rooms were clean and up to date. Newer carpet, flat screen TVs, microwaves, refrigerators and coffee makers were nice amenities for the rooms. The beds were very comfortable. We stayed in the deluxe rooms on the 11th floor. The hotel staff was very accommodating and arranged for the 5 rooms that we had to be next to each other. Complementary continental breakfast is also included. The sales manager, Evelyn was very accommodating and arranged for the breakfast to open an hour early on the two days that we had early games. The hotel is nicely located about 2 blocks from Waikiki beach front, an easy walk. Also located close to restaurants and shopping.There were only two downfalls of the hotel, the pool was very small and looked like it was an afterthought. It didn't even feel like it was part of the hotel; no spa. Also the parking was very limited, if you weren't in the parking by 6 or 7 pm you had to park an a public parking structure. Make sure you find out from the Wave which structure to park in, the difference can mean paying $6 for 10 hours or $36. The good side was that as long as you provided receipts for other parking you were not changed the $18 parking fee at the hotel.Overall the hotel was a good buy.

<Content>Great Hotel Our family of four, including our 19 and 22 year old children, stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave Hotel in mid June. After an incredibly long flight from the Midwest, and the loss of one piece of luggage at the airport, we were greeted by George at the Aqua Wave front desk. George understood our frustrating day and offered to upgrade us to a room on the 12th floor. Our room was wonderful. It was located on the corner of the building with a great vew of the ocean from one lanai and the mountains from the other lanai. We booked a junior suite with 3 queen beds, which worked out very well for our family. It was very spacious, clean, and well appointed, including a flat screen TV! The staff couldn't have been more accommodating. They were very helpful, friendly and efficient in any of the requests we made or questions we had. George even gave us extra cookies to go with the coffee we made in our room! It was a short, pleasant walk to the beach passing many great stores; Coach, Louis Viton . . . I would reccommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>LOVED LOVED LOVED the Aqua Waikiki Wave - Hotel, Location, Staff After reading some reviews, I feel compelled to write and tell what a wonderful hotel this is. Our family travelled to Waikiki with another family in April of 2008. We have been to Hawaii several times and absolutely love it. When we arrived and throughout our stay we were greeted by very friendly and helpful Bell Men (Darryl and James - totally awesome) and Front Desk Staff (George and especially Josh, who we LOVE). The hotel has recently been competely renovated and the rooms are very large and nicely decorated. People who complain about the small TV need to ask themselves why they are going to Hawaii to watch television. The cleaning staff are very courteaus and although there were a couple days they were running late getting our rooms clean, they were always available to provide clean towels when needed. Not too concerned about my bed being made when I don't always get it done at home. The location of the hotel is excellent - smack dab in the middle of Waikiki, surrounded by lots of restaurants and shopping. The beach is less than a 5 minute walk. The street walkers at night are not a problem as neither my husband nor his friend were approached at all and we were with children who were totally oblivious.It does get noisy at night, but you are in Waikiki and you will hear the noise in most hotels anyway. Plus this hotel provides earplugs if you need them.I can't say enough about this hotel, it's location and wonderful staff. We will definitely be staying there again on our trip next year. This hotel, rated 8 of 87 hotels in Waikiki at the time of this review, is a diamond in the rough.....you won't be sorry if you stay, but please remember when comparing hotels to compare apples to apples. It is not the Ritz Carlton, but not many are and who has the money to pay for that anyway, right!! Enjoy your stay at the Waikiki Wave!!!

<Content>Great value, awesome location. My family stayed at the Wave for four nights, 2 in June and 2 in July. We had to make our flight connections in Honolulu for our trip to the big island and Kauai so we added an extra night each way to enjoy Oahu. Overall it was a great deal and the location is fantastic, right next to the international marketplace, about one to two blocks from the beach depending on the route you take. We spent our time on Oahu exploring the shoreline from Diamond head to the north shore and spent very little time in Waikiki.Rooms are quite good. We stayed in a family suite with lots of room and three double beds (one in a room that can be seperated with sliding screens). The beds and bedding are excellent quality. There was a small fridge to keep your drinks cool. Each room had it's own flat screen tv. Yes, the lights in the bathroom are energy savers and take a minute to warm up to full brightness. Leave the lights on if it bothers you and you don't care about saving energy. The hotel is an older building but I think they've done a great job in upgrading the property. The washroom and showers are basic, no high end fixtures but plenty of water and water pressure. Please note if you open a balcony door the air conditioning turns off automatically. We didn't quite close the door all the way and the room warmed up very quickly.Wifi was free and much appreciated. The pool is small, difficult to get to through the parking lot, located in an alley, and your view is a fence. We didn't bother even trying to use it. Parking is tight but we always found a spot.Noise. We were on the 9th and 10th floors during our stay. I had read the reviews and was expecting it to be noisy. I only noticed the noise one night when someone was having a fight/screaming match in the alley below. I have to say it was so noisy that I thought the window had been left open, but it was closed and I could still hear them arguing from the 9th floor. I think it depends on where the noise is coming from and how it bounces off the buildings.Service was excellent with a few qualifiers. I had the same desk person as was noted in some previous reviews. He was attentive and pleasant but neglected to give us some very important information. We didn't know about the continental breakfast on the first floor until our second stay, and we found out about it from another visitor. When we tried to use it the last morning of our stay, we found out you also had to book the breakfast and get vouchers from the front desk, or you had to pay $5 each. For coffee, muffins and some fruit it didn't seem worth $5. It's a very basic continental breakfast but a good deal for free!. It would have been nice to be told about it at check in. We were not told where the pool was. If I hadn't read some reviews before we left I would not have known it was there. We were not told about the overflow parking area but it never came up because we always found a spot. They REALLY need to put a sign up to show the parking lot entrance. We found it on our second time around the block only because the alley seemed the only possible entrance.Brian (or the Big Brown Guy) at the front door was fantastic, really helpful, cheerful and full of Aloha spirit. I hope the management appreciates how much the guests enjoy him.Overall I'd reccomend this place for the price and location. I'd stay here again. Ask for the highest floor possible to reduce the noise.

<Content>It made our vacation! We were in Hawaii for what was to be a week of fun and relaxation, and we were supposed to stay with someone we knew who has a condo in Waikiki. It worked out very badly, so we were in need of a hotel QUICKLY, and the Aqua Waikiki Wave was the only one that had a room that wasn't twin beds. We booked and got to the hotel and were greeted by the bellman, who carried ALL of our very HEAVY bags into the hotel for us with a sweet smile on his face. The check in was fast and George and Susan at the front desk were professional and very friendly. We got one of the last rooms that slept three (we had three in our party), and it was a handicapped equipped room. I did not like the bathroom, as it had no shelves (for wheelchair access) or counters, which led to a small mishap in the bathroom. When I called the front desk to complain, I was referred to the manager and told that as soon as they had a free room the next morning, our room would be changed. Imagine my delight when we went out to breakfast only to return later and find that not only had our room been changed, but we'd been upgraded to a suite with two balconies (windows on TWO walls with a view of the mountains!) and a KING and QUEEN bed inside it. Both the standard and the upgraded rooms were equipped with extra electrical outlets, refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave oven. It had an iron and ironing board and a blow dryer (a real one, not one of those wall mounted ones). The rooms are decorated exquisitely, and the color scheme is perfect for the islands. It was such a real delight to find such fantastic and responsive employees and management at this hotel. I will search for the Aqua brand WHEREVER I travel; and I travel a lot.The only cons were the fact that the business center was not gratis, you had to pay 15 cents/minute for internet usage, although wifi in the rooms was provided, and it was very easy to connect and fast. Also, the pool is really small and old because the hotel has been remodeled, (fantastic remodel) but the pool has not yet been done.

<Content>bed bugs infested hotel...... Beware of bed bugs..again....room 703!!!! We stayed here for 11 nights and on our 2nd night we had bed bugs bite/rash on our legs. We informed front desk and asked them to change the sheets hoping that would solve the problem but it did not. They offered to move us to another room but the idea of bed bugs in this hotel has really ruined our family vacation. We asked to talk to a manager so we can file a formal complaint but the front desk informed us that they were busy, it seems to me that they know they have bug infestation since i'm not the first one and for sure will not be the last one to complain about bed bugs. Management and staff is too afraid to confront the situation professionally and gave us the runaround. All they try to do is make the room look clean again and worry about the bed bugs later. I dare management to stay at this hotel for one night and let us know about it. Since this hotel was part of a package deal and as much as I want to check in to another hotel I was hesitant and didn't want the hassle of trying to get a refund and tried to enjoy our family vacation as best as we can. We are still waiting to be contacted by management and since they're too afraid to handle the truth this is the only avenue a consumer like us have. Also not a great place to park your car for $18/day, half of the parking spot is too small and if you happen to be out until 8pm or later good luck finding a parking spot here. The only thing we regret about our hawaii vacation is this crappy, dirty, unprofessional hotel. Next time we visit Honolulu this will be the last place we will recommend to our friends/family.

<Content>Great Place and Great Staff This place is great! From the time I flew in to HI, called and requested early check-in after flying through the night (from Tokyo to HI with 2 young children), it was no problem and the staff was always around to help. The hotel was welcoming and had a homey comfortable feel. Really treated you like family instead of guests. They took the time to know your name and your kids names and were a huge help to get around. (calling for taxis and helping find places to take children and even asking how your adventure turned out when you came back to hotel). Concierge was wonderful to help book our Luau. I can't say enough. I would definitely stay again. I love Hawaii and with it being my first time there (and hearing about a few awful places) I was so relieved to stay at a Hotel that was so nice and laid back. I didn't have a room with a great view but it was decent enough for the short times I did spend in my room! Huge, soft beds, clean rooms, housekeeping was awesome.. Close to everything in Waikiki and a short walk to the beach! LOVED IT!!

<Content>A little sketchy, but good price! My husband and I stayed at the Wave while we were in town for a family wedding. The price was good for being so close to Waikiki Beach - only a block or two away - and near shops, restaurants and about 8 ABC stores. Because it's in downtown Honolulu, it can be pretty loud at night, but the staff was pretty helpful. I did feel a little mislead by the hotel website because it looked really fancy and that wasn't the case. And be prepared for slow elevators. But if you're looking for a nice crash pad downtown without a lot of extras, it's the place for you!

<Content>Great Hotel! good Deal! Pleasantly surprised with renovations - wonderful! very clean,modern, room, beds, shower great...all terrific! spend the extra get a partial view at least...15th floor fabulous to see! Suites are loaded with room....Extremely friendly staff- Mahalo Josh! for helping us and our kids (graduates) have a great time..continental breakfast was just right --beautiful fresh fruit( bananas, apples, oranges, muffins, rolls, juice, coffee ( toaster would've been nice for the wonderful bread!)...and helped alot with our 6 high schoolers each day! would absolutely stay again, easy acess to beach, food, fast food across the street, next to IMP, and friendly, helpful staff --Front Desk, VInce, Malia and Chris(Concierge was VERY helpful) and all the cousins!...all were very helpful and helped us moms out with our trip. Reasonable price for great location-just walk thru Int'l Market Place and cross street from Dukes/Sheraton. Great restaurant in hotel, sadly we didn't try till last day there...was very nice..Pool out of the way, but who goes to the pool when you are 50 yards from one of the best beaches in the world? Been to Waikiki 4 times and still happy with choice of accommodations. Mahalo!-D.,So. California

<Content>Travel agents review Just stayed at the Wave 25-30th June and it was pretty good. First of all i am a travel agent so i can say i would honestly send my clients here if they were looking for a moderate accomodation. Front staff were friendly and efficient, rooms were very clean and comfortable (great beds), i would say it is a very nice 3 star hotel and has a good location. We were on the 15th floor and had a partial ocean view which was nice. The continental breakfast is not really a continental breakfast. Don't expect to fill up on it. Mostly fruit, coffee and muffins. Other rooms might be different with the noise but YES it is noisy! Obviously being at a prime location in downtown Honolulu it is going to be noisy. Be prepared and bring ear plugs. They do provide one set in the room. The beach was a bit of a hike but not too bad...seemed further than the block and a half everyone said. Being right beside the International Marketplace was fun and there was great shopping in the area. I noticed one persons review saying that there were prostitutes in the area and unfortunatly yes they are around though i never once felt unsafe in the area. I think you are going to get that around most of the hotels in that area. The Aqua Wave does have security lock the door at 10pm and then anyone coming in has to swipe their card. All in all i did like it and yes i would stay here again.

<Content>Beat my expectations Wow!! If you want a less expensive hotel off the beach, this is it!! Sit back this may take a couple of minutes. We were here 3 nights. We had a King bed suite on the 9th floor, so the garbage pick up was not very loud. The room was really clean, and the bed was very comfortable. After we checked in, we went out to look around awhile. when we came back there was a bottle of champain, and a box of chocolate covered Macadamiea nuts, (our travel agent had let them know we were on our 25th anniversary). waiting for us The view from the front of our lanai, (looking west), was another building, but to the right was the mountians, and the beach to the left. The staff were very helpful and friendly, and had written directions, to any location. The parking garage is very limited, but the rack-em, and stack-em system, across the alley, is kind of fun to watch, and even though you may have to wait in line, it moves really fast. The hotel is right in the center of all the action, but we never saw any street girls, and we came in late a couple of times. Going out to the right, (west) the International market place is just a 1/2 block away, and just at the entrance, on one side is the PUKA Dog,(a twist on hot dogs that we saw on Food network,realy good), also upstairs is the Galaxy restaraunt, ($2.99 for 2 pancakes, 2 backon/sausage, 2 eggs),[watch out milk is $2.50 a glass]. I will say the hotel breakfast changes each day, and is sometimes good, and sometimes not, but a Galaxy breakfast will eliminate the need for a big lunch. To the left leaving the hotel is an alley, which is full of street venders, where great deals are to be had,. and if you continue to the beach stay to the right of the Royal hawian hotel(pink) and you will go through the lobby of the Waikiki Sheridan, and come out @ their pool, which if you do @ sunset you will happen up on the nightly hula show. The Duke Kahanamoku statue is 2-3 blocks East, on the beach, and has a web-cam on it so you can call your friends, and wave at them live, on computer.

<Content>An excellent hotel in Waikiki Having recently spent 2 weeks in the Aqua Waikiki Wave Hotel, I would thoroughly recommend it. We stayed in a corner room on the 7th Floor. This was a lovely large room containing 2 queensize beds, several armchairs, microwave, hairdryer , iron,and coffee maker. Because it was a corner room we had two balconies both of which had outdoor chairs and table, The hotel is very central, next door to the International Markets, only a block away from the beach, and had plenty of eating outlets close by. Shopping in and around the markets was good fun.Were there any negatives? The noise from the night market's was minimal and was usually finished by 10.30pm. However the emptying of rubbish bins in the early morning was as good as an alarm clock, but I understand most hotels in Waikiki would have this problem. The staff were very friendly and could not have been more helpful when asked for directions or information etc.. A blown light globe was replaced within minutes of our request.

<Content>Highly Recommend Perfact location. Close to beach and in the heart of downtown Waikiki. Staff very friendly and helpfull. Clean and comfortable room. No problem with outside noise from fifth floor, unless lanai door was open. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks Aqua, for making it a wonderful family vacation.

<Content>So Pretty I stayed in the Partial Ocean View Junior Suite for 5 nights and absolutely loved it! The decor and ocean views are so pretty. The room was spacious and a continental breakfast was included as part of our package. In reception Josh was really friendly and helpful. The hotel is really close to the international marketplace which was good for getting souvenirs.. (don't forget to bargain if you go there) and the beach and Cheesecake Factory weren't too far to walk - (Best Cheesecake in the world for those not from the US). I'd definitely go back there again.

<Content>Fabulous location!! We stayed at the Waikiki Wave for our honeymoon in January, and really enjoyed it! It was in a fantastic location, and was nice, comfy and relaxed.Perhaps because it was our honeymoon, we were upgraded to a suite with 3 queen beds! Yay! We only ever used 1 bed, but it was nice to be able to spread out. We also had two balconies, which was lovely as well - with a small glimpse of the ocean over the other hotels right on the beach.Waikiki Wave is situated just behind the International Marketplace, which you can walk through to get to the main shopping area and the beach. 5 minute walk to the beach - perfect!We were slightly worried after reading the reviews here that mentioned prostitutes hanging around everywhere - bah! We saw one or two, but they never approached us. Never an issue. Overall, a fun place with a relaxed vibe! We'd definitely stay there again!

<Content>an okay hotel , nice staff. We had room 1517, a junior suite with a view and a balcony. The view from the bedroom was the garage roof of the property in front, when you looked out on the balcony to the left you do see the pink Royal Hawaiian and a bit of the ocean, and to the left the northern hills of Honolulu. The hotel boosts a very extensive upgrading, indeed the room was newly done, with a very good AC ( shuts itself when you open door to the balcony, nice idea ) with a very nice reprint of Charles W Bartlett art work, excellent bed, lots of pillows, good Oah'u coffee (and Lipton tea bags.) Room was very clean. Room has a refrigerator, a microwave, ironing board and uses good quality shampoo and cream rinse.Nice towels, no bath-robe.The bathroom is still from the 1960's, the ventilation does not work and the room is very very small with ceiling tiles and sink left as is. The counter has been replaced and maybe the tiles around the tub. The shower head is the original one and the draining takes a long time. The commode has a mind of its own and flushes when it feels like it. We visited another room hoping to get a bigger bathroom, to no avail, they are all alike.Honolulu has hundred of hotels, take your time, check around, for $144 per night + taxes, the Aqua Wave is not up to snuff.The housekeeping staff was friendly and responded quickly to exchanging the non-working hair-dryer and the housekeeper on our floor (top floor by the way) always greeted us in the morning. There are apples on the reception desk and the Honolulu advertiser paper is at your door every morning. The hotel is 2 blocks from Waikiki beach and very easy access to bus stops.If you rent a car, the parking is $18 per day, in and out privileges.The location of the hotel is excellent for discovering Honolulu.If we go back we will investigate a different hotel.

<Content>The Aqua Waikiki Wave offers good value for the money. I booked this hotel, as part a vacation package after doing some research on room rates and reading reviews here. This hotel is very close to many eateries, as well as shopping, and night life. While this hotel is not an ocean front property it just a few blocks away from Waikiki Beach, although access may be slightly blocked by other properties. The decor of this hotel is seems to be modern. Our room featured a small LCD TV, but I don't know anyone who books a hotel room for the TV. Also our room featured a balcony view of the open air market below. This hotel offers a small pool that is not really anything to write about. Also the free continental is much the same and it is advised that you show up early to insure your choice of the slim pickings. Despite its faults this hotel is a good value for the money.

<Content>it's a wonderful hote!!l My wife and I go to Hawaii to spend our honeymoon. Because it is the most important trip for us, so we do a lot of research before we go there. We love Waikiki beach, and so we plan to live close with it. You know, there are a lot of hotels nearby the Waikiki beach, we spend two weeks to want to find a good one for us. We read some reviews of these hotels. Eventually we decided to live in the Aqua Waikiki Wave Hotel because of the high comments.In fact we did a very wise decision not only the comfortable condition but also the considerate service. We have a wonderful trip in there. My wife has the vertebra sickness, but she likes the pillow of Aqua Wave Hotel. We wrote down the model number of these pillows and When we came back from Hawaii, we want to find one on website. How depressed we are because these type of pillows are being out of stock. So we have to call to Aque Wave Hotel and want to buy one from there. It is unexpected that the hotel housekeeping director said they would like to mail two pillows for us and it's free!!! We could not believe that! We think these pillows are gracious gift for us. We are very grateful to the Aque Waikiki Wave Hotel and the director of housekeeping, Flora Bumanglag who mailed these pillows for us.Next time if we go to Hawaii, we will be sure to live in Aque Waikiki Wave Hotel.

<Content>Beautiful aqua waikiki wave hotel I was lucky enough to stay at the waikiki wave from the 30 April to 21 May 2008. I have worked in a 5 star hotel in New Zealand for 11 years so am very particular about hotels when I go on holiday.I am pleased to say that my expectations were met and passed at the waikiki wave. All staff I came in contact with were very professional. We had an amazing room on the 12th floor which overlooked the beautiful pink palace. The room was very spacious and always kept extremely clean. I was doubtful about booking this hotel due the remarks regarding the noise. Although we could hear the noise, when we closed the balcony doors, it shut out most of it, and we had no problems with sleeping for the whole three weeks we stayed. If you are wanting peace and quiet, you should not book a hotel in the middle of waikiki. The location of the hotel is superb, right next to the international marketplace and a five minute walk to the beach. We did not use the hotel pool, as we spent most of our days down at the beach,Thank you to Lynette for running such a superb hotel, we will definately be back for three weeks next year.

<Content>Nice reasonably priced hotel My husband and I just returned from our first trip to Hawaii. We had wanted to stay somewhere clean and reasonably priced and after reading and sorting through many, many reviews we chose the Wave. I must say that this hotel was a good choice for us - our stay was very pleasant!Our room was on the 12th floor and was a nice size, clean and comfortable. We faced the International Market and had a double balcony with a nice view of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel and Waikiki Beach in the background. We did hear noise from traffic below, as stated in other reviews, but it did not bother either of us at all. My husband can sleep through anything, and I am used to having background noise and tend to sleep with the t.v. on anyways. We liked getting the paper delivered at the door every morning. The pool was very small and in the back but we never used it. The location is close to everything. It was a short walk to Waikiki Beach and you could take a nice stroll through the Market area as a shortcut. We had rented a car and never had a problem with parking at the hotel.The only complaints we can think of would be the t.v. signal was not that good in our room - but we didn't even notify anyone about it since we hardly watched any t.v. at all; and the flourescent light in the bathroom took a few minutes to get bright. Being that we weren't looking for a luxury hotel, and didn't want to pay right on the beach prices, we were very happy with the Wave. Everyone working at the hotel had lots of Aloha and made us feel comfortable. We would definitely stay at the Wave again! Mahalo.

<Content>Loved the inside, but SEEDY neighborhood Considering all I've heard about Hawaii and its rundown hotels, I really enjoyed being inside AWW. The front desk was friendly and helpful. We talked to the concierge once, upon arrival, and she wasn't that helpful. I'll just give her the benefit of the doubt. Overall the hotel is nice inside and the location is superb. Right next to the international market, which is fun if you're into that kind of nightly commotion, and right off the main drag (don't recall that street name) so basically everything is in walking distance in Waikiki. We thought the street on the lobby side was kinda seedy. There were some adult entertainment-like stores/bars. It didn't hit us until the last day when we were waiting for our airport shuttle bus at 4am what goes on on the seedy street. It's hooker lane. And even worse, while 3 of us were waiting for the shuttle, a hooker and some guy hooked up and walked into a little alcove that was part of the hotel's property. we knew something was going on because a couple people walked by and did double takes looking in the alcove, and one group of guys even walked by again to see the action. Because of this reason alone, I do not think it should be a best value hotel rated against other hotels across the world. surely there is another hotel in waikiki that can be comparable but WITHOUT the hookers. Now, I did not walk the rest of Waikiki at 4am but I assume not all the streets are like this.

<Content>Very pleased with the Wave We stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave the second week of May. We had a room on the 8th floor. Overall we had a great stay. The room was very clean and nicely appointed. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel did provide ear plugs and we brought our own after reading the reviews. My husband did sleep with them, but Ididn't. I don't remember waking up at all from the noise. I am a pretty heavy sleeper. We had some issues with the in-room safe and they sent someone up right away to fix it. The concierge was wonderful and they didn't get tired of the millions of questions that I asked. They were so helpful. The bathroom was very dim, but it did seem to get brighter after the light was on for a while. There were large mirrors in the room, so I just used those to put on my makeup since the bathroom was dim. I loved the soaps in the bathroom. This is a minor detail, but they smelled so good - like pineapple and coconut. A nice touch. You can't beat the location of this hotel, especially for the price. We didn't rent a car and we either walked or took the bus. There are bus stops right outside. At night we just walked around and went into nearby shops, etc. The beach is just a short walk away as well. There are several places within a block that have a $2.99 breakfast. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Mirror mirror on the wall, we were disappointed of them all. My family and I stayed at the Waikiki Wave this past Memorial Day weekend for a total of 6 nights. The issues already started when we booked through Hotwire. When reading the reviews online  found out that there were noise issues, we immediately called the hotel and asked for an upgrade to a higher floor and Chris the Aqua wave representative asked me to call hotwire to get the upgrade. (I advised him that I was fine with paying the extra money for the upgrade). When we called hotwire they told me to call the hotel back and so, we were already getting the run around. We were adamant, but Hotwire work it out with Aqua Wave, so Chris noted this on my accomodations base upon availability. To make along story short, no upgrade upon check in since of course Aqua Waikiki Wave was completely booked due to Memorial day weekend. Larissa and George were not very accomodating upon check in, almost to the point of a condenscending attitude. They told us that there would be no availability until after Monday (Memorial day). One would think that they would do everything in their power to generate revenue for a guest willing to pay for an upgrade. On Monday, we asked again if there would be room availability for an upgrade and was told that they would not know until Tuesday morning when the guests have checked out. This disappointed us more since once again, why is the staff not trained enough to care about its guests and it concerns? Especially if it would of made our stay more pleasurable and we were willing to pay.Now for the noise. We were placed on the 5th floor facing the international market near the food court where the mini hawaiian dance/concerts are held. In fairness to the hotel, the only night that there was major noise was Saturday evening, and early Sunday morning when the dance clubs let out and lastly mornings when the garbage pick ups were being implemented. Being centrally located was good but, I am pleased to say that the noise factor was not as bothersome as expected.The parking situation- well the secret is go out early and get back before dinner time. One evening we did not get back early enough and had to park near by the contracted parking lots with Aqua Waikiki wave. If you do not need a car in Waikiki, do your self a favor and dont rent one either that or just rent a car for a day or two, to avoid the headache and parking fee all together. I must agree with the guest parking the slots were narrow and if you had something like a full size SUV your options would be worse. This is our 5th time on the island and have stayed with the Starwood chain hotels in the past. The room we stayed in was slightly above average in Waikiki. The bathroom did have lighting issues, we think that the bulbs the hotel uses are the new energy savers that come on rather dark until it illuminates fully. Shower and tub were not up dated as the fixtures were quite the 70's decor. The sink area was upgraded with new sink, updated fixture and granite counter tops.Finally, here are the positives. Concierge service was excellent. Michael was most helpful, super patient and very accomodating to our excursion needs. No matter how busy he was, no matter how many people were waiting and his desk phone was ringing and being alone in the morning shift when his partner was not there. He took great care to ensure that we were happy with our excursions and checked on us post the bookings to get feed back! Excellent!!! KUDOS.The house keeping staff was excellent and efficient. We requested towels and extra pillows and earplugs and for all 3 occasions not even 10 mins would go by and there would be a knock on our door with the items we requested. Even in the late evening! Our bell hop, was great! Our daughters luggage was delayed by one day and he did everything to keep a look out for the United representative to ensure that the luggage was delivered. Everyday he greeted us and offered his assistance during returning from shopping excursions.We have stayed in 5 star hotels (Ritz Carlton  Four Seasons) and 2 star hotels (Residence Inn by Marriott). All these hotels common denominator in success is their front desk staff and their willingness to ensure guests are welcomed and accomodations are fulfilled to full satisfaction. Aqua Waikiki Wave needs to take its front desk staff and send them to Customer relations classes every 6 months and invest in them. They are the front line to customers to ensure that they are up to par with ensuring 100% customer satisfaction during and post stay at their facilities. Over all, our stay was Ok a side from some problems. If the improvements noted above would be implemented then maybe we would return. I do agree with the value but, at the same time dont comprise your guests relations services.NJCAVA0122

<Content>Great Value for the Price Just returned today from a 1 week stay with my Mother and Sister to visit family on the island. The biggest reason we chose this hotel was the fact that it had large rooms available with 3 queen beds and had extremely reasonable rates (we got an awesome deal through expedia and paid around $920 per person which included fight, hotel, and taxes). The staff was wonderful and the property was above average. I stayed in room 604 which is sits above the corner of Dukes Lane and Kuhio Blvd. I have to agree with what others had posted about this hotel that it is very noisy due to its location. The first night I stayed there I was awakened by a fight occurring outside one of the bars a little after 4. I'm an extremely heavy sleeper and live in a city so I can pretty much sleep through anything. The problem is that the doors to the lanai's seen to be older and are as noise resistant as newer ones would be. The queen deluxe sweet I was in actually had a separate little bedroom with a sliding wooden door which was pretty neat. This was by far the noisiest part of the room though. The window in that portion of the room was extremely old and would not close properly so at night it was as if the window was wide open and you could hear everything. The bathroom was a little small but was sufficient. A little hint about the lighting in the bathroom. When you first turn the lights on in the bathroom the lighting is extremely dim. You have to let the lights warm up and brighten. We just didn't turn the bathroom light off so it just stayed bright. That is about all the negatives I have. The hotel beds in my opinion were pretty comfortable. The room was huge with a mini-fridge and microwave. There were two LCD TV's in the room neither of which we really used. The decor was very nice as well. The hotel is in a good spot. It is less than a 10 minute walk to Waikiki Beach and all of the shopping. The Ala Moana Shopping Mall shuttle stop across the street. The fitness center was pretty decent for a small hotel. The staff was very helpful as well. I'm not sure if I would stay again unless I traveled with my mother and sister again and would need the 3 beds. I personally like to be right on the beach. If you use your hotel as a home base and hop around the island this is a great location though. There are several car rental locations on Seaside avenue and it is actually cheaper to just rent the car for the day street park it overnight (free from 6pm - 8 am) and return it in the morning rather than paying $20 a night to park. Overall, for the purpose of my trip this was a perfect location. If the noise wasn't an issue I really would not have any complaints at all. I should have mentioned the window in 604 to the staff but I was always running around and it kept slipping my mind.

<Content>Aloha Spirit Reigns The staff of the Aqua Waikiki Wave are all like Ohana (family) and they treat everyone who stays at this beautiful hotel like Ohana ... from the moment we checked in, we felt welcomed. George at the front desk was our 1st person contact, he is very pleasant, welcoming and informative. George was right on with his suggestions for restaurants and etc. for us. Larissa, also at the front desk was pleasant, welcoming. James, followed suit with George and Larissa. Housekeeping staff member - Florida kept our beautiful room clean and nice throughout our stay. Due to Aqua Waikiki Wave's close proximity to everything, it is the ideal location to stay in, whether on foot or just considering this time of high fuel prices. Less then a block from the International Marketplace and the International Food Court . Much closer, due to being on property, are the Big Kauhuna restaurant and the Hawaiian Beachwear shop and it's pleasant shop owner - Kim, the shopping and eating experiences were all quite fun and convenient. We will stay at Aqua Waikiki Wave again  again!

<Content>Reviews spot on -- it is great The Aqua Wave was great. Our family stayed there for two weeks in a Deluxe Suite (3 Queen beds). The room was very spacious. It was well decorated and very clean. The beds were very comfortable with high quality bedding. Location is about a block and a half to the main beach area -- a bit of a walk with all the beach gear and kids in tow. However, it is handy to good restaurants and bus transport. The reviews we read prior to booking warned about noise. These were accurate --- noise from rubbish trucks in the morning and from the International Marketplace performances in the evening were a bit of a nuisance. But with kids, we were up early anyway! The cooking smells from the International Marketplace (our room was on that side of the building) were an unexpected downside. Staff were friendly throughout our stay. The hotel has no laundary but there is a coin laundary located in easy walking distance. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Fabulous hotel!!!! Oustanding Value for Money!!! My friend and I stayed at the AWW from May 1-9 and had a great experience. We booked this hotel based on the reviews on his site and we were not disappointed! This is a great place to stay. Fantastic location close to everything - beach was a 5 minute walk, public transport right at the door and plenty of shops, restaurants, cafes and fast food places nearby.Our room was lovely, modern and clean with plenty of space and the most comfy beds!! It was great to have all those little extras you sometimes pay for at pricier hotels like wi-fi, safe, iron, hairdryer and free daily newspaper. The fridge, microwave and coffee maker were also a nice inclusion.The complimentary continental breakfast consisting of pastries, oatmeal, fresh fruit, juices, tea and coffee was great at getting us started for the day and the free coffee in the lobby was also a great touch.This hotel has the friendliest, most obliging staff!! Everyone we came into contact with had a great spirit and their warmth and helpfulness made our stay so special.Our room was on the 9th floor and while we did hear some noise it wasn't unbearable. It usually dies down after 10pm. I'm a light sleeper and I had no trouble falling asleep. Don't let this deter you from staying here.Overall, this hotel is outstanding value for money for the price we paid. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Aloha spirit lives @ the Wave Coming to Oahu for business for last 4 years... was referred to hotel by brother in law (also business traveler) ... was sorry we didnt learn of Waikiki Wave sooner!The staff and Mgmt teams are filled with the Aloha Spirit.The hotel is located in the heart of Waikiki behind Intl Mrkt Plc. On-site parking available.The hotel has been undergoing upgrades and transforming an dated property to an up to date boutique hotel with great amenities. Complimentary WiFi is a must these days ... Fitness room is well equipped ... mini kitchen (micro/frige/coffee) very convenient, are all provided.Beds are no less than queen/king sizes ... and they even provide earplugs for the light sleeper (they are in the midst of all the Waikiki action). This may concern some people ... but it is a small price of noise for location. The view from the lanai varies from room to room. The higher the room the better the view. Location directly between 2 landmark hotels of Waikiki (Royal Hawaiian  Moana Hotel ... 1st two hotels on Waikiki Beach)Overall, the staff, amenities, location make up for the slight imperfections of the centrally located Waikiki hotel. The Aqua owners are doing very well for vacationers  business travelers.

<Content>Disappointing experience This hotel is overrated.We've just got back from our trip to Hawaii. We stayed at Aqua Waikiki Wave for 4 nights and I'm not sure if I would come back to this hotel again. The bathroom was very small, it was not clean and needed some repairs. The toilet bowl had nasty stains inside. The toilet seat was chipping and needed to be replaced. The shower curtain was stinky. My relatives were in another room and they also had problems with their bathroom. There was a leak in the shower that never got repaired even after the maintenance staff tried to fix it. Their bathroom was too dark because of a problem on the light.The parking garage is horrible. They only have a few spaces available and you have to squeeze your car in one of the tiny spaces to fit it in.They give complimentary ear plugs... Oh well, I wish they didn't have to do it at all! I did hear some people complaining about the noise but fortunately we didn't have problems with it.There was no complimentary breakfast.Even though they have good rates and excellent location, I'd rather stay at Aqua Palms  Spa in Ala Moana for almost the same price but much better service and nicer rooms.FYI, if you book a room on Aqua Hotels website, look for the Special Rates link on the botton of the page. They give a discount for military, AAA members.

<Content>Awesome place to stay!! This is not a large hotel but, it is newly renovated and a VERY SHORT walk to the beach. Your hotel is right next to the international marketplace. I would urge you to stay here. It is much less expensive than being directly on the beach but, it is so close it doesn't even matter!! We took our 3 children with us and they loved it. Very comfy beds w/down pillows and comforters. Very clean facilities. Swimming pool (I didn't even go to the pool) who needs one when the beach is so close. I hope I have helped you make a decision on where to stay. I know I was scared to death about traveling there and not knowing anything about this hotel. STAY HERE!! It was awesome.

<Content>Was pleased I would go back..... clean room, not to expencive, right in waikiki, not to far from the beach. I stayed here for two weeks and enjoyed it very much. I have stayed in many hotels ranging from the Rits Carlton in Chicago, to the Econo lodge in Auburn Maine. This hotel was very nice and fit my needs pretty well. If I ever get the chance to make it back to Oahu, the Wave will probably be the first hotel that I check for a room.

<Content>Very nice hotel My wife and I stayed here for the first part of our first visit to Hawaii in September of 2007, and were pleasantly surprised. It doesn't really stick out from the street, just a small sign advertises it. I like the aquarium behind the front desk, made for a nice touch. The staff was very friendly, and we were able to upgrade to a higher floor room cheaply to avoid street noise. I appreciated the fast elevators, and the room wasn't the best I've ever been in, but was still very nice and clean. Especially liked the welcoming basket of treats waiting for us. Street noise was not a problem, we had no trouble getting to sleep at night. While not on the beach, it isn't a long walk at all. Took at most 10 minutes to get to Waikiki Beach, and less to hit the main street full of shops and restaurants. Overall we had absolutely no complaints about our stay, and would easily stay here again.

<Content>We are definitly going back to The Waikiki Wave My husband and I have been going to Waikiki for anniversary every year for the last 21 yrs. This year, we consider our visit to be the best!Why you ask?? Because of our hotel experience.Needless to say, we have been in many hotels over the years some good, some terrible. Our stay in the Aqua Waikiki Wave was Simply The Best! The Aqua Waikiki Wave is in the heart of Waikiki, close to everything.The International Market Place, Shopping, Transit System and that all important element of a tropical holiday, the beach!The rooms are nicely decorated with a good floor plan with plenty of space.The most important feature is service that cannot be beat, from the bellboy to reception, we could not have asked for more. Everyone wentout of their way to make us feel at home and we did.If your thinking of a holiday in Waikiki choose the Aqua Waikiki Wave. I will be your best bet to ensure an excellant experience.Joanne and Ron Parkinson Qualicum Beach BC Canada

<Content>Very Overrated! Going into my stay, I was expecting a great experience based on all of the good reviews that I read. Unfortunately, my stay there was VERY disappointing. The worst part about the hotel is the NOISE ALL NIGHT LONG! I stayed on the 12th floor and was still woken up multiple times during the night with street noise. You know it's not a good sign when they supply a pair of earplugs in the room to help combat the noise.Don't waste your time with this place - stay down the street at the Wyland Waikiki instead.PROS:- Very comfortable bed- Cheaper parking than many of the other hotels in the area- Good locationCONS:- If you book on their web site, a continental breakfast IS NOT INCLUDED- Terrible lighting in the bathroom- No TV in the suite bedroom- Extremely small TV in the living area with horrible channel reception- Very loud street noise during the night- Shower drained incredibly slowly - by the end it looked like I had filled it for a bath

<Content>Excellent Value Stayed in the Jr. Suite with partial ocean view. Excellent room, large, good view, clean. Located on the 15th floor. The area is very noisy so for those travelers that need complete quiet this is not the place to stay. Sitting on the balcony I could hear the stage entertainment from the International Market Place below very clearly. I found that closing the balcony doors eliminated most of the noise. I'm sure that staying on the upper floors helped reduce the noise from the surrounding area. Earplugs were provided but I didn't need them. Visiting Oahu from Maui for a one day business trip so it was a very brief stay at the hotel. The only contact with the staff was during check in and out and they were very nice. I will stay at this hotel again...on the upper floors. Recommended.

<Content>Good hotel We stayed there for 5 days and 4 nights and we had a good experience. We were on the 4th floor with windows opening up to the East. The lower floors facing this direction do not have a view since there is a parking lot about 5 stories here.A few things to point out:The front desk checks out beach towels to guests.The hotel is a 5 minutes walk from the beach, and there are plenty to see.Elevators are terribly slow.The hotel owned parking lot is a bit small. There is a different parking lot next to the hotel operated by someone else, but if you are paying for hotel parking, you can park there for free.Overall the hotel was clean, the reception staff was friendly and the concierge in particular were awesome! There is a business center with printer so very convenient. I enjoyed my stay and will go back there again in my future visits.

<Content>Once again a fantastic experience In April 2007 I was in Waikiki with a girlfriend for a week long shopping holiday! The accommodation we had was terrible and after a few days i checked myself out and booked into the Aqua Wave as it was one of te only places left with accommodation due to Spring break. The service and staff were outstanding for the 3 days when I was there, and so when my boyfriend and I booked a trip back to Hawaii this year i had no doubt in my mind where i wanted to stay! The rooms are clean and spacious, and they also have great ammenities like tv, microwave, fridge and coffee maker, not to mention the DVD player. We had a great time, made even more enjoyable by the freindly and knowledgable staff both on the front and tour desks. I would highly recommend this hotel as it is central to everything. There are bars and nightclubs close by, you are next door to the International Markets and 1 block from the beach! We loved our stay here and have recommended our freinds and family to stay there whenever they are in Waikiki!

<Content>Good Location, Great Service! Group of us (10) stayed March 18th to 21st 2008. We enjoyed the Waikiki Wave very much. We were on the 15th floor that had great views of the city and a bit of the ocean. Maybe one of the fastest elevators we have used, very nice. No noise issues at all from up there, slept great, the beds were very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and courteous. I even got a tip on parking from one of the staff which was very helpful. Close to everything you need. Bakery right next door has great pasteries! We travel a lot and if you look and try hard enough you can find the bad in anything.We always ignore people that look for the worse. Everone we met and talked with that were staying at the Wave seemed to all having a great time. One of the 'working girls approached my uncle one night with the line Are you looking for me? We all used that line the rest of our Hawaiian holiday...lol! Bottom line, good value and we will be back again. Thanks

<Content>More Good than Bad When we booked this hotel, we weren't aware of its previous identity (The Coral Reef) where we had stayed once before - a huge mistake. We read the reviews of the Wave hotel post-renovation, and decided to take the chance. Our party of 4 adults have now just returned from a week-long stay at The Wave, and we must say, with a couple of exceptions, it was a nice experience.Upon check-in, they comp'd us an upgrade to our room from a 2-queen deluxe suite to their largest 3-queen Aloha suite (one bed in a separate area with a sliding door), which set a nice tone for our stay. The room was good-sized, with comfortable beds, nice flat-screen TVs and stylish furnishings. The bathroom, although small, worked, and was standardly outfitted. We immediately saw the need for additional towels, called housekeeping, and had our delivery within 10 minutes. All staff we dealt with were friendly and very willing to help in any way they could. They stored our luggage on two occasions, with absolutely no problems.So, here are the cons - not a long list, and most of which seem easily remedied by the hotel, which makes you wonder why they don't fix the ones they can (wouldn't you want better reviews?):1. LOCATION - this is a colorful and very loud part of town (nothing they can do about this), making parking questionable (although close and relatively convenient), and strolling the area pretty interesting. The after-hours activity made for some sleepless hours. 2. WINDOWS IN ROOM - as a result of #1, we noticed immediately that it seemed so loud in our 9th floor room that we assumed the windows/sliding doors were open. We confirmed on many occasions that they weren't. The window in the small room seemed especially poorly-insulated or installed. We were on the 9th floor, and it seemed like traffic and voices were directly outside our window.3. SLAMMING DOORS - our room was positioned at the end of a hallway, adjacent to the door to the stairwell. This door, which was frequently used, had no slowing mechanism on it, and slammed very loudly when shutting. We were awakenened out of a dead sleep many times every night as a result. This seems like such an easy fix...?4. BATHROOM FAN (or lack thereof) - as stated above, the bathroom was small, but for one person it worked fine...except that the steam from the shower had nowhere to go, so the room was steamy forever after a shower due to the absence of an exhaust fan. We were traveling with friends, making leaving the door open not so much of an option. Another easy fix...?5. PILLOWS - this could merely be personal taste, but as comfortable as the beds were, the pillows were just as uncomfortable. They were too firm and foamy for our taste. As we were checking out and awaiting our airport shuttle, we spoke with a lady who was on day 3 of her week-long stay at this hotel. She had the very same complaints we did, but also said that overall it was a good value at a decent hotel. We concur 100%. If you're looking for a beautiful view in a serene location, this is not it. However, if you travel like we do, and don't spend that much time in the hotel, this is a good value.Oh...I almost forgot...they do provide one set of earplugs in the room. We're certain they would bring additional sets for everyone. We would recommend this option if you're into sleeping.

<Content>Aqua Waikiki Wave. We had a one day stopover in Waikiki. We decided to stay at the Aqua Wave Hotel. We are glad we did. From the moment we booked the property right through to when we checked out the experience was VERY good. We found all the staff to be very helpful and courteous. The room we had was very nice and suited our needs wonderfully. The Hotel also has a great location in Waikiki. With the International Market place right next door, and the beach not to far away. We found the business centre to be very good as well.We'll be back for sure, longer next time.

<Content>Great Hospitality! We just returned from a five night trip to Oahu and spent those nights at the Waikiki Wave. Athough the hotel is obviously older, the rooms were clean and attractive. And we never heard a peep from neighboring rooms. But the best part about our stay was the service at the front desk. Josh, in particular, was there to attend to our every need, and Darryl was very helpful and friendly as well. It's obvious the staff is carefully chosen to reflect the Aloha Spirit that we were served with at the Waikiki Wave Hotel.Mahalo, Josh and Darryl!

<Content>Mixed Review We booked as part of a package with Hawaiian Airlines. Upon arrival to the hotel, they didn't have our reservation on file. After a few minutes, it was explained that Hawaiian had booked us for next month (which seemed strange, since they booked our airline for that day, but whatever). The front desk staff were very nice and gave us a room category upgrade (which, all that means is instead of being on the 2nd floor we were put on the 9th floor) and complimentary breakfast coupons. Our room was exactly what you see in the pictures - nicely decorated, small TV, fridge  micro (a nice plus for storing leftovers  drinks). We hit up their breakfast the next morning and it is pathetic. They had a tray of croissants, a tray of mini-muffins and a fruit bowl. Pretty lame, considering there are several restaurants in the area offering cheap breakfasts (probably to compete against lame hotel breakfasts that are free). My other major issue with this hotel is the pool. Even the bellman referred to it as their bathtub. There is no access from inside the hotel. It is accessed by going down into the parking garage and out the backside into an alley. The pool is up some stairs and fenced in chain-link with blue plastic privacy slats. It looks like someplace you'd find the dumpster and it butts up to the backside of the food court of the International Marketplace. I never saw anybody using it. The other main turn-off to this hotel is its location. It is not on the main strip - Kalakaua Blvd and it is not on the beach. We found ourselves walking at least quarter mile each way to the beach. We wasted so much time walking back and forth getting cleaned up for lunch, dinner, etc. It was a major pain in the [-].This hotel would be fine if you are in town on business or don't plan on partaking in any of Waikiki's attractions. But if you are looking for a Hawaiian experience, I would steer clear. If we go back to Waikiki, we'll be staying at the ResortQuest Waikiki Beach.

<Content>We Loved the Aqua Waikiki Wave We loved the Aqua Waikiki Wave! When we called into the reservations line for Aqua Hotels we were greeted with a very friendly and helpful agent. She ended up getting us a great deal and upgraded us. Once we arrived at the hotel the staff were great as well, very quick and friendly check in process. Our room was very clean and had recently been updated, very nice. The pictures online are exact. The beds were very comfortable and had beautiful white comforters/bedding. The view was great since we were on the 11th floor. We had a view of the ocean on one corner of the patio and the city  mountains on the other :). Beautiful! I had read that some guests complained about noise however we did not have an issue and actually found the hotel to be quite quiet. Yes you will hear the odd noise from other guests but nothing to complain about. The patio doors kept the noise from outside out of the room. The location is perfect! About 2-3 blocks from the beach. Very close to great shopping! A fave was Muse that had just opened 2 weeks ago and was directly accross the street. Upscale shops are along the beach. The International Market is literally next door to the hotel. The market has a food court and unique to Hawaii shops and kiosks. It, of course, has an ABC Store for convenience however you will find ABC Stores every half block in Waikiki!! (ABC Stores have everything you need as a traveller.) The hotel is located very close to many restaurants that have great deals for breakfast ($2.99 breakfasts to be exact for your simple eggs/toast/bacon etc). It's great for the budget traveller. There are many happy hour specials that serve $1.00 - $3.00 drinks! The hotel itself is great for all types of travellers. Great for families and singles / couples alike. The small pool is not in a good location however. It is accessed through the parkade and kind of in a back alley between 2 tall buildings - no sun. Very weird. The hotel might as well not have a pool at all really! :) HOWEVER this would be our only complaint and we didn't even want to swim in the pool anyway since you're in Hawaii for the ocean! The ocean swimming and waves are better by far. Towel service is offered at the front desk for the beach as a sign in / sign out. They were very nice about the fact that our towels were covered in sand and sea water! : ) Shuttle service to and from the airport is easy. $9.00 per person. or a taxi would be about $40.00 if you have a family for more than 3 people. We used Reliable Shuttle but there are many others with a simular price point.  Overall our stay was excellent! We recommend it to everyone!Any of the Aqua resorts seem great on their websites.

<Content>Great location, staff, price, .... The hotel was only satisfactory in terms of the renovations. I had the impression that the place was gutted from top to bottom, including the washrooms, but it was just a paint cover up. The staff, location, and price were the best on the island. Any problems or needs, the hotel staff was there immediately to help. Thanks to Larisa, George, Chris, and Kristyn for their excellent service. I hope they get bonus pay for their service. The weekday room cleaning staff needs to pick up her act, the weekend part-timers did a way better in cleaning the room and even left us coffee each day. We had 12th floor rooms for 10 days and really have no complaints. I would definitely book another stay with this hotel.

<Content>Great value We had a great experience at this hotel! The hotel rooms are beautifully renovated, staff was very friendly and helpful. there were 2 minor negatives; the pool is very small - however we were at the beach each day and used the pool for a post beach dip! There is a fair amount of street activity at night, there appeared to be no issue with safety it is more an irritation than an problem.For the money it is a great value in my opinion. As a business traveller who stays in hotels about 35 weeks a year I would recommend!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Stayed a week at the Aqua Waikiki Wave Hotel to chill out after returning from a 10 night cruise around the Hawaiian Islands. The hotel lived up to and far exceeded the comments made by other travellers on Trip Advisor. We arrived very early for our check-in and Rachael at Reception went out of her way to get our room ready. We had a room on the 14th Floor with ocean views. The room was big, everything you needed was there and it had the most comfortable beds we had ever slept in. The Aqua Waikiki Wave hotel is not a five star hotel, however it is a lovely hotel worth spending your vacation. It is filled with staff that care about their guests.We would definitely stay at the Wave again, 100% satisfied. It is a short stroll to the beach. Several stores and restaurants are very close to the hotel. Local phone calls, free safe, daily newspaper and continental breakfast is included as well as supplying towels for the beach.Thankyou Lynette and your staff for their hospitality!

<Content>Was I in the same place as all of you? The Aqua Waikiki Wave is relatively inexpensive. We could just stop there.I've usually agree with Trip Advisor reviews and am left wondering how I could feel they were so off the mark. Perhaps Honolulu is more of a student market, and so expectations are different?I'm not normally a Four Seasons-type of woman or anything. I just had gotten the wrong impression from the reviews: this is a 50s-era hotel that has had a light face-lift. Boutique? I don't think so. The furniture is attractive but the carpet is old and BAD. The screen on the bedroom window was falling off. The hallways were low-quality (though interior) Motel 6: old, smelly, no real attempt to make them attractive at all. I felt, well, as though I was in a 1950s very cheap hotel.Everything was clean, the price was great, but we Pricelined a four-star hotel the next night and ended up at the Waikiki Prince for maybe $20 more and it was a WORLD of difference. If you're in the market for a clean, absolutely cheap, old hotel, this is the place.

<Content>Noisy Hotel with Squishy Beds After reading reviews on TripAdvisor, I thought this hotel would be okay for a week. Wrong! The location was okay - very central - and as people said, the working girls come out at night along this strip of Kuhio Ave. That didn't bother me and they certainly aren' agressive so I think having your children along would be fine (unless you are trying to shelter them from the realities of the world). What bothered me most was the noise. I mean, it was really noisy. I could hear the noise through the earplugs that I slept with. So noisy! I can't figure out why they didn't double pane the windows. Such an easy solution to the noise problem. My other complaints are that the beds were too squishy and we never got really hot water for a shower. The beds, I could tell, were on the new side but just way too soft. I woke up with a sore lower back every morning. How lovely to come home to my nice firm mattress. The shower never got more than lukewarm and was usually more like luke-cool. Come on folks! The hotel should have a water heater system large enough to handle the hotel at it's maximum capicity. And one other thing, the tub spigot was falling out of the wall. On the plus side, the room was attractively decorated and the staff were very nice but I would not return or recommend the Wave. There are much better options in Waikiki.

<Content>Great Value - Good Location Pros: - Great central Waikiki location close to everything. Beach is a short stroll through International Marketplace  the Outrigger. Multiple dining options within walking distance. Plenty of shops and close to all the dinner shows. - Clean remodeled rooms and bath. Convenient mini-fridge, coffemaker,  microwave. Nice lobby.- Satisfactory to Good service - front desk, maid, etc. - no issues.- Reasonable rates for Waikiki.Cons:- Noisy location if light sleeper - especially on the Saturday night we stayed.- Tight limited parking - Some larger parking spots but they can fill up fast. First night parked in a tiny spot - difficult time getting out of car. I ended up waiting for a good spot the next morning and taking the Bus for remainder of stay.- Lack of bathroom counterspaceCannot comment on fitness room or pool (did not use).Overall the hotel is a great value for the location. The parking and noise issues are kind of beyond the control of the hotel. They also try their best to remedy the situations like providing reimbursements for parking at nearby lots. You may get a good rental car rate but remember to add parking to that cost if staying in Waikiki. This hotel parking was $20/night. Next time in Waikiki I will definitely consider not renting a car at all. The Bus was only $2 and very reliable.

<Content>Very Very pleased As soon as you arrive you are greeted at your cab by the polite friendly staff at Waikiki Wave. Our bags were carried up the front steps and even though we were early they found us a room below the floor we had booked as it was ready and we checked in.The beds were lovely and comfy, bathroom clean and service of the room was regular and excellent.Every staff member we met had a friendly greeting at anytime of day. The hotel is perfectly placed, with a secure entrance at night, and wheelchair lift outside which I was impressed to see.There is a gym, and breakfast facilities. The hotel is a very short walk through the market to the beach and seemed to have lots of families staying there so is very kid friendly. The business centre provided use of the internet which was handy.I could not fault this hotel, they even let my friends transfer from a sub standard hotel which they were very disappointed with and found them a great room, even over the busy Easter period.I would definately book here again. 100% satisfied. Thankyou Waikiki Wave.

<Content>Not Bad At All We booked our stay from 3/17-3/23/2008. I travel a lot for work and am pretty picky about where I stay, but didn't really have any complaints. Please keep in mind that this is not a five star hotel that extremely pampers their guests (i.e. Ritz Carlton, Beverly Hills Hilton, Four Seasons, etc.), but a hotel that offers a little more than the basic for comfort at a reasonable price. We originally had booked with Hilton Hawaiian Village, as I am an HHonors Gold Member but felt that it was a bit too pricey (base rate of $270-$300) given the construction activity still in progress and distance from the more active Waikiki areas. After reading about Aqua Wave being newly renovated, cross-referencing reviews with other sources, and checking out the rates for our stay, we took the chance and changed from HHV to Aqua Wave. Plus we figured that we鈥檇 be out and about majority of the time anyway.I admit that we were a bit discouraged by the constant mention of street noise and *ladies* hanging around on the street in front of the hotel. But we booked rooms on the upper floors (15th floor) and didn't really hear anything that kept us from sleeping. I did see a few females on occasion outside the hotel, but they did not appear to be actively marketing themselves. For all I know they just could have been dressed to go clubbing given that they didn't dress too differently from the out-of-town girls who were ready to party. Actually, I had to point it out to my fiance who didn't even notice them.The hotel is close to everything and is on the same block as two ABC stores, Starbucks, and Jamba Juice. The room themselves are fairly big and they do look like the pictures. We had two queen (king?) beds, which were very comfortable, microwave, and mini-fridge. The bathroom is on the small side, but this is typically the norm with older hotels when compared to newer hotels across the US. The availability/speed of the elevators depends on the time of day. With only two elevators, you can expect a longer wait in the mornings, when everyone is leaving for the day's activities. Staff was nice, but didn't really rely on them so I can't say too much about them. The free breakfast is on the 1st floor, but we never tried it so I can't comment on that either. The parking lot is cramped and does get full in the evening/nights and costs about $18-$20. If it's full, they'll direct you to another parking company (cars parked by attendant via lift in various 'slots' located right before hotel's parking lot entrance) where the parking fee is waived. We found out that it's actually cheaper to just park it with them directly for $10 for over night parking (no in-and-out). We only have 2 minor complaints: (1) There is no ramp for rolling luggage. Although it鈥檚 not a long flight of stairs, we still had to lug our heavy suitcases up when we arrived and back down when we checked out. We did not look at all graceful doing this. But there is a lift to the side of the stairs for the handicap. (2) The hotel room doors do not have anything on the hinges to slow it down and stop it from slamming. We just had to catch the door to prevent it. So I guess the only noise complaint I have would be the slamming of doors when guests left early in the morning or got back late at night. But overall, we're happy with our decision to switch reservations and would book here again as long as the room and staff quality remains similar.

<Content>Even better than last time I stayed at the Wave last year in March and came back to stay there this time as well. First of all, its a great location, about a block from the beach with plenty of places to eat nearby and an ABC store about 100 feet away. Also the bus stop is right near by as well to take you to Diamond Head. There is a great little pastrie place, St. Germaine's next door as well. This place got even better this visit. They now offer free breakfast (mostly fruit, oatmeal, and pastries), but enough to get you started for the day. The room was always clean and its nicely designed, everything looks brand new. It is a little noisy, but I don't know if that is just a function of staying there on St. Patricks Day both years. They also offer towel check-out for the beach and the staff is always friendly. Their doorman/bellhop, Brian is always helpful, smiling and friendly. He always makes sure guests are getting what they need while waiting for their airport shuttle or tourist pick-up. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>OK, but noisy We booked this hotel based on reviews from Trip Advisor. This is the first time I am somewhat disappointed in the reviews.We spent 2 nights at this hotel in Room 401(Deluxe King Room). We had a view of the parking garage across the street. I got concerned when I found hotel supplied ear plugs on the dresser. The room was clean and large but backed the elevator bays, thus noisy. The street noise was also quite loud. The staff was very friendly. Keep in mind this is not an Hawaiian resort hotel but a city hotel as you are 2 blocks from the beach.

<Content>Great Location Hotel is in a great location, right in the centre of town and right near the beach. Rooms were of a good size and condition. Very freindly and efficient staff and best of all was the value for money given the price of other hotels in the area.I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Very Disappointed We were a group of 7 couples who stayed at this hotel. For starters, we were promised a coupon book that had a coupon for a 2 for 1 luau. We had to ask for the book and there was no 2 for 1 luau in there. When we asked, about it, the staff had no idea what we were talking about. We were also told there would be a weekly cocktail party. We never saw that. The continental breakfast was the worse one I have ever seen. Not even cold cereal or english muffins, or plain bread. and it is only open from 7:30am to 9:30am. There are two elevators and they are very slow. On our last day only one was working. Most of the staff was very nice . One even took us down in the employee elevator since we had our luggage. This place charges to use the internet so we printed our boarding passes at the airport. They say they have a pool but you have to walk through a dark alley and up a flight of stairs to get to it. Needless to say we didn't use it. Our room was clean, very noisy at night. The bathroom was very small with very dim lighting. We didn't receive any extras as another guest stated he got razor, shaving cream, etc. We just got the usual shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion. Again I will say most of the staff were very friendly and always smiling.

<Content>Beware Bed Bugs Infestation This hotel was a absoulte disgrace. We discovered bed bugs the second night of our stay. When we contacted reception they did not seemed surprised and placed us in one of their higher end hotels promising a full refund. When we return the next morning to confirm these arrangements with a hotel manager we where informed that someone looked into the manner and there was no sight of a bed bug infestation. This was at 8.30 in the morning we checked out at 11 that night. There is no way they could have had professional in there first thing. To make matters worse they refused to refund us for the whole stay as promised (only the last night when we discovered the bed bugs). Once we looked at our bank statements they did not refund us for the night of the bed bugs stay and actually charged us for movie entertainment that we did not request.This place is horrible!

<Content>Great Hotel! We spent 3 nights at the Wave March 1st to 4th and came away very impressed. We are seasoned travellers and have stayed at many hotels around the world and can easily recommend the Wave. My only caution is that my Wife and I like smaller hotels and if you are looking for a mega resort on the water, this is not your place.The room was clean and well furnished. We had a Junior Suite on the 14th floor that had a King and a Queen bed with two balconies with a view of the ocean. Also, it had probably the greatest shower I have ever encountered in any hotel. (We stayed at a high priced resort on business on the big island right after this and the shower was not nearly as good) The staff was courteous and very friendly. They went out of their way to make our stay very pleasant.The hotel is in a great location in the middle of everything and a block and a half from the water. Ok now to the concerns others have laid out here:Noise: We realized that this was a big city location and a certain amount of noise comes with that. If you want silence you have to book a room in the country. That said, we slept with our windows open but had to close them at 4 am both Saturday and Sunday nights, the first for when the bars let out and the second night because of the garbage truck in the alley. This did not bother us at all. With the windows closed it was quiet and the hotel provided earplugs in our room if we needed more. We had friends who stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on the water and had noise issues as well. They were not happy when they found out that we paid half of what they did and they had a view of a roof.Hookers: My radar may not be as well tuned as say an Elliot Spitzer, but we did not see any hookers. We were not out late on Saturday as it was our first night in and the nights we did come in late were Sunday and Monday nights.Tour operator: Did not use him. We did make one mistake. We took a cab to Pearl Harbor spending about $40 one way and then found that there is a van service that will pick you up and drop you off at your hotel for about $9 each way. Lesson learned.Pool: Did not use, the ocean is a block away!Overall our experience was very good and we would recommend it to our friends.One more tip. The Shereton has a bar on the water called Rum Fire. We watched the sunset from there every night. It has a great view and has fire pits and couches for a late night drink.

<Content>Very nice Hotel Very nice hotel. Although most things were up to date the hotel bathrooms seemed a bit dated. Staff was very friendly and helpful. It was nice to have the Juice and muffins in the morning. Very close to everything. Although it didn't bother us much, it is very noisy with the night life outside. They did provide the earplugs but again, we were usually so tired we slept fine through the night.

<Content>caution unscrupulous in house tour operator the Aqua is beautiful, their service and staff first rate! the rooms are clean and beautiful, and the hotel well located. the entire atmosphere is perfect, but BEWARE the in house tour operator, Lahaina Hawaii Tours - they are always late, make you sign endless contracts about additional fees, etc. and then offer mostly bait and switch operations. one example - a tour of ancestral ruins and a breakfast that turns into a visit to ancestral ruins and a breakfast at a time share opportunity: when you refuse the realestate lecture, you are charged $100 for the tour...we all know, admission to places like the Louvre and Disneyland don't even cost $100! they have also turned away singles and widows, stating that the time share opportunity can only be extended to couples, and they also use that opportunity to charge you...what a SHAME! because the Aqua Waikiki Wave is so wonderful otherwise!

<Content>Best Value I usually stay at the Resort Quest Waikiki Beach Hotel but the room rates went up to $200 a night minimum. I found the Aqua Wave Hotel on Trip Advisor and ended up booking the room right on the Aqua website because they were the only ones who had the Partial Ocean View option. I used the corporate rate (just showed my business card upon arrival) and got an Partial Ocean View room which was on the top floor (15th) half facing the ocean and half facing diamond head for only $108 a night! I was very happy with my stay. I picked the Wave property over the other Aqua resorts because of the new modern decor. Room had an LCD TV and new style linens and decorations. I liked that the hotel was located in the International Market Place and accross from Dukes which is one of my favorite beach hang out spots. Negatives about the stay were that the business center charged for internet access (even to just print boarding pass), lighting in bathroom was very dim, and the TV was very small (if I had to guess I'd say 25). The room was very clean, bathroom was a nice size, large closet space, and all basic amenities were included (even toothbrush, saving cream, rasor) free of charge. For the price I paid, it was well worth it.

I have to agree with the other posts though, the noise is outrageous and the ear plugs they leave beside your bed don't help. Also, one day our room wasn't cleaned until 5:30 p.m. and we had to call twice to get towels so we could shower and go for dinner.

<Content>Great service, good location We had a good time in Waikiki. I had not been there for almost 30 yrs. The Aqua wave hotel is only a block and a half fromt he beach. The service was great. Our 3 year old ended up with one of the staff members tied around her finger and everytime James W. saw her he had a little something for, and once a big something. The Chinese resturant in the hotel has fast service and VERY good food. We will very definitely come back to the Wave. Our time there made up for the not so nice time we had in Kona.

<Content>Great value, friendly service Gave great value for money. We booked a standard double/double room on the lower levels but on arrival seemed to be upgraded to a higher level room. We were apprehensive about the noise level as we had heard that Waikiki could be very noisy (especially at night), but on level 8 we were high enough to not notice it, even with the door open to the balcony. The staff were all really friendly and willing to help with directions, luggage, etc. The decor really impressed for the price - the hotel seemed to have been newly renovated at some recent stage so everything was nice, clean and comfortable. Best of all - the room appeared exactly the same as the pictures on the website! Location was also very good - a few blocks from the beach but if you take the short cut it ends up being less than 5 mins. Only negative is late at night, there are dodgy people on the main street - but that's just Waikiki at night.Would definitely recommend this hotel and would return next time I'm in town.

<Content>My wife forgot to mention the hookers my wife wrote the review below and forgot to mention that hookers were cruising the street in front of the hotel entrance at night and I'm not talking about one or two, there were several! Now I realize the hotel has no control over this, but it may be a consideration travelers with families. Especially those with teenagers who may want to go shopping in the evening.To the credit of the hotel staff, the entrance was safe guarded quite well and they were all helpful and courteous to the guests.

<Content>Room was filthy and noisy! Yuck! After reading all the wonderful reviews online I chose to stay a couple nights at the Waikiki Wave. I was disappointed to find my room was directly across from the elevator (noisy) and it had noise coming from nearby nightclubs, so my husband immediately requested another. We were told that no others were available except the same location on a different floor. Then as I started looking around the room more, I noticed that counters and tables were dusty, had water rings and smears as if they had not been cleaned. When I found the same on the bathroom counter I was thoroughly disgusted. I am not a clean freak, but I do expect counters to be wiped down between guests. I stopped looking afraid of what I would find next if I continued. If we had been planning to stay more than 2 nights in Waikiki we would have moved. I will definitely not be staying there again!On a positive note, staff were friendly.

<Content>Moved to Waikiki Marriott After 3 Nights No Sleep The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean. But the noise at night from the nearby clubs is outragously loud. If your room has a view of the parking garage next door like ours did, be prepared for a lot of screeching tires and yelling of partygoers from midnight to 4 am. You must also prepare yourself for the garbage trucks that remove trash from the Int'l Marketplace before sunrise every morning. And last, the pool is a nightmare surrounded by a chain link fence over the dumpsters of the Marketplace. This is not the Hawaii that I want to vacation in. We transfered to the Waikiki Marriott and felt like we'd just arrived in heaven. It was certainly more expensive but worth every penny.

<Content>Great Hotel- Great Service- Very Friendly and Accommodating Staff The experience from booking, to check-in to check-out was wonderful. Tulinh Luciano-DeSmith- sales director- gave me tons of information about the Aqua hotels to choose from and recommended the Wave after I provided my preferences over the phone. She was right on target with her recommendation. The room was spacious, beds were so comfortable with soft sheets! The views on both balconies were relaxing and you could see the ocean and the mountains in plain view. Precilla and George at the front desk were very helpful and friendly and my check-in was effortless and fast. As a frequent business traveler, I would place this hotel at the top of my list for value and quality. Great room, friendly service, and a perfect location!

<Content>Great Staff! From the moment we got to the Waikiki Wave we had a great experience. We arrived early off of a cruise and the bellman took our bags and assured us as soon as the room was ready he would bring them up for us! They upgraded our room because at the time they had the extra room and we had reserved 2 beds for the 3 adult ladies in our family. The best thing about the hotel was the the entire staff from the person who booked our excursions, the bellmen who helped us with our luggage and the memorable and fun front staff George and Kalei. My mother lost a screw in her glasses, I asked if the maintence man had a screw driver so that I could try fixing them, he came up, made a make shift piece for the glasses and took the time to fix them!!! What great service!

<Content>Thumbs up! We are a family with three young children under the age of six. Our experience at the Waikiki Wave was positive right from the start. When we placed a phone call from Minneapolis airport, indicating that our flight had been delayed we were immediately assured that we would not be charged for the night (we were supposed to arrive). The hotel staff was full of smiles, friendly and very helpful. The cleaning staff was more than accomodating, ensuring that our room was clean before our baby napped in the afternoon. We were concerned by the reviews indicating that the noise was a deterrent. Again, the staff placed us in a room on the 14th floor, away from the street, proactively placing us in a spot that was most conducive for quiet in the night, for our children. Yes, there was some noise, but one has to remember that the hotel is located in a desirable, heart of Waikiki area, so we knew this when booking the hotel. Downtown Chicago or any other big city would have citynoise also. Our children (6,4 and 1) had no difficulty sleeping (other than jet lag!) and neither did we. We'd recommend this hotel to others definitely, but for ourselves, may choose a hotel more off the beaten track, simply because we know we can walk to desirable areas within blocks. It was a wonderful location, however. Any drawbacks? Perhaps the stairs leading to the hotel lobby were a bit challenging, with a double stroller, but we managed. We booked a suite, which was great - due to the layout of the rooms, it was a little odd, in that, there were 2 queen beds in the living room. I know that they can't help this, but it would have been great to have two beds in the screened off portion and a couch/bed in the living room portion... a very minor detail. When we were leaving, thanks to Rachel, we were allowed to extend our room for 2 hours, to allow our babe to have a nap before leaving on an 8 hour plane ride. We SO appreciated her consideration!!! Overall, mahalo Waikiki Wave!

<Content>Great Value My wife, grown son and I stayed at the Wave for 9 nights in January and just really enjoyed our stay. The hotels proximity to the beach, shopping, and restaurants made for a great holiday.  While there was some noise at night, it did not prevent us from sleeping after long days of sightseeing. My wife is a light sleeper and still slept well in the comfortable beds even though we were only on the 6th floor. The staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to greet us from the front door to front desk to the chambermaids in the hallways. My family will definitely stay here again in the future when we are able to return to your beautiful island.  Mahalo!

The hotel is right in the heart of Waikiki so everything is close by. We had a room on the 12th floor which was fresh and clean, and the microwave and fridge were well used during our 2 week stay. The bakery is right next door if you fancy a fresh danish for breakfast and you can get everything else that you need in the ABC store. The area is safe and you are well looked after. Well done Aqua!

<Content>Great place to stay we stayed two nights before we rented a condo on the north shore and then one night before flying home. The staff were great. Very friendly and helpful. Super bell hop and George at the front desk were tops. We were travelling with another couple so we stayed in a mini-suite which was great for what we needed. There are 3 queen size beds. Two beds in a big room and one bed in a bedroom which has sliding doors to close of this room for privacy. Two balconies, two LCD TV's, fridge and everything you would want. Our one balcony faced the ocean and you could look right down on the International market. The hotel and room were clean and we had no problems. We would stay there again. They also had free wireless internet that worked. We booked to first two nights through a website and payed a lot more than when we walked in off the street and booked the room the last night before leaving.

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed for 10 nights , returning home on the 6th of Feb.My first comment would be that all staff at this hotel was extremely friendly and we were greeted everywhere we went. My husband is an owner/GM of a Comfort Suites and makes it a point to speak to as many people as he can.Our room was 1516, top floor, and it was of good size and was clean. We have stayed at O'Hana resorts, as well as the Hilton Hawaiian, and I must say that this hotel room was better than I expected. We talked to several other guests and never heard one negative comment , everyone enjoyed the hotel and was having a great time.Great beds, linen was very nice-sheets were changed often. All housekeeping staff were friendly and more than willing to go out of their way take care of any of our needs. No-charge for coffee(every place else I have stayed charged) Breakfast was very nice, fresh fruit and pastries, juice, coffee and hot cereal. Thats the way it should be, quick and easy to get you on your way, everyone out their knows how expensive food is in Hawaii, and its fortunate that Aqua offers this to its guest. I thought the workout room was great, and the hotel itself was kept quite clean. When the hotel found out it was our 4th anniversary, a bottle of champagne and chocolates were brought to our room.That my friends is customer service. We were married at the Hilton (paid dearly)and didnt so much as receive one thing from management. I guess what I liked the least about the hotel would be what others find is their best feature, location. I much prefer a quiet area to be around and this place is definitely in the middle of the action. (We knew that before booking) We left a couple of days before the ProBowl and it was getting quite loud and lively on Kuhio, we must say that we only heard noise on Sat. night and it was only for a minute or two. Parking at the hotel is difficult, we arrived after 11pm and no luck, we parked next door at this garage for $10 a day.Good dealThank You for the Aloha spirit

<Content>Great Value, Great Location, and great people My wife and I stayed at this hotel before and after a 7 day NCL cruise. We had several guests that would be joining us since we were getting married. With over 20 people staying at various hotels, and most staying here we learned a lot. First off we loved the hotel, and the location. My parents stayed beach side and paid 3x what we did. We are both in our late 20's and really didnt spend much time in the hotel besides sleeping so we were very happy about the hotel we had picked and saved a lot of money on. Our other guests never complained about there stay and there ages ranged from 30-70.Location was only a 5 min walk to the beach....amazing!!The only issue we found during our 5nights we stayed was a bit of a noise issue. This was not as evident upon our return after the cruise in which we stayed on floor 14.So if your looking for a great hotel with great location and would rather spend your money on food or surfer gear...this is the place.

<Content>Enjoyable experience at the wave. My wife and I stayed at the wave from January 20-28. The check in was quick and painless. The check in staff was very warm and friendly, actually all of the staff was very accommodating during our stay. We checked into our second floor room with the wonderful view of the mechanized parking garage(lol). The room was very clean and spacious, you could tell the Aqua company had done some room remodeling since taking over but there is still a little room for improvement. The beds are comfy and nothing beats the cool Hawaiian breeze coming in through your sliding glass door. The hotel is a quick walk to the beach and to many hot spots and eateries. I recommend the St. Germain bakery next to the hotel for breakfast, they have a wonderful assortment of freshly made pastries. My only real gripe is the parking or lack there of, if you are out past seven PM you are probably out of luck in the underground garage. The good news is that you can park at a hotel down the street and they will reimburse you. Yes, I am nitpicking but it is still annoying, Overall I had a great time at the Wave and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Just what we expected!!! (Sydney Visitors) This was mine and my boyfriend's 1st visit to hawaii and we had chosen this hotel from all previous reviews and thought this sounded great. All I can say is overall it was exactly what we expected, the hotel staff were friendly and the location of the hotel was close to everything, beach, shops, restaurants etc. We stayed 15 nights at this hotel and would stay at the Aqua again. The only down fall was about the noise outside and the doors not being so much sound proof, you can hear doors slamming and people talking in the corridors. We could sleep through it at nite but it was the morning noise that always woke us up. Didn't bother as much and the longer we stayed we got use to the noise and had the best sleep.I would highly recommend asking for a floor 9 and above, we were on the 4th floor and had a view of the parking lot which contributed to the noise. But when we do stay here again would def want a better view.But other than that this hotel is great for anyone looking for good location and are looking for a hotel which isnt to expensive. Rooms were very spacious and had been refurbished. Was really happy with the way it looked.

<Content>not very impressed Our family of 4 had just returned from Hawaii. We stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave, and contrary to many other reviews, we found this property not to our satisfaction. We were situated on the 15th floor, room 1515 to be exact. It has 3 queen sized beds, one of them situated in a room divided by a sliding, thin chinese style screen door. One of the first thing that we noticed was the flourescent lighting everywhere. Especially in the bathroom, this lighting was not sufficient, and had to have some bulbs changed twice during our stay. Also, the televisions had lines running up the screen, and after several attempts to repair it, ended up that nothing would work. It seems to me, that the wiring in this old building for the cable tv needed to be upgraded. The staff gave us an option to move down 1 floor to a room that didn't have a television problem, but we did not feel like packing everything up half way through our 2 week stay to move down a floor to get better tv reception, and chose to accept the tv for the way it was. (Having 2 of our 4 person family not be able to be in the sun very much, the tv came in handy.) Th e main issue I would have to mention would be the noise at night, especially the garbage trucks emptying the bins. Incredibly loud! And the music blaring late into the night from the marketplace. The staff supplied earplugs, but I woud sooner have a quiet neighbourhood instead of earplugs! Also, make sure not to keep the children out too late, because when we came back to the lobby around 10pm, there were working girls right outside the main entrance, offering their services! Overall...not impressed. Definately would not stay at this location again.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed here for 5 days in Jan 08. The hotel and rooms were clean, bright and attractrive. The beds were really comfortable and having wireless internet allowed us to stay in touch with family members. Staff were friendly and helpful. Close to beach ( a few minutes walk) and lots of the other attractions of Waikiki. The only problem we had was the entrance to the hotel was not very accessible for people with physical handicaps. My husband has mobility problems and the front entrance steps were a challenge for him, especially if we had been walking for a bit. It could pose a problem for some people. We had read about noise problems but we did not experience these during our stay, perhaps because we were on the 12th floor. Generally I am a light sleeper and this was not a problem for me. We would have loved to stay longer but our cruise ship was leaving. We would definetly stay there again if we were to return to Honolulu. Great bakery next door and good restaurant for breakfast a couple od doors past the bakery. ( can't remember the name). Overall this was an excellent experience for us.

<Content>Nice hotel You can spend weeks on the Internet looking at hotel reviews in Honolulu... there are 100's of hotels and reviews are subjective anyway. We've been in 100's of hotels in dozens of countries over the last 30 years and sometimes it astounds me what people's expectations are and what they complain about. So...if you are looking for a decent hotel at a reasonable price (around $150/day), stop wasting time...just choose the Aqua Waikiki Wave. The location is excellent, the staff are helpful and friendly and it's clean and has nice rooms. Plus it has a pretty decent free breakfast.We stayed there twice enroute and returning from Fiji for a total of 6 nights. Yes, there is some noise on Friday nights from the night club nearby but it's not that bad. Other nights were perfectly peaceful. There is Net access downstairs for as little as $1 for 6 minutes. Each room has a balcony. We were on the 12th and 14th floors with a pretty decent view of Diamond Head, the sea and the surrounding city. It's only a few blocks from the beach. If staying on the beach is your priority then expect to pay 3 times as much as the prices at the Wave.Overall, we had no problems and would definitely stay there again. It's a nice little hotel. And at the price, it's hard to beat.

<Content>Loved the Wave We booked our hotel thru a site called Great Hawaii Vacations, and we were really pleased with our choice. The hotel has been recently renovated, and is considered a boutique hotel. The location is wonderful - about 1 block from the International Marketplace and right next to Duke's Lane. We were upgraded to a junior suite, which was a corner room with 2 big beds, 2 lanais, a coffeemaker, fridge and microwave. All of the staff were courteous and well informed. The housekeepers did an excellent job, and the front desk staff were exceptionally pleasant. We will definitely consider staying there again when we return to Waikiki.

<Content>Great hotel for the cost; skip breakfast This hotel was a good bargain. The location is excellent, it has easy parking and there is a little bit of noise as mentioned in previous reviews.My brother was there also and he was on the other side of the hotel (the left side if you are looking at the hotel from the outside) and I think it was quieter than our side. We were on the right side and the garbage truck comes by around 6am daily. They do provide ear plugs (which we didn't use) if it would really get to you.The hotel is clean (a must for me!) and the location is great. You walk through the international marketplace across the main street and you can be sitting in front of the Royal Hawaiian.Our package included their $5 breakfast. It was not very good though. They provide only carbs, fruit and juice. No milk or protein. I had to bring my own milk. If it is in included, it's okay for a few days...but don't buy it as an extra. You can go get a $2.99 special down the street that is really good :-)The breakfast room is also very crowded; they could use a few more tables.Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I will investigate it on our return trip to Oahu (which I hope is next year!).

<Content>Trip #3 is a charm! Yes, it is trip #3 for us at Aqua Waikiki Wave. We've been there in Jan. 2007, April 2007, and Jan. 2008. Why? We feel like it's our second home and hope to return again soon!There have been a few changes since we stayed last but comfort and service have not changed! To help combat the noise of a big city nightlife, there were ear plugs provided. One night I tried them just to see. They do help even though this was the quietest stay out of the three. The beds are still AWESOME! We keep returning because:- convenience to a variety of places to eat, shopping, etc.- 5 minute walk to the beach without paying the extra $$ for ocean front room- clean rooms with very comfortable beds, mini fridge, and microwave- very friendly and helpful staffThank you again, Aqua Waikiki Wave, for another wonderful stay! We look forward to coming back.

<Content>fantastic value Upgraded to junior suite and still cheaper for 2 nights, than one in the beach front hotelsRoom was huge, very clean very comfortable, staff very friendly and courteous, also very helpful. Had 2 balconies both which caught sun during the day.10 minute walk to Waikiki beach.View a bit grim during the day,but at night with the lights the international market was lovely.The only fault with this hotel is the small out of the way pool, via the garage,which is noisy and smells of food from the market,However, if you are looking for comfort, hospitality, and good service, stay here, you can always go to the beach, or the other hotel pools, although having done this, they were imperwsonal.Restaurant on site (didn't try) but lots of others around as well.Excellent value.

<Content>Wonderful Boutique Hotel with excellent location! I am a travel agent so always check out hotels that interest me while I am out and about on my travels. I had heard several good comments about the Aqua Wave so wanted to check it out for myself.I was pleasantly suprised with the Aqua Wave. This hotel is an excellent value for its location. All rooms have been renovated and are spanking fresh. The standard room is quite large and has two plush queen size beds. This is a larger room than most in Waikiki and you definitely will not feel cramped. There is plenty of room for a roll away or crib and each room has a decent sized mini fridge, coffee maker  microwave. This is awesome for leftovers..it seems Waikiki restaraunts have huge portions. The bathroom is clean and has a full size tub/shower. Many Waikiki areas are shower only. If you have a large family this hotel is excellent and has one bedroom suites. This room is huge and set up quite nicely. There is one bedroom with a Queen size bed then the outer room has Two Queen beds.. set up in a manner that still give a good measure of privacy. This room is great if you have a family and grandparents are with-- or if you just have a group of six. All rooms also have at least one........larger rooms 2 flat screen televisions and every floor has its own wi fii for good FREE internet connection. Bring your laptop!The lobby has fresh coffee and fruit daily and if you buy your package through a whole sale company (aka Pleasant Vacations or something similar) it includes free continental bkfst daily.Ok so this review is getting a bit long ... I will wrap it up with two other comments...LOCATION LOCATION! This is a great location a five min walk to the beach. This is the nice area of beach... not the rocky side. It is surrounded by places to shop and dine and very close to the international market place. I would not hesitate to try the Aqua Wave. It's fresh modern decor makes it a pleasant surrounding to stay in while the pleasant and friendly staff still give that good old fashioned personalized service you like with smaller hotels. They will bend over backwards to please you here. I look forward to my next trip to Waikiki-- where I plan to stay at the Aqua Waikiki Wave.

<Content>good location Stayed for two nights on the fourth floor room large and clean fridge and tv and coffee maker, bathroom a bit tight but ok two things against, noise from the street but they do give you earplugs(only one set) and smell from extractors of the food court make the balcony unuseable. our second stay was at the end of our holiday for two nights we were upgraded to higher floor and bigger room (no charge) which had a better view which allowed us to see sunset while having a drink. noise much less of a problem on higher floors but still the smell of the food court when the balcony door was open but hey keep it closed not a problem. really close to the action of the Marketplace and food court. go for the upgrade its worth it.Ian  Debbie

<Content>Suprise ! Suprise ! We are pleasantly suprise about this hotel, the rooms are clean and centrally located. We were given the 8th floor so the noise is not a factor. You can walk to shops,close to the beach and eating places. The staff are cordial and polite .They served continental breakfast . We do not like to pay for the parking but considering how crowded it is .. we understand. If you are staying at this hotel you do not need a rent a car( save yourself in paying for parking space) As long as your room are in the upper floors,you will be just fine . We might consider staying here again in our future visit to Waikiki

<Content>Just what we were looking for My finance and I LOVED this hotel... The staff was very nice and accommodating with any needs we had. The rooms were very clean and modern. We also got a coupon book upon check-in that had some great 2 for 1 dinner deals! The location was perfect, a few blocks from Waikiki Beach and right on the bus line on Kuhio. The only downfall I would have to say is the pool... it's very small and located behind the parking garage. At night Kuhio ave could get quite busy and loud... but the hotel provides ear-plugs to help with that! We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonable, convenient hotel in Waikiki!

<Content>Nice Hotel My husband and I traveled to Hawaii for the first time and picked Aqua Waikikii Wave for a place to rest after a long flight from the east coast. Check in was a breeze and the staff very eager to help us. We found ample parking when we arrived. We quickly found our rooms and were thrilled to see they were exactly as advertised and we really enjoyed the patio where you could watch the city going by (we could also see the famous Waikikii Beach a very short walk away!) Dining and shopping are plentiful in the area. I do think we were lucky to find this place thanks to Trip Advisor and it's traveling community.-------

<Content>OK for the price The positives: Good value - for $145 a night, it's not a bad place at all. Friendly staff - everyone was courteous and helpful. Decent-sized room, with a comfortable bed, smallish flat-screen TV, fridge, coffee maker, and good water pressure in the shower. A block and a bit from the beach. Close to cheap breakfast joints, Starbucks, etc.BUT.The parking garage is a joke. Small, with extremely tight spaces, and no self-serve elevator to the lobby. If you have a lot of stuff to transport (we were there for work and had equipment to bring up to one of our rooms every night), you have to call a bellman to come down and fetch you in the service elevator, which apparently is also used to transport garbage, or at least smells like it. Sorry guys, but this kind of garage just isn't worth $18, given that in other cities that kind of money gets you valet service and secure parking. Plus, if the garage is full (and it often is), you're out of luck -- have to park in one of the neighbouring garages for $25 a night.The bathroom lights were weirdly dim... and actually took a couple of minutes to warm up to something resembling full strength.There was a comfortable queen-size bed, but no night tables. One side had a small desk next to the bed, the other had nothing.Overall, the Aqua Hotels website presents the Wave as a funky, modern boutique hotel. In fact, it's nothing of the sort. It's a cheaply renovated tourist hotel that's OK for the price, but that's about it.TIPS:The Galaxy Steak House a few doors away is friendly and has a decent $3 breakfast, but it's dingy and dark. For a couple of bucks more, Keoni, a bit further down the road, has outdoor seating, table cloths, and great fresh fruit. It's also serves very good Thai food at night.Don't spend any more time at the Wave than you have to. Walk down to the beachfront Moana Surfrider -- the spectacular 100-year-old hotel on Kalakaua -- and hang out in one of the rocking chairs on the street side or deck chairs on the beach side. No one will bother you. Or go a bit further down to the Beach Bar and order an umbrella drink.

<Content>Great hotel! My 22 year old daughter and I stayed at the Waikiki Wave for 4 nights from Jan. 10 - 14, 2008. The hotel is located about two blocks from Waikiki Beach and also near a Starbucks, Jack in the Box, a bakery, a couple of ABC stores, the International Marketplace and a really good Vietnamese restaurant. The bus stop is close by as well. Our room was on the 10th floor with two very comfortable queen sized beds, a microwave, small refrigerator, flat screen tv, dvd player, and a lanai with a partial view of the ocean and Diamondhead. The hotel staff (especially George at the front desk) was very accomodating and friendly. The hotel is also less than a block away from a Thrifty car rental location. We rented a car just for 24 hours and had no problems with the parking garage. Another plus is the fact that the hotel is entirely non-smoking. Also, the shower had really good water pressure. The only downside would be the noise at night but with ear plugs it really isn't a problem. We will recommend the Waikiki Wave to our friends and hopefully can come back ourselves soon.

<Content>Excellent Customer Service We booked our hotel with Bookit.com. The online service was excellent. They even mailed maps to our house prior to the trip. Once at the hotel the staff checking us in were very attentive and customer service oriented. The housekeeping department were great. The hotel was clean and above average for the price.The only draw back to this hotel was that the pool is very small and it is loud due to being next to the open air market. The hotel does provide ear plugs :) I highly recommend this hotel and the staff definitely made our stay a great experience! Thanks!

<Content>Loved this hotel, great location and awesome value Well what can i write here that has not already been said.Positives: *Close to everything, one block to beach, restaurants all around*Clean rooms and housekeeping was attentive to our needs*Friendly staff, they treated us like family for our one week stay*Rooms were a good size*beach towels you can check out for your stayNegatives:*street noise can be much if a light sleeper. worse on weekends*parking is one level and some stalls are cramp. first come first serve, although in one week stay we never had to park elsewhere I would definitely recommend this hotel for value based hotel shoppers. are there better hotels out there? maybe, but i think you will definitely pay more for them and i would not be surprised to see the Wave raise their rates in the future to match the others in the area. Take advantage of these rates while you can. they are not done improving the facilities, when we were there they had just started a breakfast buffet for five bux per person. In closing i would like to extend our deepest thanks to the staff and management of the Wave for making our stay an enjoyable and memorable one.

<Content>Ride The Wave!! I stayed at the wave with my husband and 16 yr. old daughter from Dec.22-Dec.30 2007. Before going to Hawaii I read ALOT of the reviews for this hotel. I was a little concerned about some of the negative reviews, but decided to book this hotel anyway. Boy, am I glad I did! FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE!! All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed in room 1405. Great corner room. We had two lanais, both had beautiflul views. King and queen size bed and lots of space in the room to move. Fridge and microwave was great to have. You can check out decent beach towels for free at the front desk, how convenient! Everything you need is within walking distance. But it is very easy to take the bus, only $2, for more shopping, sight seeing, etc. we did not rent a car, so we did not deal with parking. Would recommend renting a car for one day if going to North Shore. We took the bus and seen lots of little places we would have liked to stop at had we had a car. We were there when they opened the new continental breakfast on the 1st floor. Nice variety of choices, much better than when it was next door. The fitness room was opened and also very nice area with good eqiupment to use. They even have a scale, if you dare to step on it!! I used the computer room near the lobby to check return flight home. Nice to have available for only small fee. I think this hotel is very cute, comfortable, nicely updated, has great rates, super location, and the staff does a very good job at making your stay with them enjoyable. I had the chance to speak with Lynette, hotel manager and Pam, director of engineering. Really nice women, I enjoyed my little chit chats with them both. They take pride in their jobs and really care about the hotel guests. I would absolutely stay at this hotel again!!

<Content>you will love it ! After reading many reviews on TripAdvisor, my friend and I decided to book the Aqua Waikiki Wave for our trip in early December. We arrived early (a few hours before check in), but were lucky enough to be able to check in straight away which was great as we wanted to freshen up. When we first stepped into our room (level 10) we were surprised to see that the room was actually much better than what was given credit for on TripAdvisor. The room is spacious and very clean !! Oh and how can I forget to mention the beds !! The beds were soo comfortable my friend and I almost missed out shuttle bus to the airport !! Not that we would've minded .. but I'm sure our bosses wouldn't have been too impressed hehehOur stay at the Wave was great ! My friend and I really enjoyed our stay and we would definitely stay there again if we go back. I have to say that the staff were fantastic ! Super friendly, especially the two at the concierge desk - Malia and Dorian =) If you're unsure of what tours to do or you just want some advice from the locals, ask for either of them !! Dorian was dealing with us during our stay but Malia is cool too !

<Content>It hit the spot! We stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave for 3 nights in December 2007, and had a good experience overall. We were on the 9th floor and had 2 double-beds in our room. The beds were comfortable, and the room was clean and had many amenities. The staff at the reception desk was friendly and helpful, as was the concierge staff (who helped us to rent a car for 1 day so we could explore the island of Oahu). The only drawback to this hotel is, yes, it is noisy (other reviews attest to this). I'm a fairly heavy sleeper and had a hard time due to the noise on my 1st night there. The level of street noise at this hotel's location is above average; I've stayed at hotels in midtown Manhattan that were quieter (the hotel does provide earplugs to help remedy this problem). There is an alley with small shopping vendors right next to the hotel (on the west side of the building, I think) where people pass through all day and night; a lot of noise comes from this area, even though the vendors close down at night. If you can deal with the noise, the Aqua Waikiki Wave is a great place to stay. It's clean, comfortable, and the location is perfect for exploring Waikiki and Honolulu.

<Content>Full Value  We were a family of 11 and searched internet for options. Aqua Wave offered the best deal on paper and delivererd in person. We took all previous visitors comments into account and found the property delivered even more than we expected. Rooms were always kept, staff was always friendly and helpful, and yes as always, location, location, location. Close to beach, restaurants, night life, shopping and transportation island wide.Internet was a little hit and miss, but could always find signal in lobby area on wireless. After all it was Christmas so hickups happen but were minimal in this case.As others have indicated, don't plan on parking in limited space and stay on upper floors. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>Dubious Experience I stayed at this hotel the last week in November for five nights. Check-in and front desk staff were fine. I liked the easy booking through their website. As promised I had a room on a higher floor with a partial ocean view and received the CAA discount. Rooms have been rennovated for a boutique look. Linen on beds looked very clean and I liked the fact that they used sheeting over the duvet instead of a duvet cover that never gets cleaned. Bathroom don't really match the rennovation of the rooms and look somewhat dated but are adequate. Carpeting in hallways looked quite dirty and not updated - could use some carpet shampooing. As I checked in by myself and had lots of towels I asked the maid to not clean my room for first couple days. On the third day I asked her to clean and left her a tip in advance. When I returned to room that afternoon I noted something had been moved in one of the drawers and my suitcase which I had locked was unlocked and the lock was sitting on the floor beside my suitcase which i would never do. I had left the key in a small purse in one of the drawers. There was nothing of value in my drawers or my suitcase - these items were in the safe provided in the room - but to prevent or deter anyone from snooping through my things - I had just put a bunch of items in the suiticase. Nothing was taken but this was a bit disconcerting. As bellman and maids both have access to the rooms I did not want to accuse my maid of going through my things but it was odd it was coincidental with the one day I allowed the maid to clean my room. I asked the maid to not clean my room for the next couple of days after that as one person does not make much of a mess and there wre lots of towels. Another odd thing happened on the day I checked out. I stored my bags for the day as my plane did not leave until almost midnight. I returned to pickup up my bags and had some time to kill so started shuffling a few things around in my bags. I found a slit in the side compartment of my carry-on so you could reach into the main part of the bag which was locked. This was not a new bag but I did not notice when I packed for this trip or during my trip in Waikiki that there was a slit at the bottom of the outside compartment.. As I had bagged the wet items in the carry-on in a plastic bag - you could'nt really take anything out of the bag through the slit in the side compartment. I found this experience really kind of dubious. I have stayed at hotels in Canada, U.S., Mexico, and Europe and never had a problem with staff tampering or touching my belongings. If I return to Waikiki I would stay at another hotel and I would not recommend this hotel to my friends or family. The hotel sent me an automated email after my trip and I emailed back my comments and never got a reply from anyone. Vancouver, Canada.

<Content>Great hotel at reasonable rate We stayed here for two nights on a first visit to Hawaii before boarding a cruise ship and highly recommend it. There are three essentials I look for in a hotel room: cleanliness, a comfortable bed, and quiet. Based on other reviews, I was a little concerned about how quiet the place would be, so I paid extra for a room on the 10th floor which was well worth the extra money. We had a small balcony with a partial-ocean view and were high enough above the street that noise was not a problem. Cleanliness and housekeeping were outstanding, and the bed and linen were as good as what's found in a Westin or Mariott. The staff was exceedingly helpful and more than willing to spend as much time as necessary to answer all our questions. Parking was expensive at the lot next door where they put your car on an elevator and move it to a stall on on of the upper floors (what happens when the elevator breaks down?) and we never did figure out who got to park in the basement lot of the hotel itself, but you really don't need a car at this central location.

<Content>Decent place for a decent price We stayed at the hotel for one night before our cruise. We were a little worried driving up to it. There is a lot of construction going on and we thought it might not be the safest place. Our fears were unfounded. The room was nice--2 queen beds, decent sized bath and quite clean. It was not the newest, not on the beach, but close to restaurants and shopping. The staff was outstanding and helpful. They answered every stupid tourist question I had and did so with a smile. They stored our luggage while we went to Pearl Harbor for the day and took care of getting us a cab to the cruise ship. The continental breakfast was only donuts, coffee, and juice in the adjoining restaurant. If you prefer, they will take $3 off of your breakfast bill instead.Would I stay there again? I would say Maybe. I'm not a big fan of Honolulu, but if I were there, it's as good as anywhere for the price.

The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful, the maid service was outstanding and the concierge was without the doubt the best I have ever worked with.Our room was clean and spacious with 3 large beds. (We had 2 adults and 3 kids). The flat screen TV sets with DVD are a bonus, even though we did not watch much TV. We tried the Chinese restaurant in the lobby and the food and service were very good. It was so busy the first night that we cound not even get a table, so reservations are suggested.I will stay here again, and recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>Very good experience for us, though houskeeping could be improved. First, I should say I don't have a lot of experience with fine hotels; I've stayed at much lower-priced motels/hotels in the past.On arrival, we were greeted by Josh, who was so friendly and helpful that I felt immediately comfortable. Most of the other staff were also friendly, although Josh was outstanding.Our room was clean and spacious, with 3 queen beds in two rooms (for 3 people). The shower had lots of pressure (which was not adjustable), was clean, and high enough to be comfortable for me. However, there was no exhaust fans (or windows), and the lights were the compact fluorescent type that were dim when first turned on. They seemed to get brighter after several minutes, or maybe my eyes just adjusted. The water from the tub would not turn off completely, but didn't really bother me.The beds were comfortable. The window near our bed would not close all the way, so it was a little noisy, but the noise went away before we actually went to sleep, so it was OK. I didn't report this.The day we checked out, our plane wasn't leaving until 11:00 PM, and they allowed us to store our suitcases, loaned beach towels to us in the afternoon, and allowed us to use a room to shower later, all for no charge. That really made our last day much, much better. The beach towels were always available each day, and they didn't seem to make a big deal about checking to make sure we didn't lose any.They have free in-room Wi-Fi, free telephone calls, a microwave and small fridge in the room. I have no idea about things like the pool - who wants to use a pool when you're a block from the beach?Housekeeping was a little variable. The first morning, I used the packet of regular coffee, and left the packet of decaf. That night, there were two packets of decaf, and no regular. We left a note, and it was fine after that.They only left 3 bath towels each day, which was adequate, but sometimes it's nice to have extra. There were a few hand towels and wash cloths, though. And a bathmat.It's also very close to a couple of food courts and shopping areas, so everything is convenient.

<Content>Convenient, Good Value, Inadequate Housekeeping  I stayed at the Waikiki Wave for a week in early December with two friends.The hotel is a very good choice for decent accommodations close to thebeach and near lots of restaurants. The lobby could use a little updating to make the first impression more welcoming instead of a sea of hard beige surfaces with neon from the hotel signs and the Chinese restaurant in the lobby.The room was very spacious. We booked a Junior Suite Superior Wave, and each had our own queen bed, one of which was in a small bedroom separated from the main room by a sliding door. Aside from the beds, there was a shortage of actual chairs to sit on, except for two hard-backed chairs and the patio furniture. We all agreed that the beds were too soft.There were two small terraces, one facing towards the beach, which provided a view of other hotels, including the picturesque Royal Hawaiian and a tiny sliver of water. The other faced the parking garage of the neighboring office building and overlooked the market stalls lining Dukes Alley. Each had two white plastic lawn chairs.The bathroom really needed some work. It was impossible to get a hot shower and there was mildew in the shower enclosure. Also, the completely interior bathroom was dimly lit by compact fluorescents. This, according to one of my companions, made it really difficult to apply makeup.The housekeeping was really bad. I used one of the coffee mugs for orange juice and found it placed back by the coffee maker unwashed. Over the course of the week I tried various things that might get it changed - finally leaving it half-full of water worked! Most days, the beds weren't even properly re-made - the cover was simply pulled up and smoothed. Housekeeping also tended to ignore the do not disturbsign and knocked early in the day (before 9:30). On our last day, the housekeeper came barging in, claiming that she thought we had already checked out. (The door was unlatched because one of us went out for coffee.) Over the course of the week, we had to call the front desk for vital paper goods, as they had not been restocked. And finally, on the last day we discovered that our room door had been painted, as had all of the doors on our floor. Thankfully we were leaving as one of my friends is sensitive to paint fumes.The hotel pool was seriously disappointing. It's basically there so they can claim they have one. It's behind the hotel, accessible from an exterior stairway that you can reach only by waking through the underground garage and an alley and then climbing a flight of stairs up to the pool deck. It's surrounded by tall buildings and the back of the food court of the International Market, which gives off the aroma of fried foods. There's no way to actually use this pool and enjoy it or to sunbathe.Given that the hotel is a reasonable value, my friends and I rolled with the punches and enjoyed our trip. Even with the shortcomings I pointed out above, the combination of location and value would make me consider staying there again.

<Content>Incredible Value  I think virtually every review so far has mentioned the amazing value of the Aqua Waikiki Wave. The rooms are clean, comfortable and the hotel is central being just one block up from Kalakaua Avenue - everything is within a short walk.Being on a busy street and next to an alley shopping market, one can expect quite a bit of noise until about 11 PM.LCD TV, DVD player and mini-fridge - all great bonuses in the room.The room's weak point is definitely it's bathroom: it's ancient and falling apart (besides a new towel rack, it's clear the bathroom is from the 80s). What makes this strange is the fact that the rest of the room is actually quite contemporary. This all said, the aging bathroom is clean.It's not a five, but I highly recommend the Waikiki Wave.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel! We couldn't have asked for a better hotel/staff!! They were very prompt and courteous every time we asked questions or had a need. The room was very spacious and clean; our view was to-die-for, the staff printed directions for us(ie, didn't just say go that way) and gave us great tips about using the free shopping shuttles. We had a problem with a TV and they traded out with another one within 10 minutes. They were absolutely on top of everything and were so nice. The hotel is so convenient to restaurants and the beach - couldn't beat this one if you wanted to!! We hope to return someday and will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Facilities, Top Notch Service I am a big time Aqua lover. As a regular traveler through Honolulu, I have stayed at many of the Waikiki properties. Aqua's hotels consistently impress me with their focus on impeccable service and cleanliness. We recently held our annual meeting in Honolulu and chose the Aqua Waikiki Wave as the site. The rooms were spectacularly clean, large and updated. The meeting space was exactly what we wanted. The service at the hotel is second-to-none. I would highly recommend the property. Kudos to Evelyn and Tulihn for making our stay a memorable one!

<Content>Aqua Waikiki Wave - Good Location, Great Value My wife, teenage son and I visit Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii each year during Thanksgiving week. Over the course of the past seven years, we have stayed at three (3) different Waikiki hotels. Overall, we found the Aqua Waikiki Wave to be the nicest property, with the best all-around location and the best value for our lodging dollar.The staff is pleasant and courteous. The rooms are clean, spacious and well-kept. Amenities are adequate if not outstanding.I would heartily recommend the Aqua Waikiki Wave to any budget-conscious traveler.

<Content>nice hotel but extremely noisy This is an attractive hotel in a very convenient location in Waikiki- walking distance to all the main attractions and restaurants. The busy location does lend itself to a noisy stay- partly compounded by the fact that the patio doors are not double-insulated glass. Ear plugs are provided to guests, and necessary for a good night's sleep.The staff was very efficient and accomodating. The room was spacious, clean, attractive and had nice ammenties including a coffee maker, fridge, wireless internet, balcony and high quality shampoo and other bath products.

<Content>Great little hotel! This hotel is in a superb location in Waikiki--2 blocks to the beach and very close to all of the restaurants/shopping. We had a jr. deluxe corner suite --HUGE room with 2 very comfy queen beds and 2 walls were all windows, each with its own patio. Small tv, spotty reception but had DVD player. Good micro  roomy fridge. Tasty coffee. Small bathroom, but lots of towels and fantastic water pressure! Free wireless internet--sometimes a little slow. Up on the 11th floor, we didn't hear much street noise, except on the night of the UH vs. UW football game. No room service or high-end soaps or robes, but we didn't care--we didn't spend a lot of time in our room. What we saved in hundreds of dollars by staying at this hotel instead of the spendy beachfront properties (some of which didn't look any better than where we stayed), we applied towards really fun activities. Very friendly  helpful staff, especially the people at the activities desk. The only negatives I noted was that the housekeeping was a bit forgetful at replacing supplies, but anything we wanted was immediately sent up. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to avoid over-inflated prices but wants safe, above-average comfort  great location for much less (I normally stay at 4 or 5 star hotels whenever I travel but I'm always on the lookout for good value). We had our 9 yr. old son with us and he loved it. Great hotel for families, singles, couples, elderly  business travelers.

<Content>Five Stars for the Aqua Waikiki Wave My family and I stayed at the Wave for a Ladies Night Out vacation. We absolutely loved the Waikiki Wave. The rooms were incredible! Everything looked brand new and the room was so large. We even had two balconies. The staff was wonderful. There were so many friendly faces working hard to ensure that we had the best time possible. If you asked for anything extra, within seconds a staff member was at your door with your requested item. When we go back to Hawaii, we will stay at the Waikiki wave!

<Content>Good Location, LESS than Average Room... Good location, centrally located, close to shopping, food, and beaches. Staff at hotel were very friendly and accomodating. Good room rates for Waikiki....BUT with that being said, hotel falls under the term Boutique and that has alot to be desired. Now we have stayed in Boutiques from New York to CA to Salt Lake City and so forth. The rooms and the hotel itself are a little dated. Bathrooms need renovation, we had leaky shower faucet and very low water pressure. Bathroom ceiling very low and had cheesy thin shower curtain. The kind that is transparent and you see at Holiday Inn or something. Flat screen LCD panel was old and volume jumped from High to Low at different times while watching T.V Not that it mattered because we were only there to shower and sleep. Outside and surrounding area of hotel has LOTS and LOTS of noise. The room supplies you with ONE set of ear plugs with a warning about the noise level due to Waikiki Atmospphere I had no probelm sleeping but there was plenty of action going on from 11pm till 5:30am EVERY night. But I realized where we were so I didn't mind. But if you are a light sleeper, beware. Keep in mind we were on the 11th floor and we could hear everything going on in the surrounding hotels and street. Overall we didn't expect much and the room served its purpose. Clean, comfortable beds and water to wash up and shower. The two things I liked most were the mini fridge and microwave. Came in handy. As for everything else, with so much money in Waikiki, ownership group should do a major facelift. Just my opinion. Aloha...

<Content>Great Hotel! I was in town for a two day conference and needed a solid hotel to spend my downtime. The Wave was recommended to me by my mother-in-law (she鈥檚 from SoCal and travels to Hawaii often) who practically insisted I stay at the hotel. She loves the property to point of spending her second honey moon here. As someone who travels extensively and usually stays at the more expensive properties, I was very impressed with Wave and its staff. The rooms really do have a 鈥渂outiquish鈥?feel and the triple sheeting on the beds is an amenity that many 4 and 5 star hotels are still lacking. The maids do a great job of cleaning the rooms and seem to really enjoy what they do. The front desk and bell staff were some of the most genuinely friendly I have encountered in my travels and really made me feel welcome every time I came back to the property. As a nice bonus, the hotel had just completed a brand new fitness room that is kept very clean and has a nice selection of equipment (for a hotel at least).Although I was at the convention center or meetings during most of my stay, I would imagine the Wave is the perfect hotel to stay at for a leisure oriented trip to Waikiki due to its proximity to the beach (less than 2 blocks) and access to the International Marketplace. Whatever your reason for visiting Waikiki is, I highly recommend the Waikiki Wave. I think you would be hard pressed to find the same mix of amenities/service/price anywhere else in the area.

<Content>Loved the room not the noise Our room was on the eighth floor facing a parking garage.and an alley called Duke's Lane where there are street vendors.The noise at night in unbelievable .. The hotel even givesyou soft earplugs that we had to upgrade ourselves to wax so wecould sleep. The alley seems to be a short cut for drunk youngpeople. We know Honolulu is noisy and have stayed atother hotels but if you are a light sleeper this is not the place tostay. The rooms were fine and the staff is friendly enough. Butthink about the noise factor before you stay here.

Lots of restaurant choices and shopping a few steps from door of hotel. Free coffee machine downstairs with option to purchase latte's, etc. Friendly and helpful staff. Beach towels for borrow, Coffee and coffee maker, tea, Chocolate Mac nuts, microwave and small frig in room upon arrival. Rooms have flat screen TV's and WiFi. We are a family of 6 people and was one of the only places that had accommadations for all 6 of us in one room with 3 queen size beds where one of the beds was in a room that had a rice screen door for privacy from the kids its own flat screen TV. Room had 2 Lanai's and updated. This was our 5th time staying here and for as much as we are in the room this hotel is perfect! Can't beat the price either. for what you get and the location. Will stay here everytime we come!

<Content>Great For The Price We had reservations at a beachfront hotel. I decided that we were not in our room enough to spend that kind of money so I started looking at other hotels. I decided on this hotel since it was recently remodeled. Yes - I read the reviews and had concerns about street noise. I heard the garbage truck one time and went back to sleep. The only other noise were the people who slammed their hotel doors and talked loud in the hall, but that happens at any hotel. Very limited parking - but we were still able to park at the hotel. The room was very clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds that I have slept in. The hotel staff was extremely nice and friendly. When we go back to Hawaii, we will stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Hotel Aqua Waikiki WaveExcellent Hotel Once again I have just returned from the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. I am,what many would call a seasoned traveler to the Islands. This was my 17th visit.This is my third stay at the Aqua Waikiki Wave. Formerly Coral reef.It has been totally remodeled in 2006, and I mean totally remodeled. (Entrance, hallways, rooms and shops have been added along with fitness center, business center, Concierge  tour desk). The rooms arelarge compared to most Waikiki Hotels in their category.The rooms have central air conditioning unlike some Hotels that have wall unit air conditioners that are very noisy and leak. Many Items that other Hotels charge for, the Waikiki Wave furnishes free. Safe,-phone calls,- morning news papers. Flat screen TV with DVD player. Also believe it or not some Hotel charge for maid service. The Wave furnishes that daily-free-.This Hotel is a jewel. Competitively priced, great location and excellent service and employees. The Beach is just a short walk through the International Market and everything else is just across the street. Internet accesses with computers are available in the lobby for a small charge

<Content>Good Hotel and Good Location My research paid off finding this place. It is only a few blocks from the ocean and right next to the international market. The rooms were nicely furnished and the beds were very comfortable. The only downside was the parking. There was limited parking beneath the hotel and overflow was in an car elevator next door. When we had to park in overflow, picking up the car would take 5 to 10 minutes.However, besides that minor inconvenience, the staff were extremely friendly and service impeccable. I would recommend this place to all....

<Content>What More Could You Ask For My partner and i stayed at the Aqua Wave in November of this year. We just loved it! For the price that you pay compared to other hotels you could not ask for more. We got a partial ocean view room which was excellent, would highly recommend spending the extra money. The beds a devine and the sheets, towels etc are all clean and new. The staff were so friendly, they even supplied you with free apples and coffee in the lobby. We found the housekeeping to be really quick, not sure if it was because we were on the top floor and they started there, but it was excellent. Close to everything you could ask for in Waikiki! As this was my first time here I looked around at other hotels which you pay premium for and they were all so old and tired, we were so glad that we choose the waikiki wave and saved our money for more shopping! Sure it doesnt have a bar or restaurant or anything attached but that was all the more reason to get out and explore Waikiki.You will not be dissapointed!!

<Content>Has its pros and cons My husband and I wanted to take our 22 month old daughter on vacation. We chose the Aqua Waikiki Wave because of decent reviews and its proximity to the beach - without being too expensive.Pros:CleanThe junior superior wave room was largeClose to shopping and restaurantsShort walk to beach (if you cut through the International Marketplace)Reasonably pricedCons:No ramp for strollers at hotel entranceContinental breakfast (part of our package) was disappointingHousekeeping was slow (on our last night they didn't get to our room)On a noisy street and near a couple of nightclubsIf you have small children, the balcony bars are dangerously wide (they have a sticker on the sliding glass door with a warning but I'd rather see them fix the bars)Hotel pool is the size of a normal residential pool - but then again why go there if the beach is a short walk awayElevators are a little slowOverall, we might stay again because we can live with the cons. If you don't have kids some of cons aren't a big deal. But we'd request a room away from the street, and higher up to try and get away from the noise.

<Content>Decent hotel- but reserve a high floor We stayed here for three nights. We are Hawaii residents so we got a discounted rate.The hotel is recently remodeled and is, in general, in good condition. However, an extra 20% effort in the rooms would have went a long way... for example replacing the old, dirty air vents or maybe some bathroom upgrades. Overall though, the room was clean and the bed slept well.This is not a resort, it is just a standard hotel, so you are basically paying for the room. The price includes easy, fast, free WiFi which is really nice considering the big resorts will really ding you for this.Many have said they had parking problems. We actually didn't go in and out a lot, but we never had issues parking. In fact, if you find a spot in their garage, it is really nice. This is the closest I've ever been able to park to my room in a Honolulu hotel. Perhaps, if you come back late you may have trouble getting a spot.Basically this is a good place to stay if you can get a good price and you don't need resort amenities. Don't underestimate some of the things the larger properties offer though. Even active folks who don't spend a lot of time in their rooms might enjoy being able to relax in the hot tub for a half hour under the stars at night in the warm tropical air. No can do this at the Wave.One other, MAJOR consideration. We were on the fourth floor and it was LOUD. I wouldn't stay here again if I couldn't get something on a high floor. Otherwise, check a property like the Ohana East and see if they have something on a high floor.

<Content>Awesome Hotel and Staff The Wave was great. The staff were awesome, very cheerful friendly  helpful. They really made our stay there nice  made us want to return. The room was a corner suite  had lots of space, bigger than any room I've stayed in before. We had a couple of small problems that were looked after right away. We faced the main street so it was a little noisy but not bad. The only complaint we had for the room is the air conditioner was blowing directly on one bed which made it cold so we had to turn it down, however then I was too warm on the other side of the room. Very impressed with the main lobby. The restaurant there is good. There are a few shops, washrooms  a comfortable place to sit while waiting for the airport bus. Also the girls booking tours are very good. We were a bit disappointed about the pool, due to it's location we didn't use it. I would have used the spa quite a bit if it would have been at our location. Didn't like the looks of the hotel where it was located. All in all we really do like this hotel. It was my friends 1st trip to Hawaii  the experience made her trip very enjoyable. I've been to Hawaii 5 times  like this hotel the best so far. We would both return here. Its also a great location!

<Content>Hey...It's OK Funky remodeled hotel about a 5 minute walk to the beach. Updated furnishings but trim (light switches, plumbing) could also use an upgrade. Friendly staff but weird housekeeping practices (I'm still trying to figure out play and rest!!) I think a quick run-through with the vacuum daily isn't too much too ask especially in sandy Waikiki. Lots of restaurants at hand (L and Lacross the street is very good for plate lunches).

<Content>10+ for location  Stayed 8 nights on the 10th floor. Views were great, room was lovely and spacious. The bathroom is TINY and looks  feels OLD, wash basin stinks, wall has badly cracked old tiles, door is chipped and has chunks of paint missing. The staff are very nice specially Marilyn our room attendant and George at the front desk, nothing was a problem for them and everything was done with a smile. The biggest problem at the property is NOISE, not even the ear plugs help and I'm not a light sleeper. First it is the pounding music from the nearby clubs then the street noise and later the garbage collectors and some crazy trumpet player at 5 am!

<Content>Bed Bugs After reading all the reviews on line, we selected the wave. We had two rooms. We reserved room 803 and 802. I unfortunately slept in room 803 and was eaten alive by BED BUGS. I told a staff member about it and she told me she would let the front desk know however no one ever followed up with me. Thank god I had another room to go to after 3 days of insect bites. I did mention this issue to Josh at the time of check out and he looked in the computer and told me that there was a note in the computer concerning the problem however no one ever changed our rooms prior to our check out date. I did receive a message from the manager a couple of hours later saying she would credit my stay for one night. It is disappointing and very unfortunate that the front desk and manager would allow people to stay in this room when they were aware of the issue a head of time.

<Content>Fabulous Waikiki Wave My trip to Waikiki Beach was perfect, in part, to my stay at Aqua Waikiki Wave Hotel. The front desk was very helpful and friendly. I arrived to find a bell man out front to carry my bags up the few steps. My room had a nice view of the ocean from the 11th floor.My room was very clean and good quality bedding and covers. The bathroom was well appointment and very clean.I have nothing but praise for the staff and my accommodations at Aqua Wave Hotel. I would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends.Only two blocks to the beach and centrally located for shopping and restaurants. What more could a girl want for a perfect Hawaii retreat!Aloha....Carrie

The staff was VERY friendly, our room was spotless every day, and we were within walking distance to great restaurants, shopping and the beach. If we go back, I would definitely consider staying at the Wave again!!!

<Content>Great Hotel Six of us had three different rooms...all were lovely and very roomy and clean. Hotels.com suggest King  rooms are on upper floors, so on arrival my king room was on the 4th floor...wanting to be higher to avoid too much street noise..JOSH at checkin organised a room on ahigher floor...no problem. The air conditioners in the rooms are VERYQUIET. Beds are wonderful, free safe in room. Use them as the balconies are close together (in case you leave the doors open). Staff are all extremely friendly. My friend left some shopping bags in a store at the Waikele Outlet Stores, we asked the bell man if he could try and arrange one of the shuttle bus drivers to pick it up for us as we could not get back out there. After some calls JAMES (the bellman) offered to drive out and pick up the bags for us. AMAZING service. Right next to international market place, GREAT POSITION would stay here again and again and again. The pool is smallbut the beach is just over a block away. There are two parking stations on Seaside Ave if you dont like the smaller spaces under the'Wave.....MAGIC!!!

<Content>The Noisy Aqua Waikiki Wave! The one word I can use to describe the Aqua Waikiki Wave is.. NOISE! I booked a room at this hotel on the glowing reviews of the other travellers, and pre-paid for my entire week with my family. Had I not done this, I would have moved hotels after the first night. To be fair to the hotel, they are a great value in price for the location, but you end up paying for it in the noise. I'm not a light sleeper by any means, but I was travelling with my wife and 10 month old boy for our first vacation. He is a light sleeper. The room doors all seemed to slam shut, so at all hours our room seemed to shake whenever any of our neighbors shut their doors. Also, the walls seemed very thin as we could not only hear, but follow conversations our neighbors, or anyone in the hallway were having. This includes the shrill screaming of kids running up and down the hallway at all hours. We were on the 14th floor and I didn't think it possible that the noise from the street and bar down below would be so prevelant. Maybe it has something to do with the single paned glass balcony doors, they did not block out any outside noise at all. Our room was adjacent to the parking garage which operated constantly, adding to the orchestra of noises. It also appeared we were close to some sort of dumpster, because at about 3:00am every morning you could hear glass bottles? being dumped in large quantities. The hotel does supply earplugs, so it appears they know there is a noise issue. There was even one day that we had just gotten our little one down to sleep when the fire alarm went off! The staff came on the intercom and said there was no fire, however the damage had already been done. I ran into one of the maintenence guys and asked him what set the alarm off, he said it was dust in the fire alarm, and he had a can of compressed air in his hand as he had just come from cleaning it out.Besides the noise, there were other reasons we will not go back to this hotel. There is a small flight of steps going from the parking garage to the street, and then a larger flight going into the hotel lobby. There is no elevator. There IS an old wheelchair lift on the flight of stairs going to the lobby, however nobody ever offered to let us use it. So my wife and I had to carry our baby and stroller up and down these steps whenever we went anywhere, while the staff watched. I believe they offered to help once.Parking. With limited parking, if you did not get back to the hotel early in the evening, you did not get a spot. Now they would reimburse your $18 if you could not find parking, but the hassle was ridiculous. I rented a small SUV for travel around the island and found that even if there was a spot open, the vehicle could not fit into some of them because they were so small!Pool. In order to get to this tiny pool you had to walk through the parking garage, an up another flight of stairs at the back of the hotel. I never saw anyone there and we found out why. The pool was dirty. Bird feathers and dead insects floated across the surface. Completely unusable in my book.The saving grace for this hotel is it's price and location. It is minutes from Waikiki Beach and the International Marketplace. If I had known better I would not have booked at this hotel with our small child. Couples or families with older children may not find the challenges we had with this hotel.

Its proximity to the Royal Hawaiian, the International Marketplace, and the Mauna Amoana Shopping Mall (sp?) were all fantastic. We like to walk and walked everywhere.The room was Spacious and very clean. The staff were courtesous and gave recommendations for restaraunts outside of the hotel, which I greatly appreciate. The checkin/checkout times were instantaneous. This will be a regular stop for future trips to the island.

<Content>Honeymoon on cloud 9 I have worked in hotels for 15 yrs. I know hospitality and this is it. Every employee said hello, good morning, good afternoon all day every day with a smile and eye contact.The girls at the Concierge desks were a god send. Location was great. Champange was a nice surprise.A fire alarm went off while we were there and the employees were helpful, calm and professional. Apples every day made for a great pick me up for all the local activities. Two blocks from the beach made for a great morning jog. The housekeepers did a great job, even on the wedding day with all the girls getting ready in our room. (What a mess)I only wish I could remember the names so you can say hello for us when you go. And you should go. This place is great and my new wife and I had a truely memorable time.Can't wait to go back.Mahalo staff for a good timeAloha

<Content>Don't expect too much The reviews below are far, far too generous, apparently written mostly by people who don't stay at very many luxury hotels and therefore have limited expectations. This is not a good hotel. It is an okay hotel at best. Still, it is also true that Honolulu as a whole has fallen on bad times and there really aren't any good hotels in Honolulu any longer. Forget the glory days of glamour at the old Kahala Hilton. Honolulu hotels now cater to the Wal-Mart set, although you couldn't tell that from their ever-rising rates. All Honolulu hotels now are old, tired, and dowdy no matter what you pay.To be fair, this hotel may well be the best choice of a very modest lot, both in terms of quality and value, particularly the latter. I would certainly choose it over any of the alternatives of which I am aware, but I emphasize this warning if you follow my recommendation: don't expect too much. It's hardly anything you would call a good hotel by world standards.

<Content>Great Experience ! WE loved this hotel because everyone was so nice and prompt, in this time we ran out of towels so when I realised we had used all the towels, I made a call and less than 2 min someone already had broght towels to my door, the service was exellent and the people extremely nice, the beach of waikiki is so beautiful and this hotel was extremelly nicely located by the beach, with many stores all over ther place, convenient for eating something diffrent everytime. We stayed at the 12th floor and we could see the mountains from one side, and the beautiful blue ocean on the other. we were in honeymoon and we also received a bottle of champagne as courtesy of AQUA WAIKIKI WAVE. I would definitly refer this hotel to anyone! I am thinking to send my brother in a vacation to Hawaii so this is definitly the place! thanks guys for all your hard work! keep up it up !

<Content>Great Hotel in every way... We stayed one night pre-cruise and were very happy with this hotel. The rooms were large, immaculate and nicely furnished.(A flat screen tv and dvd player + plus a fridge, microwave and coffee pot were some of the amenities!) A very short walk to the beach, next to a wonderful bakery and 1/2 a block from a place called Galaxy Steakhouse where a wonderful Denny's-like $2.99 breakfast can be had! I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely stay there again should we ever make it back.Also, this is a very reasonable hotel for the area and for what you get!

<Content>Great Stay My husband and I just returned from our stay at The Wave. I booked this hotel nearly a year ago in anticipation of our trip to Oahu for our 10th wedding anniversary. I was pleased to read all of the good reviews over this past year and was excited to arrive. Our flight got in early and we were able to check in right away. I was a little disappointed as I'd requested 1 King bed (nearly a year in advance) and instead, got a room with 3 queen beds since there were no King rooms available. Since it was just the two of us, it was a lot of wasted space and beds! The rooms are large (Rm 1415) and we had two balconies which was very nice. The staff was all very nice and our room attendant did an excellent job. There were two complaints on the whole trip - One, every morning at 5am, the dumpsters right under our room were emptied - VERY LOUD!! The other, we had made an appointment at the Spa but when we showed up, they had erased our name and said our appointment had been cancelled! Disappointing but they did arrange for us to have our massage the morning we were leaving and gave us a 5% discount. Overall, I would reccommend this hotel. It is close to lots of shopping and dining (Highly Reccommend Roy's, just around the corner)

Our flight arrived early so we were there earlier to check in, the front desk staff had our room ready a.s.a.p. and we were able to check in earlier. The staff at aqua waikiki wave are friendly and helpful. Our room is kept clean. We have fresh clean towels daily and our room is cleaned daily. I would definitely recommend this place.

<Content>Aqua Waikiki Wave Honolulu Thank you to all at the Aqua Waikiki Wave, our stay was just great. The room was wonderful and very clean and the Staff could not do enough for you. James and George on the door were marvellous very helpful and great personalities.I was there september 19th for 5 days with a girlfriend for her 50th.You just must do a helicopter flight over Ohau, Blue Hawaiian is the best ,unbelievable and the Grand Crcle tour. I think you should be warned to take extra cash for the stop at the Dole Platation, great shop but we were not given enough time there. Pearl Harbour a must, well organized.If you are staying in Maui as we did for 3 nights you are bestto hire a car, we walked and walked, We stayed at the Maui Banyon Resort room fantastic but then again we had an ajoining one great for a family 203 and 203A. However no lift which is hard when you have lots of bags, many steps but security were good and helped us out as we left so early. Just a tip though.A great trip to do is the Prince Kuhio to snorkle the Molokini Crater rate that 100 out of 10 crew amazing swam with the turtles right up to your face, you can hire under water digital cameras, which they put straight to disc, so that is fabulous.Enjoy, I was though very dissapointed with the helicopter over Maui as a result of the wind picking up, others who went early in the day raved but I didn't get to see the coast as I thought or go over the crater. I think you should really check this out but then again I should have gone with Blue Hawaiian.Enjoy but if you want total relaxation you need plenty of time .Oh pack a teaspoon, never saw one the entire time in Honolulu

<Content>Great Hotel Pros: Great PRICE!! a lot cheaper than other hotels in the area.Great staff, very friendly. GEORGE is the BEST!3 minute walk to the beachABC store downstairsInternational Marketplace next doorClose to many of the attractions. if you have a car rental, everything is an easy drive. if not, the buses take you everywhereRooms/bathrooms are clean.Should anything be a problem, the staff will attend to it immediately.Cons: Parking is very limited. Rather than paying the $18/day hotel rate, just pay the $10 for the garage next door (it's where the hotel sends you to park anyways).At night, there are bars and clubs around the hotel. If you are with young kids, I suggest you get them in before 9pm (this is around the time when the hookers start parading in front of the hotel).The free breakfast consists of mini muffins or mini danishes. There isn't much of a selection. However, the food at the Big Kahuna, which is where the hotel conducts their breakfast has their own menu. You get a $3 off your selection if you do get something from them.On lower floors, you hear everything in the street, hard to sleep at night. Reserve a room on a higher floor.The ocean view rooms are horrible. Since you are a block away from the beach, your view is obstructed by two large hotels and you don't get that picture perfect i'm paying for white sand/clear water view. Views are of the parking garage next door or the building on the other side.

All this at a great price to, could you ask for anything more.I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone going to Waikiki.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay! I used TripAdvisor to find the Aqua Resorts, and this was the hotel that had rooms available for the best rate. We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night and really enjoyed it. As stated in other reviews the bell staff was non existent, some of the front desk people were not excited about guest being there (others were great), and parking sucked. The room was great, very nicely updated, and the free wifi was great. The tub did need a little updating, but it wasnt bad. The cleaning people were wonderful! Leticia was our lady and she was so attentative and friendly!Everything was in walking distance that we wanted to see in Waikiki and most other stuff had transportation available, so you dont need a car. There was nightlife nearby, I was on the 12th floor and didnt notice the noise at night. And if you did you didnt do enough during the day to make you sleep well! There were hookers, if you are thinking of making a purchase beware looks may be deceiving (not all chics). The entertainment people are great they set up a luau for us and recommended other things for us.If we return to Oahu again we will definately stay at an Aqua Resort.And if you are an Inked fan the new HH is just a few doors down.

<Content>Best Bet for the Money! The Aqua Wave is perfect for a homebase in Waikiki for the money.We loved how personally attentive and courteous the staff was, the super central location and simply but stylish updated room. Everything was right where we wanted it to be (shopping, beach, food, sightseeing) and the price couldn鈥檛 have been beat for this hotel. The A/C in the room was perfect and the lanai was a nice treat. The kitchenette (fridge/coffeemaker/microwave) was kept spotlessly clean and retained cold temperature for food and milk. Overall the room was clean, the beds so comfy (nicer quality linens too!). A continental breakfast (with a pass) next door at Big Kahuna鈥檚 was a typical fare of muffin/pastry choice with juice and coffee. Apples were also available. Complimentary hassle-free beach towels were available for outings to the beach. The Aqua Wave is a great choice for the casual traveler. A minor rebuttal to the concerns of illegal activity around this area--you are in a big metropolitan area. There will always be an element of watching for your safety. I can't believe how SAFE we DID feel here even with my daughters who are 8  10. Police presence was around constantly but not in a menacing fashion as in say LA or Chicago (and we did get a laugh at the officer dancing street while keeping an eye on the clubgoers). Honolulu is a major city. Keep your wits about you and all will be fine. Hawaii is home to more sincere humans than I think I've ever met! Aloha indeed! Relax-this isn't the Mainland is a good mindset to have. Things to keep in mind of the Aqua Wave if you are highly particular:Our room was decently sized but for 4 it was snug and we thought since there were restrictions on how many to book to a room, it would have been a bit bigger. We would stay at a sister property of the Aqua next time for a Jr. suite at a relative price.The bathrooms were not ample and could鈥檝e appreciated an upgrade to the tub to match with the whole room update. Since this is a hotel in the heart of the city, there is noise from the clubs and streets well into the AM. Not recommended for a sensitive sleeper (you do get complimentary earplugs however).but then again I can鈥檛 think of too many other places in the city that are for the quiet people. Parking is a premium at $18/day and the lot fills fast, however this is not unlike any other urban environment. Savvy parkers can seek offstreet spots nearby. There is no room service but several excellent choices of eateries within steps of the hotel. One small personal dislike--smoke could be smelled in the vents and I don鈥檛 know if it is because of intake sources but to the Wave鈥檚 credit, other nice hotels I鈥檝e been at have this problem too even when they are nonsmoking. I would absolutely stay with the hotel again as a first choice with a stay for two adults at the rates I had. For a larger group, I will be happy to try the other hotels in this chain when we come back! (PS-We were there when they were shooting photos for a brochure so whenever/wherever it is published, it is an accurate depiction of the hotel.)

It was very clean, modern (although the bathtub needs to get updated) and the staff was very helpful. Be careful of having your room on the right side of the the hotel as it is next to a parking lot and and you can hear car alarms going on and off all night. Would definitely stay again!

<Content>Good Experience My friend and I stayed here last month for 7 days .. Its a nice hotel in a good location .. The rooms are kept very clean and house keeping were amazing at bringing towels up to the room very fast ! I have to say the reception staff need to improve their attitude ( the male staff were lovely and always helpful however the females were the complete opposite ) The pool is very small and was hard to find but who needs a pool when the beach is so close . I never got the continental breakfast option always used the voucher to get $3 off the menu price ! The people at the tours desk are very helpful ! Overall i would return to this hotel .. definately value for money.

<Content>wonderful honeymoon, wonderful hotel i was very reluctant to book our entire honeymoon on the Internet, but to my surprise there were no hitches and no problems with the flights and especially with the hotel.the pictures of the rooms and the hotel itself made it look very enticing for a place where we would only be spending enough time to shower and sleep at night. but once again to my surprise, the hotel was wonderful and well worth the cost, which were very reasonable. the front desk staff was great and very gracious. George and Prescilla were wonderful in answering all my many questions and guiding in the right directions, along with the other front desk staff who was great as well. Thelma and Malia were great at the concierge desk in helping us make decisions on what to do whether it was pick a luau, snorkel at hanauma bay and where to drive if we rented a car. Our room had more than enough room for ALL of our stuff that we bought and brought throughout the week. the safe was great addition since i have no idea where we would have put all valuables without it. we had a king suite which was good, but my only complaint (which only occurred on saturday, 8/25, and friday, 8/31, nights) was our room was right next to the elevator and the walls were crazy thin. so anyone coming in late from the bars could be heard perfectly through the walls. we asked for another room sunday morning, but opted just to stay put and that was okay. to the staff at aqua waikiki wave, thank you for making our honeymoon quite memorable and wonderful.

<Content>Sub-par Located on Kuhio Avenue in Waikiki, the best thing about this hotel is its central location. Though it is a long block (probably 5-6 minutes) from the beach, the hotel feels like it is in the center of the action, if Waikiki is the action you are looking for.Being in the center of the action means the hotel is loud, very loud. You can hear cars honking, trash trucks dumping, and people yelling at all hours of the day and night. Light sleepers beware. Adding to the noise were sounds coming from the vents, the source of which was never determined.The rooms are spacious enough, though the bathrooms are very tight. Getting two people in there is a challenge. More importantly, our room, as well as the hall, had a distinctively bad smell. We could eliminate the smell from the room by running the A/C, but the smell in the hall persisted throughout our stay.Parking is expensive ($18) a day and it runs out if you try and park in the evening. When the regular parking runs out, you must use the parking elevator located next to the hotel.We never saw the pool, primarily because you had to walk through the parking deck in the back of the hotel to reach it. All in all, this is a budget option, and it shows. I have rarely stayed in a louder hotel and one with stranger smells. As such, I don't recommend it. There must be better optons at similar prices.

<Content>WORST HOTEL IN HOHOLULU From July1-52007  Our experience was less than perfect. First there was no bell service if you needed help with your baggage forgrt it there was none. No convienent parking only 54 spots unless you wanted to park in an alley or at the Trade Center one and a half blocks away. Hooker district. We were not informed about other wise we would not have stayed here. The staff was not very helpful at all.  Mary

<Content>Wave was exactly as advertised After reading reviews, we thought this hotel would be a good fit for our young adult sons and their two friends. And it was. It was close to restaurants, nightclubs, shopping and the beach. They explored the area on their own most of the time. We had reserved two rooms and they upgraded a room to a three queen/1 bedroom suite, so my wife and I didn't have to share our room! The suites are very spacious, which is a luxury if you've experienced a cramped hotel room. The maid service was fantastic, and my wife's highest priority was a clean hotel. They vacuumed the halls every day and were cleaning the outside of the room doors one day. The beds and sheets were luxurious. I slept better here than home. We also had no problem with the parking. We were able to get a spot under the hotel every night. But I suspect you have to get back by 6PM (which we did). We would then walk to get dinner. Some nights, we would walk a few steps to the international food plaza and grab some Korean BBQ or teriaki (at the Aloha Grill, $7). Other nights we went to Dukes, Keoni at Ohana East Hotel or The Big Kahuna at the Wave (hint: turn down the rock music so we can talk at dinner). The only complaint, which we already knew about, was the noise in this area due to AM construction and garbage trucks. But this wasn't a hotel problem. One night, someone near the hotel was recycling glass bottles into a steel bin at 4:30 AM. This only happened once though. I think Wiakiki could really use a noise pollution plan, though. Anyone who's stayed in the heart of Wiakiki knows about the 6AM wakeup call from the garbage truck beepers, even if you're staying at an expensive beach hotelThe Wave had an interesting mix of people. We saw alot of younger couples, young singles, older couples, not too many young kids. It turned out to be a great pick for our older kids. This isn't a resort hotel, but who needs a big pool when the Pacific Ocean is a block and a half away. And the price is right.

<Content>Wonderful experience!! I booked my flight and hotel about half a year in advance and let me tell you I have been checking reviews on tripadvisor everyday in regards of Aqua Waikiki Wave. Some made me nervous but both my boyfriend and I are extremely satisfied with our stay at the wave! I asked for a king bed in advanced and it was taken care of but when we arrived the room was on the 2nd floor and cramped so we asked the lady at the front desk if we could get a room on a higher level. She did it without any hesitation which was wonderful and needless to say our room on the 7th floor wonderful! The room was very clean and that is extremely important to me! I am a germaphobic ( I bring colorox wipes and gloves to sanitize everything) and this room definitely met my standards. The staff is very helpful especially James who helped us with our heavy luggage! My boyfriend and I agreed that we'd love to stay here again when we come back to Oahu! One more thing! It's in a very convenient location! Close to the restaurants, international market, and very walkable to the beach! It gets a little rowdy at night but so do most places in every city. The only that that knocked off one star is the fact that they don't have a ramp in the front making it challenging to bring your luggage up and down. Despite that, our overall experience was wonderful.

<Content>Holiday From Hell!!! When we arrived at the hotel at 10am we were informed that we could not get into room until 3pm, when we asked if we could get a drink we were told there was a shop outside the hotel. Room overlooked multi storey car park that operated 24/7 the noise was unbearable. Swimming pool a complete disgrace filthy cigarette butts in the pool, rubbish, no umbrella's very few sun lounges, very small to accomodate a 15 floor hotel containing 300 rooms. Breakfast was to be delivered to our room each day which never happened and we were offered a continental b/fast at a restaurant outside the hotel that was terrible and consisted of STALE FOOD. The contents of the brochure was a complete lie and fabricated and we would never return to Honolulu unless the hotel was located on the beach not loke this one which was three blocks away from the beach.

<Content>Great Hotel How could anybody possibly complain about this hotel? First off the hotel is in a GREAT location. 1 block and half from Waikiki Beach, minutes from bars/clubs and litterally steps from the International Market Place. There's great places to eat wether your on a budget or want to splurge. The staff at this hotel were so nice, helpful and were always smiling. The hotel was constantly being clean not even leaving a grain of sand when everyone comes back from the beach. They let you check out beach towels daily and our room was kept spotless even though we left it a little messy at times (sorry). There was plenty of room ni the rooms which included a microwave, dvd player, flat screen and fridgerator. I could go on and on about how great this hotel was we had absolutely no complaints. I had several friends staying at this hotel on this trip and every sigle one of them said they're gonna book the same hotel next time. Same with my girlfriend and I. Thanks for making our visit a great one Aqua Waikiki Wave. Special thanks to Leynette Eastman for making my porposal vacation a special one. Mahalo and we'll see you in a year.

<Content>Loved The Aqua Waikiki Wave We were made very welcome. The hotel was teriffic the staff were very welcoming, nothing was a bother to them. We travelled from Western Australia and could not have asked for better. We joined my brother and his wife here whom I know also thought this was the best hotel we had ever stayed at in Honolula, we have visited the island six times and stayed at 5 star hotels but this hotel was just perfect.The rooms were large with plenty of room, kept well clean, if you had the slightest problem the staff were there within no time to resolve.Joshu a big thank you to you and all the staff.Wishing you all the very best hope to come back one day.Sam and Hannah Western Australia

<Content>A1 Hawaiian experience My husband  I have just returned from Honolulu (we are from Australia). We were visiting our son and his girlfriend who both live in California. It was our son' s 30th birthday so it was a special occasion.Waikiki Wave was just great - the most friendly staff we have ever experienced. Nothing was ever a problem, and no matter what time of day or night, a cheery Aloha greeted us every time.The rooms were modern and very clean.The hotel itself a very short walk from Waikiki Beach.This destination is definitely a do again one.Well done, Aqua Waikiki Wave.

<Content>Wow! This Hotel is Smashingly Superb! Our family of four from Penang, Malaysia stayed at Aqua Waikiki Wave for 4 nights (Aug 6th - 10th 2007) in our first-ever tour of the Hawaii and what a smashing experience it had turned out for us. It's a unanimous double-thumbs up from the 4 of us for Aqua Waikiki Wave (AWW) for living up beyond our expectations in its standard of value-added accommodation, front-office service and room service. We opted for the deluxe room on the 15th floor which offered a partial bluish seaview.Additionally, AWW is strategically and centrally located to most of the top-rated touristic must-sees and other coveniences: a. We did our whole-day Grand Circle Island Tour (not-to-be-missed itinerary for first-timers) and the pickup is just around-the-corner from the AWW; b. the bustling, colourful and bargainful International Market Place is just a few yards away and the stall owners are ever so professional, never scornful towards us for not completing any purchase; c. the world-famous Waikiki beach is just a few blocks away (we have the world-famous Batu Ferringhi beach at home but nothing beats the Waikiki Beach that is so FULL of people and activities. There is even a police beat base there to provide a great sense of security. On our second day of our visit to the beach, there was even a good samaritan standing near the beat base informing and cautioning us about the presence of jelly fish. Wow!)d. TheBus, a most convenient transportation in Oahu, has its stops just in front of and across from the AWW (We went to Chinatown and the very nice and upscale Ala Moana Shopping Center using this very affordable mode of transportation).e. A great bakery, St Germain, is just next door. (We ordered a wonderful birthday cake from them and was delivered to us on time.).f. The omnipresence of the ABC stores within Waikiki is greatly welcome and there's one with very friendly staff next to AWW. (We bought some of our souvenirs here as they are very reasonablly-priced.)g. AWW is also very near to reasonably-priced eateries. (We got to try the one at the corner of Seaside Av/Kuhio opposite the hotel for our breakfast for only $3 plus including coffee and the other one at less than $10 for all-you-can-eat buffet lunch on Kuhio opposite the AWW on the right.In summary and on behalf of my family, I would to thank Lynette, the GM of AWW, from the bottom of our hearts for making our check-in, accommodation and Aloha vacation so smooth, memorable and wonderful.Best regards, Patrick

<Content>Wonderful at the Wave We had booked over the internet one night only at the Wave and immediately extended our stay for the rest of the week. The front desk staff was so helpful and accommodating and efficiently booked us into our original suite for the remaining nights and at an even better rate than we had originally booked. Our room was perfect with three double beds and one bedroom. Great for a family of four with two teenagers. It was impeccably clean with beautiful cotton bedding. Our maid service was wonderful and efficient as we chatted with her on a daily basis, to return to our room to find cookies on the beds. The location is fabulous. The hotel is directly beside a short cut to the beach - only 2 blocks and beside the International Market Place. There are excellent breakfast places right across the street. Overall, we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for excellent accommodations at a reasonable price. We will return to the Aqua Wave and look forward to their friendly greetings and willingness to go out of their way to make their guests comfortable and happy.

<Content>Aqua Wave Waikiki - great hotel We arrived at the Aqua Wave having travelled from San Francisco. The staff on the check in desk were very friendly and helpful. We had requested 4 rooms close together as we were two families travelling together with teenagers. We were allocated rooms on the 8th floor - all close together. The rooms had a small balcony but unfortunately this overlooked a carpark. However the rooms were spacious and comfortable and were equipped with tea/coffee making facilities and a fridge. The bathrooms too were good - and the showers excellent. The lifts/elevators in the hotel are very fast - which we appreciated!! The hotel is located a couple of blocks from the beach and a shortcut through the market makes the short walk very pleasant. The staff throughout the hotel were courteous and friendly. All in all - a very good hotel - not too far from the beach and within walking distance of many good restaurants, bars and shops. If you don't want to pay the high prices for a beach front hotel - then the Aqua Wave is an excellent option.

<Content>Kama驶aina Loves the Wave Awesome! We rarely stay in Waikiki becaue of the touristy-ness of it all, but we were very pleased with the entire Aqua experience. Rooms are fabulous - comfortable beds, strong water pressure in the showers, cold and quiet air conditioner, plush clean towels! And the service - the staff was so right on! Maika驶i loa especially to Josh who made our stay extra special. We checked in at about 9pm and he was so kind and patient with us and our crying 9 month old, answered all of my questions and even made an extra effort to deliver our towels personally. I forgot to get the bellman驶s name as well (July 23rd, 2007 @ 9:00pm) He too was very accomodating helping us haul our 7 pieces of furniture up to the room. Telling all of our Moloka驶i 驶ohana about you!

<Content>Horrible parking situation I hadn't been to Hawaii in ten years, and I wanted to try a new place to stay. We booked at the last minute and found the AQUA Waikiki Wave with open rooms within four days of leaving for our trip. The good news: remodeled rooms, nicely appointed. The bad news: their garage. Insane. We had a rental car and paid the $18 day to park there. But paying for parking does not guarantee you a space. Trust me on this one. We came back from a day touring the island twice and were shut out. Now, they will reimburse you if you have to park elsewhere, but that's not the point. If I pay to park at the hotel, I want to park at the hotel. How hard is it to just sell the number of spots you have? When I mentioned that to the front desk people, they were like...oh yeah....that would work. And another post talked about the hookers in front of the hotel. I've been to Vegas and plenty of other hot spots, and have never seen so many blatant in-your-face opportunities to purchase sex. Made me laugh. Where are the cops? Great for tourism. I think it's my last time at the Wave.

<Content>Fantastic stay at Aqua Waikiki Wave Our romantic getaway to the Aqua Waikiki Wave hotel for our 18th wedding anniversary was absolutely fantastic. Having stayed in Waikiki numerous times in the past, we were pleasantly surprised by the sumptuously spacious accommodations that the Aqua Waikiki Wave hotel offered in the heart of Waikiki (which is certainly not the case in many other hotels in the area). The front desk staff were wonderfully warm, friendly, always smiling and anxious to offer their assistance. The location was truly fantastic as we were in walking distance to everything, the beach, great restaurants and club venues, so much so that our car never left the parking lot! I would definitely recommend this hotel to other couples and even families visiting Waikiki!!

<Content>Great Boutique Waikiki Hotel For a moderate priced property in a great location, you can't beat the Waikiki Wave in Honolulu. The rooms, though small, were clean and fresh with all the necessary amenities and a few extras such as microwave and frig. Located directly behind the International Marketplace, it's an easy walk to Waikiki Beach. There are a lot of smaller restaurants near by as well as many of the national chain brands. Eating on a budget is definitely possible. The staff at the front desk and concierge desk were very freindly and extremely helpful. Our only complaint was with the bell service. The entrance to the hotel is up a steep flight of stairs. When we arrived there was no bellman on duty so we had to haul our luggage up these stairs on our own. Not fun! As a travel agent, I am particularly critical of the places I visit. I would definitely recommend this hotel for my more moderate clientele. I think when the spa facility is completed, this will be even a better value.

<Content>Good value for Waikiki Stayed from Jul 19-23 in double room on 14th floor (with 2 balconies) and I have to say that for the money, the property is a good value for Waikiki. Almost next door to back-end of International Marketplace on Kuhio, and only a block to beach it is convenient to nearly everything. Hotel staff at front desk and housekeeper on our floor were extremely friendly, helpful and did their job very well. Room was very clean and modern (remod in last year or two?) -- with a somewhat smallish bathroom -- and other than the standard hotel door-slams in the hallways all hours, was fairly quiet and peaceful. I've taken ear plugs with me on trips for years as people just do not consider others with the doors in all but the finest properties that I've stayed at -- and with those, usually the doors are either very carefully padded and/or the closers dampened to prevent the jarring slams. If they were to address this issue, this property would be nearly perfect. Microwave, refrig and coffee maker in the room, with free safe (large enough for laptop, cameras, etc) and free WiFi are considerate value-added touches many places still feel the need to nickel and dime you to death with. Coffee replenished daily, though if you like more than a cup or two (it is 4 cup coffeemaker) you might want to bring 4 Cup Mr Coffee round filters with you as these are not supplied and a box of 100 costs about $3.50 at ABC store (we only stayed 4 nights, so that purchase wasted a lot of filters). A/C is central and kept the room quite comfortable, which is much better than window units that several economy properties have in Waikiki. There can be some hooker activity along a good stretch of Kuhio after hours (10 PM until 6AM) but certainly not a reason to discount the property, even if traveling with children.

<Content>Great place We stayed here for a week in March for our honeymoon. It was a great place to stay and the staff were really helpful. We arrived at 1am and the only room they had left was on the 3rd floor. We took it and the guy on reception told us to request a room change in the morning. We did that and got a room on the 12th floor. It was great except the balcony is really scary to stand on at that height! The staff were really kind and friendly.The complimentary toiletries are fab and I still have some that I use when I want to be reminded of Hawaii.The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is that the people on the Expedia desk are extraordinarily rude. One woman told us we wouldn't get into Pearl Harbour unless we went mega early in the morning on one of her tours. We went at lunchtime and had absolutely no problem getting in. Another lady was really rude when we booked car hire through her. While we were discussing timings with each other, she was loudly yawning and tapping her fingers on the desk. We couldn't believe that a grown adult would do that. The travel bods are the only negative aspects to the hotel and I would have no qualms about returning.

<Content>Highly Dissatisfied! Very Misleading! Unfortunately, my family was sent to the Aqua Waikiki Wave because the 1 bedroom condo that we had reserved since January was unavailable at the Aqua Island Colony. Mind you, we had called to confirm our reservation 5 days prior to arriving in Hawaii and were never informed that the hotel was overbooked for the week that we had reserved it for. When we went to check into the Colony, we were told that the Wave would be an upgrade and the rooms had been newly renovated and modernized. When we checked into the Wave, we realized that it was not an upgrade at all. The room was not a 1 bedroom condo with a kitchen as we had paid for and were promised. We had also booked a room with a view of Diamond Head. Instead, our room had a view of the parking lot and it had badly soiled carpeting and dirty linen. When I tried to get our roomed changed at the Wave I was informed by the front desk that it was also overbooked and that they could not guarantee that we would be moved to another room the next day. I was told that there was no waiting list and that I would have to plead my case with a manager in the morning. Therefore, I contacted the sister hotel, the Aqua Island Colony which was the location where I had expected to stay at. They told me that there wasn't a manager available and that we would have to wait until the next day. We were never offered maid service to clean the room and were never told that because we had been down graded to a motel like atmosphere that we would be compensated for the price difference. Hence, we made arrangements to stay at a different location.  The next day we were contacted be an assistant manager, Ginger who asked me what could they do assist us for our inconvenience. The only request that I had made was that we would be refunded the money which we had paid the travel agent. She told me that I would have to ask the travel agent for our money back and that the hotel was not billing him for our stay. I had asked her to please contact him to assure that we would we get a refund. Later that day, I heard back from the assistant manager and she informed me that the General manager was willing to pay for our stay at the Pacific Beach hotel, which is where we relocated to. She told me that he was really sorry for the mix up and that they would not bill the Travel agent for the funds. She told me that I would need to notify him for my refund. This conversation ensued during a Saturday afternoon. On Monday, I when the travel agent finally called my husband back he told him that the hotel was billing him and that Ginger had told him that I was unreasonable. I had never asked the hotel to pay for my stay and I only wished for a refund. Instead, I felt victimized of a scam. Ginger had turned our conversation around and made it sound like I was looking for a free vacation. The room that we ended up staying in the Pacific Beach was less expensive than that the travel agent had charged us. It was a nicer location and was clean. When I was informed that the general manager of the Colony of the price difference that was due to us he disregarded my request.  My intentions for staying at the Aqua Colony was to stay in a condo and feel more at home in Waikiki. Instead, I was given the run around and was treated indifferently. I would never recommend either the Colony or its sister location the Wave. The pictures on the internet are also deceitful.This was my third visit to Oahu and I had never dealt with such a lack of good service.It left me with a bad impression. Thankfully, the Pacific Beach was accomodating and we would definetly recommend them and the Outrigger Waikiki, where we had previously stayed with. to anyone.

<Content>Great hotel, great location!!! We stayed at the Waikiki Wave from July 3-10, in a 1 bedroom room on the 6th floor and it was great !! For a second there I thought we had gotten a suite because I didn't expect the room to be so big for a 1 bedroom. Our view from our 2 balconies was of the parking lot across the street but we didn't care. The room had a big living room area with a fold out couch and a seperate bedroom area for the queen size bed. A Japanese style sliding door seperated the bedroom from the living room so this room could def sleep 3-4 comfortably. The room appeared to be remodeled because the furniture and fixtures were modern. The bathroom was a little tight but what hotel room bathrooms aren't right? The tub drained as it's supposed to, not like some of those other older hotel rooms where you're standing in 3 inches of water as you shower. The room and hotel was always kept clean. Fridge, microwave, free safe and wireless internet was great!! I suggest making a run to Walmart out there and stock up on water, drinks, snacks and microwaveable meals to save yourself some time and money when wanting a quick bite or drink. A good thing about the hotel was that it was secure. You needed your room key to enter the hotel from 10pm - 6am so only guests could gain access. The garage was a little tight and sort of small but we usually found a parking space. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel is located right behind the Beachcomber, next to and behind the Int Market Place on Kuhio Ave. There's a Jamba Juice, Starbucks and a Jack-in-the-box across the street. I've been to HI several times and this by far was the best hotel for the money I've ever stayed at. For about $110 a night, it might be a little more than other budget hotels but you'll be glad you stayed there. We will def stay at this hotel in the future!!

<Content>Clean and Beautiful Remodeled Hotel Wow! This hotel truly made our stay in Honolulu a special one. There were 4 women travelers in my group. We had been told that the hotel was recently remodeled, but we didn't expect our room to look that great and be so clean. It was beautiful! New decor, carpet and paint. And best of all, the beds were very, very comfortable and that is coming from someone who has a tough time staying in other beds. The personnel was extremely nice and location couldn't have been much better. There was some noise from the streets below but nothing that kept us awake. I truly plan to revisit this hotel next time around.

<Content>The Wave Gave A Wonderful Impression We recently returned from an almost 20-yr absence of Hawaii. First off, after getting off the plane from a week-long stay at Hilo we were naturally tired, so to fight off the jetlag we went to visit the Naval Exchange (a friend of ours is in the military) and then did some sightseeing. The Wave is not obvious when trying to find it -- I do agree that they need to deal with that-- but, we did find parking within their parking garage (this was around 8pm or so). And this is with a minivan and a car. The lobby was immaculate with its marble-like floors and bright lighting. A couple of disappointing features was that they were still renovating the first floor--this will contain the fitness center and other amenities like a spa--and that there is no elevator access from the garage to help deliver your luggage to the lobby. The room that we were booked in had 3 queen size beds. The bathroom was small, but it was sufficient. Also, I forgot to mention that both were also immaculate upon arrival.The staff were wonderful and friendly. They answered with respect and dignity.(Now if y'all are wondering about the noise level, it is next door to the International Market Place, so the obvious noise level of it being loud was during Saturday night. But, I was so tired that I slept right through it. The other nights were pretty quiet.)If I go back to Honolulu, this is the place I would stay at.

<Content>Perfect base for Waikiki Beach We stayed for 3 nights and could not fault this hotel at all. Friendly staff, excellent accommodation and plenty of room. We picked this hotel after reading comments on Trip Advisor and what a good choice. We stayed on the 8th floor and had no problem with any outside noise. Would recommend this. Thank you Aqua Wave for making our stay so good.

<Content>Don't waste your money$$$ Don't waste your money on this awful hotel. We read the reviews on all the hotels in Waikiki and opted to stay at the Wave for one night before moving to our rental on the North Shore. After arriving in Hononlulu around 8pm we made our way to the hotel. There was no parking available and after calling twice the front desk told us to park next door. Do you wonder why there are no photos of the front of the hotel? It was hard to find and it looked like a hostel. The crowd in front of the hotel was scary and loud. Not for children to see. The hotel is also at the back of the International Market Place..the way back. Prostitutes and party people were all over the place. After parking 10 minutes away we made our way to the front desk and checked in. We requested a certain room and were told that the room was occupied. I called four days ahead to confirm reservation, that didn't matter to the rude man at the front desk. He informed me that they had no other rooms and I was stuck with this room. The airport lost our luggage and we told him this but he was very unsympthetic to our situation not even offering us a toothbrush. The lobby was cheap and dirty looking wouldn't consider it a real lobby..only about four chairs spread apart from each other. Please think twice before booking this hotel. Don't waste your money!

<Content>The Best HoneyMoon Ever My new wife and I stayed at the Aqua Wave on May 7th that night the parking garage was making to much noise and we had traveled from South Berwick, Maine. We needed sleep. In the morning the hotel traded rooms for us as well as upgraded us to a king room. Get this room it is worth the extra money. All of the shops and hotels in the area are very friendly. Be careful late at night, however we never had a problem.There is a lot of tourist shopping in the area and the outdoor market is right next door. Whatever you do check out the pastry shop located 2 doors down. So good and very inexpensive for a breakfast meal in your room. The Halekalani also has a dining atmosphere that is outstanding. Located inside go to the restaurant Room without a key so good you cant stand it. Please say hi to Josh and Prescilla at the front desk. Josh is a credit to the hotel his service was outstanding. Prescilla is a gem and gorgeous at the same time. Such great people.

<Content>Delightful stay from June 22nd to 26th We had booked at another hotel earlier this year, but as the months went by, the cost of the hotel kept going down and down which made us fishy about how the condition of the hotel might be. My husband found the Aqua Waikiki Wave and we read reviews and decided to book it based on what we read--that it was newly renovated. We really enjoyed it. We had three queen beds and had our own little room with sliding panels for somewhat privacy. We have three young children who woke up really early so it was nice to have that room. The only thing was as others have stated, even though we were up on the 9th floor, we could hear the busy-ness and noise of things below. But the kids were sound sleepers, so it was okay for us. Also, we didn't know where the parking lot was (it was at the driveway immediately after the hotel.) The bathroom was partly renovated, the shower/tub was not new and the bathroom itself was a bit cramp, but it was bearable. I hope they will upkeep the cleaniless of this hotel because we would love to come back to it again! And as others have noted, it is convenient to a lot of places: a bakery, an ABC store, Starbucks, Jamba Juice, International Market, LL, Chii's, Jack in the Box, not too far of a walk to Waikiki Beach (about a block and a half) and though the staff did not know, there will be opening a Puka Dog soon which is very close by, which we unfortunately did not get to try.

<Content>The Aqua Waikiki Wave was fabulous Aqua Waikiki Wave exceeded my expectations. The staff are friendly and really make you feel welcome. I stayed for 10 nights and I enjoyed every single day. The rooms are gorgeous and have amazing views. I would definately stay here again. If you ever want to check Hawaii out, then stay at the Waikiki Wave or any Aqua hotel. This was the second Aqua hotel that I have stayed at and I have been happy with the service both times. Kuhio avenue is only 5 minutes from the beach so if you want value for money and great service then stay at the Wave.

<Content>Great Find!! We usually book online and this stay was not any different. We booked through itravel2000.com and found the Aqua Waikiki Wave Hotel. We stayed there from June 15-17, 2007. Great hotel!Let me give some feedback.Pros - Great rooms- very nicely decorated - very modern- included were flat screen TV's and DVD player- fridge and microwave. - Friendly staff- great location..walking distance to waikiki, international market and grocery stores, restaurants.Cons - pool. very small and in an akward place.This was not that important to us since waikiki beach is only 5 minute walk. - fitness center is under construction - but not a big deal.I definately stay here again, for the price and what you get, you can't beat it. Make sure you go to Duke's to eat.

<Content>Great experience I stayed in a King size room on the 8th floor.This has been one of my most pleasant hotel experiences I have had. It was almost all troublefree. All the staff are the most friendliest and helpful I have ever had. Nothing was too much trouble and they also help plan your holiday in their business section.I arrived early before checkin at 2PM. With heavy jetlag they got me a nice room early.The room was much bigger than I expected, and very clean. Some nice touches include an iron (and board), a microwave, a safe, wireless broadband which works quite well and a DVD player. This was my first time in the US, so it is difficult to compare it with other US hotels, but this one definitely met all my expectations.Probably the only problem I could find was that my in-room phone would randomly ring 2 or 3 times. And this occured one night at 4AM and then 5AM on another. Never got to the phone in time to ever answer, but this was a little annoying. But I can't say whether this was something the hotel could have fixed anyway. On some nights you could hear some noise coming from the lower streets, but nothing to stop someone who is reasonably tired from sleeping.Oh and some for advise for anyone out there booking through bookit.com. I will never go through this website again. On booking I got error messages coming up, so I kept retrying until giving up. Then I found out I had booked 5 times. The website resolved this problem for me, but the customer service was very very slow to respond and the website failed to book some add-on packages I chose.Did someone say something about a pool?? Never even knew there was one!A very enjoyable 3 night stay, especially for the price.

<Content>aqua waikiki wave - great hotel Stayed at the Waikiki Wave from 18 May till 13 June 2007. Normally stayed at the Prince Kuhio but since it was bought over by the Hilton chain it has overpriced itself. Found this hotel on the internet which had went through a major refurbishment and reckoned this was the best time to try it out. This proved to be a wise decision as we found this little gem of a hotel just like our second home - this was mainly due to the excellent staff that is employed here - we have never been in a hotel that made us so welcome as the staff - they are ambassadors for the AWW. Special thanks to Josh at reception who always made our day with his lovely smile. Malia who was based at the activities desk and was always so helpful. The guys at the front door were always helpful with their knowledge of the surrounding areas. Finally our maid Julie who always kept our room spick and span and welcomed you with her cheery personality. Well done to the manager who interviewed and took on all of the staff as everyone was a pleasure to talk to.The room is big with 2 queen beds and has flat screen tv, microwave, fridge, hairdryer, ironing board  iron. The hotel is sited in the heart of Waikiki and you will experience some noise from the local night clubs. The beds are a dream and if I could buy one in Scotland I would have one the same in my home.Overall our stay was brilliant and we would definitely come back and stay in AWW despite the noise.Only negative comments were it was not much of a pool but we were informed that a new pool is on the cards which would be great for future visits.

<Content>stay here only for value and location, not looks or luxury Let's face it: Hawaii is expensive. With all the major hotels being in the several hundred $$$ per night, Waikiki Wave is only slightly over $100. However, despite the boutique hotel logo and website appearance and a renovation (which i would just call slight remodeling), the rooms/facilities not cool or hip, and are nothing more than a 3 star standard---only it benefits from a great location (in the heart of Waikiki, you can't get better than this), and a smiling staff.The rooms are spacious (2 queen size beds) but the decor is pretty pathetic. maroon printed carpeting, furniture that shows wear, dark bathroom, etc. The room is clean enough, but not 5-star pristine. Bathroom has yellow lighting, is cramped, and feels claustrophobic. Mirrors have some fingerprints if you look carefully. The one bonus is that the linens are extremely clean and there is no gross puffy bedspread that you fear will never be washed---instead there is a waffle weave blanket sandwiched between 2 flat sheets --- brilliant. There is NOTHING romantic about this room. I would not recommend this for couples looking for a fantasy getaway b/c you will be disappointed upon seeing this room. Instead, splurge the extra $$$ and go to the Halekulani Hotel which is just breathtaking.I would recommend this place to groups of budget-conscious friends (not couples) looking for an inexpensive place to stay---a clean bed and a place to crash. You cannot beat this location as it is close to everything--as i said, it's in the heart of this area and everything is within walking distance--shops, the beach, other hotels, etc.No need to visit the pathetic pool which is *shudder* out by the parking garage. it is a sad, wading-pool-like small triangle of water that hasn't been skimmed in weeks. The gym was being renovated at the time so the staff gave me access to a 24-hour fitness (which faces Waikiki beach), only a 10 minute walk from the Waikiki Wave. Staff is typical Hawaiian, accommodating and nice, pretty good service, no attitude.If looking for a nice beach restaurant, i recommend the Hula Grill which is above Duke's Restaurant. This restaurant overlooks the beach from the 2nd floor and at night is quite romantic. PROS:-budget friendly-awesome location: close to beach, food, shops, etc.-clean beds and linens-nice staffCONS-rest of the room is um...motel-ish but not overly gross-not romantic for a vacation getaway-feels cheap

<Content>Great renovated hotel My husband and I stayed the week of May 2nd for 5 nights and enjoyed every day. This is my second review as I made a slight mistake in my first one and thought it was important enough to correct it. I asked for an upgrade when we arrived and was given a 10th floor balcony room and it looked just like the pictures on the website. The view was not special but the balcony was great since the price was right. The staff was great ,Rachel and Darryl at the front desk were always helpful and gave us great information for our drive to the Noth Shore. Vinnie the bell/doorman was always friendly and there are stairs at the door and he was alway available to help you with your packages or luggage and they have a chairlift too. There was a concierge who helped us arrange our rental car whch was very convenient. The beds were super comfortable and I liked the idea of a sheet as a bedspread so you know it gets washed. You can still tell it is older hotel but the renovations were done quite well and the location is great. The street in front is quite busy and lot's of clubs and places too eat up and down and nearby, only 2 blocks to the beach and all the big name hotels with big prices. The International Market down the street great place to shop for fun take home gifts and the Big Kahuna next door also good for quick food and bar drinks. We used the bus and the  trolly  service quite a few times and the stops are almost just out the front door. The hotel had the right price, good location and great beds this was our 1st trip to Hawaii and I was not disappointed with our hotel we would go back and stay there again and reccomend it to our friends and family.

<Content>Great hotel for the price Stayed at the Waikiki Wave for 6 nights 5/28-6/3. This hotel is in a great location, a little over a block from Waikiki beach. I am not sure I would pay extra for the ocean view as there isn't really an unobstructed ocean view from here as there are other buildings just as tall if not taller in the way. We could see a small sliver of the ocean from our room on the top, 15th floor. We were on the street side and the noise on the street in the night was noticeable a time or two but nothing unbearable. The beds are really comfortable and the rooms are good size. I love that the beds are double sheeted and no nasty comforters touching any part of you! There is a bus stop right in front on Kuhio Ave. There is a coffe maker, fridge  microwave in the room which is a plus. There is also a Starbucks practically across the street and ABC stores on nearly every side within a block. The $3 off coupon at Da Big Kahuna for breakfast was a nice perk too, we ate there a couple of mornings. The local newspaper is brought to the doors of each room every morning. There was one night where there was a rowdy group in the hallway in the middle of the night but that's not really the hotels fault. The pool is teeny tiny and at the back of the parking garage so if you want a pool, go elsewhere. Who needs a pool when the beach is right there though? Beach towels are given out at the front desk. All of the staff we encountered was really friendly. I would definitely return to this property or recommend it to someone else.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel in Waikiki If you are looking for the full resort experience with - lounging around a pool and waiters bringing you drinks with umbrellas while a Hawaiian band serenades you - this is not the place. If you want to spend $100s less, still be in the thick of things, and have a clean, comfortable place to stay, the Waikiki Wave is the hotel for you.We had a Deluxe Wave on the 9th floor facing the Waikiki Trade Center (Ewa direction). Others have complained about the noise, but I found it no noisier than staying in New York or San Francisco.The rooms are spacious and well appointed. What is advertised on their website is exactly what you get. The refrigerator and microwave are wonderful additions to any room for storing cold water and leftovers from our plate lunches and reheating them for a mid-day snack.It's true that this is an older, renovated property, but the only sign of this is in the hallways. But who really cares if you can see multiple layers of paint in the hallways??Free WI-FI is a bonus. I had problems loosing connectivity to the Internet (stayed connected to the WAP, but could not browse), filled out a comment card regarding this, and saw a technician reprogramming the WAPs the very next day. That's service.The only downside I found with the hotel was the parking situation. It's amazing to see how many SUVs and full-size cars try to park in spaces barely wide enough for a compact car. I actually watched a minivan attempting to pull into one of the spaces - it took 2 lookouts to direct the driver and 5 whole minutes before the feat was accomplished. Rather than using the parking below the hotel ($18/night with in/out privileges), we chose to use the public parking facility (attached to the Waikiki Town Center) located in alleyway leading to the hotel's parking. The bonus is that public parking is only $10/night (no in/out privileges) and the same exact facility is used by the hotel as overflow parking (at the $18/night charge). So do yourself a favor and park at the public lot. It's easier that way.Overall, I don't think you'll find another hotel that offers the friendly service and comfort for the price that you'll pay at the Wave. We'll definitely return again.

<Content>Great hotel! My husband and I stayed here from 4/24-5/6/07  had a great time. This was our second stay on the island  we wanted to put our money to better uses other than an overpriced beachfront room the size of a closet. The rooms were very large, extremely clean  the Aqua kit was very convenient. The staff was wonderful  always willing to help out. The only improvements that should be done is the hotel should put an ice maker on at least a couple of floors (currently you must go to front desk), and maybe offer some laundering services. The bath products are amazing- they should offer the products for sale at the desk. After dark the area is prone to prostitution  drug dealings. The street is very loud because of the nightclubs but the hotel does an excellent job securing the property: after 9pm the doors are closed  can only be entered with a room key. Overall I would most likely stay again, and am looking forward to it. Mahalo!

The Aqua Waikiki Wave was a great place to stay, central to everything and very comfortable. Wonderful reception and ground floor staff. Rooms clean, neat and tidy and easy to sleep in. Would definately go back.

<Content>We'll stay with Aqua Wave anytime ! We booked the hotel through our Australian travel agent strictly on location鈥撯€?as wished to be in centre of Waikik and didn't know what to expect ( except reviews we had read on tripadvisor). We arrived at 10 am after about 14 hrs on planes from Perth WA absolutely exhausted. And that is when our love affair with AWWH began.The smiling reception staff made a big effort to find us a room earlier than the 2pm check-in which saved our lives. We were shown to our room which was large,light and contained two Queen-sized beds...perfect. The hotel is the perfect place for holidaying in Honolulu close to the beach, restaurants, shopping and transport if you don't have a car.We were taking a cruise and had no hesitation in trying to book again for this hotel at its end. Again we arrived early after the cruise hoping to store our bags and much to our delight were able to go straight to our room. Wonderful hotel, great staff and lovely rooms (including beds) 10/10

<Content>Good place to stay For the AAA rate we got a partial ocean view for $113/nite. It was a VERY partial ocean view but we used the room for little else but sleeping and it was great. The rooms are very nice and newly decorated and the beds were very comfortable. We got a room with two beds so one could be our nap-after-the-beach-get sandy-bed and the other was our only to be slept in after showering bed. There can be street noise but with the patio door closed it's no problem. Other hotels are closer to the water, but most of these other places have outside bars and restaurants attached with loud music that goes until 1 or 2 am which has to be a problem when you just want to sleep. We were of the midset that we didn't want to spend an extra $100 bucks a day on a hotel when we could dedicate that towards having fun. This place was clean, quiet, practical, the fridge, microwave, and coffee maker were useful, and the staff were helpful and friendly. If you need to be catered to then go someplace more expensive but it's hawaii, why spend time indoors anyways?The free wireless internet worked well and it was handy to be able to map places ourselves. The beach is about 5 minutes away. All the buses you need to get anywhere stop right by the hotel. Starbucks is 1 block away.We rented a car but found easy street parking and saved ourselves $18 bucks a day.

<Content>Wow! We found this hotel while searching for a vacation package on another site. We were looking for something affordable, yet decent. I was a little nervous to see what the hotel would be like since it was such a great deal and the only thing we knew of it was that it was newly renovated. We were VERY pleased and surprised how such a great little hotel could be such a deal! It was conveniently located to EVERYTHING. The bus stop was across the street, a quaint little bakery right next door which was perfect for a quick breakfast, a lively bar featuring music, food , and pool tables also next door, the International Market place within steps of the hotel, and the beach within a few minutes of walking distance. The hotel was clean and the staff was extremely friendly. The rooms were also clean and cozy and most importantly...the A/C worked superbly (a must in my book for warm climates!). There is an activities desk in the lobby which was very convenient. Malia was super friendly and helpful in booking our excursions and the bellmen were all very kind. Especially Brian and Daryl... Mahalo to all of you for making our trip that much better. We will definitely be back!

<Content>I Highly Recommend The Aqua Wave My sister and I stayed at the Aqua Wave for six nigths. We found the room very spacious and the queen beds were very comfortable. We stayed on the 11th floor. It was just a short walk to the beach which was beautiful. The staff couldn't have been better. The front desk was very accommodating as well as every one else. We enjoyed the fresh coffee in the lobby every day. I would stay at The Wave again and recommend it to others. We ate at Dukes which was great and Jack in the Box directly across the street was very good for fast food.

<Content>Complete Review Hi, My family and I stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave from the 9th of May 2007 for 10 nights. Below I have posted a review in all areas I thought would be of interest to visitors.Location: The hotel is located right next to the International Market place. It is literally a 5-10 minute walk to Waikiki beach. Due to the location of the hotel, it does get quite noisy especially on Friday and Saturday nights, with music pumping well into the early hours of the moringing. This does get quite annoying, but is the whole city is busy so this hotel is not unique with noise. Reception: General Foyer area is OK. Nothing flash. There are toilets and phones located on the ground floor along with a concierge booking centre and 3 computers with internet access for $1 for 6 mins. The hotel has been refurbished. You can tell the hotel is ageing, but a good job has been done to refurbish and revitalise the foyer. The entrance to the hotel is accessible by having to walk up about 10 stairs. There is a lift the wheel chair access, but it was a bit of an inconvenience as we had 2 children and the use of a stroller was quite hard expecially with all the shopping / bag that we had. Rooms: Nicely renovated. We were in a partiual ocean view. To be honest, the view was crap. When the description is 'partial' it is very limited with how much ocean you actually see. It wasnt worth the extra cost for the ocean view. The balcony on the 11th floor did not lock, however when we requested a lock be placed on the door for the safety of the children, the maintenance man completed it straight away (very good). I would suggest that the hotel address this on all rooms and floors and parents need to know that the children cannot open the door themselves. The bathroom was clean with all amenties you would expect from 5 star hotels. The only thing I could say about it was that it is very very very small. Its alomost impossible giving 2 kids a bath without bumping into things.VERY COMFY BEDS.Pool: HAHAHA, dont waste your timeGym: DITTO . Breakfast (Aqua Start) This was a waste of time. Basically you get danish and juice from the restaurant next door or you can use the coupon to get $2 off any other menu item. Staff: Very nice. Always smiling, always willing to help. Would I stay there again? I would say no. Not because I didnt like the hotel , but because its the little things that you actually appreciate when on holidays.Eg: I didnt realise how much I missed laying in front of the pool, but the facilities at the hotel are like a old back yard swimming pool. The same goes for the gym. (But I understand the gym is being refurbished)It might sound pety to complaint about a hotel just because of the pool, but for me, going a holiday is about seeing the sights (including the beach) but also having the choice of just relaxing at the pool having a drink. Overall verdict: It is a very nice, clean hotel. Close to everything.Cheersbenjes (Aussie)

<Content>Another great visit... We stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave in Jan. 2007 as a family. When my husband and I went back in April, there was no question on where to stay while on Oahu.In Jan., we had a room on the backside of the building which was very noisy during the overnight hours. This time we had a room on the side. It was much quieter! One time we heard people being really loud from the street late at night, but other than that, it was much quieter!Thank you again, Aqua Waikiki Wave, for another wonderful stay! Other hotels need to purchase the beds you use because they are the best we've slept on in a hotel!!! Every night was a good night of sleep! We look forward to coming back.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay The hotel was in the process of being remodeled, but that was ok. It didn't have much impact on us. The front desk staff were really nice and very helpful. The housekeeping staff were great and very friendly. All employees went out of their way to get us what we wanted and needed, and always with a smile. The rooms were clean, and maintained well. The pool is very small and not in a great location, but hey, we were a short walk from the beach and there's way too much to do to be sitting by the pool. I think the exceptional service from the staff more than makes up for the small pool.

<Content>Pictures on website are better than the real thing First of all, let me start with the good things about the Aqua Waikiki Wave: - Great staff.- Courteous services.- Location excellent.- Free internet.And now the things that bothered us:- Room not as nice as the pictures on their website. Room and facilities are old, just a new paint job and new furniture  linens. Flat screen TV is nice but very small.- Our toilet didn't work. Bathroom was not clean.- Our room/lanai looked out to the garage (a very bad looking one at that). No Hawaii feel there! - Bed was not very comfortable - just basic.- Our toilet DIDN'T work!We were supposed to stay there for the entire week, but checked out after one day. The staff was very nice about everything. That's the biggest saving grace for the Waikiki Wave: the people who work there! We have nothing to complain about the services!

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at the Wave April 28 - May 12. It's an older renovated hotel. The room was great, good size, top floor and kept very clean. Everything new (except the air conditioning which was a bit noisy). Extremely comfortable bedding, flat screen TV, and good size fridge. It was nice to have the newspaper at your door every morning. The staff was absolutely the best we've ever seen. Really friendly and always accomodating. The hotel is close everything (but becasue of this, it's a bit noisy). Great value for the money. We will definitely stay there again.

Stayed from the 5th to the 13th of May in a party of 10,5 rooms in all and only 1 small problem of low water pressure in one room.The staff went above and beyond the call of duty,rooms were nice and the corner rooms even better.The aqua Wave is well placed and close to all things worth seeing and doing in Waikiki,yes a little noise but in the middle of down town just what you would expect.This was my 8th visit to Hawaii and the Aqua Wave was as good ,if not better than what we have stayed at before as we always look for value.Brian out the front is a real nice guy and can steer you to some of the best places to eat at .The service staff kept the rooms real nice and the tour desk operator went out of her way to help us.I could not think of any reason why I would not stay there again when we return next time.

Staff showed a genuine interest in that you were having a good time and enjoyed the sights that the island had to offer.

<Content>Don't take a room on Kuhio Avenue - you wont sleep I booked this hotel based on the reviews here. I rented an Aloha suite for 4 people and got a great rate. The room was in good shape even though the floor needed to be vacuumed. I was happy with the accommodation which included three beds, a fridge, a microwave and two TV's. I only wish there was a couch in the room. We also got free wireless access with the room. I was also pleased that the corner suite had two balconies - that was until about 2AM.We just rented for one night (Friday) as we were headed on a cruise the next day. I didn't think anything about our suite facing Kuhio Avenue until about 2AM - there are three nightclubs within walking distance to the hotel and people began spilling into the streets at that time. The yelling and screaming from the drunken masses continued until about 4:30 AM - I was surprised at how loud it was considering we were on the 12th floor of 14 in the building. We thought it was over, but at 5AM the beeping and booming sounds of the garbage trucks and street sweepers started. It all ended around 6 AM. And we hardly got any sleep. I would stay here again if I could be guaranteed a room that faced away from the street.

<Content>Great time at Wave I had a great tme at the Waikiki Wave. Called direct to hotel and got a $125 rate. I also got an upgrade to a deluxe room. Rooms were clean and beds were comfy. Best thing about this hotel is the staff. Friendliest folks I've seen at a hotel, they really are proud of what they do.

<Content>fair deal We stayed there for 6 nights. The condition is okay for the price we paid (it is hawaii). It is clean and good location. The problem is the parking and noise at night. We stayed at 4th floor and near the international market side. The noise is from there. Better to ask for a higher floor and that may give you a better view and reduced noise. The paking space is tight, once we had to get out the car (a van) from the back door since no room to open the side doors.If you go a long way to there, it is worthy to spend more and stay in a nicer hotel. If you have tight buget, it is okay to stay here.

<Content>No 1970s in Waikiki - an excellent pick! This hotel has been recently renovated - rooms are lovely (clean too) and the location is excellent, with everything walking distance (or stumbling distance). If you've been to waikiki before you'd be aware many hotels are very reminisant of the 70s/80s in decor, so it was quite a find to stay somewhere from the 2000s. We had quite the adventure when we stayed here as one of our travelling companions developed appendicitus and had to be hospitalised for a week, so our stay was a little longer than planned. The staff were very helpful and friendly, even knowing us by name at the end of the trip ;-)As a side note it is worth trying to stay a little higher up or on the non-street side of the building as it can get slighty noisy with a few nite clubs near by.

<Content>Short but lovely stay here Unfortunately, we only had 2 seperate one night stays at the Aqua Waikiki Wave, that was before and after a cruise around the islands. We settled really quickly, everything was good and we could have happily had a week post cruise if work/holidays would have allowed! It was our first visit to Hawaii and a very good one. If we do get chance to return I would love to book the Aqua Wave again.Check in was good from flight, also when we came from the cruise it was only 10.30a.m.  obviously our room would not be ready, so the porter tagged our bags and locked them away so that we could go to the beach(only 5 mins walk away) and explore we had a lot to do in 1 day!! We came back early afternoon and they found us a room that was ready, although we were officially an hour before check in time still.We had breakfast next door which Continental Breakfast was free (voucher from Hotel) we upgraded to a cooked breakfast and paid the extra, that was good.S  G Davies from England.

(2 blocks to beach) Rooms were clean, spacious, and all amneties were in the room that was advertised. Service was excellent. Front desk personel were always helpfull. Parking was the only drawback. Would stay again.

<Content>Really enjoyed our stay I and my family stayed at the Waikiki Wave the first week of April 2007 and really enjoyed our stay. The staff was professional and courteous, the proximity to the beach was really nice, without the outlandish prices of the beach front hotels, and the rooms were clean, roomy and comfortable. Furthermore, the international market is literally right at the base of the hotel towards the beach making for very convenient shopping and picking up a bite to eat.Mind you, these are not the lavish rooms of a high end resort. But if you are looking for economical lodging for a budget conscious trip (if one can call anything in Waikiki economical) this is a solid suggestion. Be aware parking is a nightmare and costly. But otherwise our experience was such we would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Absolutely great value hotel, failry hip and modern for a budget boutique Being an ex travel agent ,seeing the quality of hotels on line always worries me since I know the best rooms are always pictured but not always what you get.. We initially wanted to book the new sister hotel Coconut Plaza as we know the standard and have stayed before but that hotel was sold out. I found this one on line and was very surprised at how close the pictures are to the actual rooms. The rooms have been redone from the old hotel Coral reef and are fairly hip and modern in color and furniture (think Miami beach boutique hotel) The double queen room we had was on the 15th floor and directly across the elevator. We were worried we would hear noise from the other people getting off and on the elevator but did not hear a peep. The room had a free safe, microwave, coffeemaker, iron/board, hairdryer which we all used. Beds were great with nice comforters, flat screen was fine albeit a bit hard to initially use, free wireless , and the lanai had a nice partial ocean. Drawbacks: we had our 2 year old and were afraid to have her on the balcony since she could fit between the slats. Pool next to garage was small (think jacuzzi size) and very dated but then again they don't advertise the pool. No stairs from street to lobby but there is a nice bellhop if needed. Front desk staff very nice (kept having to use their scissors!). Concierege, activity desk nice but when trying to book a last minute luau, gave a price that was way more than the online or phone sales info. In the end we didn't book as we knew we could book direct with the luau place. Location nice behnd the International Marketplace and only 5 minute walk to beach. We walked an extra 5 minutes to get to the protected beach for our 2 year old.Overall, the hotel is a great value for the money, and we have a new favorite hotel in Waikiki that we would definitley stay at again We got the AAA room rate for about $110 per night.

We loved this hotel, convenient to everything, the beach is just around the corner, restaurants are all ove the place, the international market is next door, staff were all very friendly and helpful, we truly loved our room, reminded us of our stay in Japan with the tatami door,the only bad thing about this hotel is the parking $$ and hardly any parking space for the hotel guests but over all, I will definetely stay here again the next time we visit Oahu.

<Content>Big Improvement I am currently staying at the Aqua Waikiki Wave. I stayed here 5 years ago when it was the Aston Coral Reef. They have done a really nice job on renovating the hotel. Not much structurally but a bunch cosmetically. Rooms are clean and fresh. Good beds and nice furniture. I had heard complaints about the water pressure in the showers. Pressure is completely adjustable. It can be as soft as a gentle rain or very forceful. Water always hot.The staff is very friendly and helpful. Fresh apples on the check-in desk at all times. Towels can be checked out for the beach which is just a couple of blocks away.Good food located close to the hotel. The Galaxy up the street has $329 breakfasts that are as good if not better than Denny's at half the price.I have stayed here again and I will stay here again.

<Content>Great Stay Enjoyed our stay with very few surprises thanks to all the Trip Advisor reviews posted. Arrived early afternoon and went directly to the hotel hoping for early check-in. Hotel signage was hard to spot, street in front of hotel had a small unloading area, so we turned down the side alley and parked underneath the hotel. We were able to check-in early, given 4th floor room facing parkade. Rooms were of adequate size, clean, beds were very comfortable. Rooms come with fridge/freezer,LCD TV, DVD player, microwave, hair blowdryer, coffee maker. Ice was available at the front desk, newspapers delivered to your door every morning. While we were there, they were painting the inside and exterior of the building, keeping everything looking fresh. After the first night, my wife asked the front desk to move us as the parkade creates a lot of noise- car hoist, cars lining up to park, people waiting for their cars. Without hesitation, they moved us to the 11th floor when a room became available - room was virtually the same except the view was of Waikiki downtown, and we were distant from the noise. The small pool is accessed by walking through the parkade to the back of the hotel, it is surrounded by solid fencing, has 8 lounge chairs, we didn't use it , beach was a better setting. Parking is $18 per day, underground holds only about 20 cars, the parking garage next door takes the hotel overflow. They have a business office, Internet available for a fee, and they also have at certain hours an activity desk to book your sightseeing trips or activities. This hotel is situated in a busy area, 2 clubs close by, the volume of people seemed to increased between Thursday and Saturday. Streetwalkers do walk Kuhio at night, along with touists and groups of people outside of the clubs, but we never felt threatened at all walking around at night. The hotel locks the doors at 10:00pm and you have to use your room key to enter the hotel. There is usually a doorman at front during the day and early evening, and a securtiy person during the late night. Hotel has a Chinese Restaurant inside, Da Big Kahuna Restaurant out front, St Germaines Bakery next door, and tons of other restaurants around - you name it, LL for plate lunches, Starbucks, Cheesecake Factory, California Pizza Kitchen, Sushi, Chili's, fast food, ramen houses, etc. For shopping, ABC stores (they're almost on every block)for snacks, drinks, sun tan lotion, beach mats, boogie boards, mac nuts, t-shirts, etc. There's a Food Pantry 1 1/2 blocks away for groceries and DVD rentals. The International MarketPlace for souveniers, and on the west side of the hotel, there are vendors with booths similar to the Int'l Marketplace. Behind the hotel on Kalakaua Avenue you'll find the higher end stores lining the street like Macy's, Coach, Nine West, etc. My wife found the jewellery stores, all of them.Closest beach access was 1 1/2 blocks away beside the Cheescake Factory on Kalakaua. Getting around on The Bus is $2 a trip, or you can purchase an unlimited 4 day pass at the ABC stores for $20. The maid service was very good, clean sheets and towels (they do not have a save the towel program) everyday, but the service and attitude from the front desk  doormen was the best. Always helpful and with a smile. We would not hesitate to return to this hotel.

<Content>We found the rooml delightful and the staff very helpful. We spent our 49th wedding anniversary at the hotel and were very pleased with the room. The newly redecorated rooms were very pleasant and the bed was really comfortable and had a real cotton blanket, not one manufactured from recycled plastic. We enjoyed the view of Diamond Head and the ocean from the 14th(actually the 13th) floor. We like 13 as that was our address for 8 years and now part of our email address. We will recommend the hotel to our friends visiting Waikiki.

<Content>Over-promise, Under-deliver This boutique chain has an attractive marketing campaign--their 7 pillars. They may deliver at their other properties, but at the Aqua Wave, it's hit and miss. The room I had was nicely renovated. The lobby felt like a bland bus terminal. I saw no fitness center (there's a small room with mats and a treadmill). If there were spa facilities or continental breakfast, I didn't see them. WiFi in my room unreliable, often not working at all. Housekeeping inconsistent. Front desk staff tried to be helpful, but seemed very stressed. Aqua may need more time to pull this together, but I get tired of all the shiney promies from hotels and airlines.

<Content>Very Central - value for your money This hotel is centrally located and we found it very convient for our first trip to Oahu. The room had a balcony and 2 Double Beds and bathroom with LCD Tv and fridge  microwave. The staff at the reception are friendly and informative. And special thanks to our room maid on Level 2 our room was spotless everyday (clean sheets  towels daily). Our package included complimentary breakfast, which was served next door at the Big Kahuna restaurant (variety of continential cakes  pastries was served daily) .. fantastic. Public transport was conviently located and the same with Take away food and restaurants near by.... try a nice Buffet at Smorgy and Thai food at Keoni (opposite each other). There are a few popular Night clubs near this hotel, so you will hear a bit of roudy crowds during the night but feel safe as this hotel has a security guard and if you go for a stroll in the evening you are close to your hotel. Our bedroom view was not much to talk about (car parking building) however we were on the go early each morning and back late at night it didn't bother us on this trip. But for a few dollars extra a night you might want to request ocean views. We plan to stay at this hotel on our next trip to Oahu.

<Content>Good Hotel for the Price We stayed at the Wave 2/9 for three nights (Pro Bowl week) and paid 154.00 per night which included all taxes and fees. I found the reviews to be very accurate, especially the comment about the rooms being 鈥渟urface鈥?renovated. There was new paint and furnishing, but bathroom had original fixtures and tile. If you looked close, the workmanship was a little sloppy, but if it鈥檚 not your house, who cares about perfection. The overall room appearance was very nice.The hotel is centrally located in Waikiki, thus there is a noise issue. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to think about a different hotel/location. If you prefer a view, make sure to ask for a room up high. We had room 519 and it had a view of the parking garage across the alley. We didn鈥檛 bother to ask for a different room, because we didn鈥檛 care. The hotel staff was excellent. They allowed us to check in early and satisfied our every request during our stay. The hotel offers the following:-complimentary coffee kit in your room each day-internet/fax/copier for fee (I believe internet was 20 cents/minute w/minimum of $5.00)-internet 鈥?complimentary wi-fi (cable connection also available)-complimentary local newspaper-$18.00 parking fee-complimentary safe-complimentary local  toll-free phone calls-refrigerator (nice size)-microwave-flat screen TV with good selection of channels

<Content>Not bad for the price We were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The location is excellent. It is in the middle of Waikiki, right next to the International market. It is two blocks from the beach. The room was clean (703). You could tell that the hotel was recently renovated. There was new paint, artwork, flooring. We checked out towels from the front desk daily to go to the beach. There is a complementary coffee machine (regular and decaf) in the lobby. The decaf usually didn't work. 7-11 and a bakery are next door with Jack in the Box being across the street. Our balcony faced west, so we were able to sunbathe in the afternoon. The website said something about going away cookies, but the staff weren't aware of this. Location is safe. Would stay there again. 3 people for $114/night. Beds and pillows were comfortable.

<Content>Nice Hotel With only 3 nights and 4 days to enjoy Oahu, we didn't want to spend too much money, so we took a chance on a less than 5 star hotel. We were not disappointed! No scenic views, but we expected that. We still enjoyed the balcony. The room was decorated very fashionably. The bed was clean, comfy and double-sheeted w/o an unsanitary comfortor or bed spread. Bathroom was nice and clean, w/a hairdryer. We enjoyed coffee in the room daily (absolute necessity) and purchased add'l ground coffee from the ABC store next door. Maid service was terrific. We easily obtained beach towels from the desk. We obtained useful info from the staff at the desk. The hotel is close to the beach and we took a $2 /ea. bus ride to Diamond Head. The only minor problem was really loud noises coming from the parking garage outside our balcony at 3am on Sunday. We should have called the desk, as they assured us that they would have called security and stopped whatever was going on. We rode it out with pillows over our heads and did get back to sleep! Our mistake! Sun. and Mon. nights were very peaceful. We would return to this hotel....especially for the deal we got through Pleasant Holidays. Debbie, Madera, CA

<Content>Great Place 4 a Great Price! I had read a few reviews about The Aqua Waikiki Wave complaining about the noise, the elevators,  the bathrooms. Well, you know what? Those people were correct but honestly, I got over all of that pretty quick. The hotel and its staff are WONDERFUL!!!!! My friend and I just got back on 3/14 and our stay was great! The hotel was a little difficult to find but we were looking for it at night. The outside is very non-discreet and could use some re-furbishments. The inside could use some work as well. However, the rooms are all done very nicely, very modern. My friend and I lucked out. We were given a corner room that was probably 1 1/2-2 times the size of a normal room. The bath room was quite small and needed some work but everything functioned. The elevators were alright. I've stayed at hotels where the elevators were MUCH slower. Unfortunately, one of the two elevators broke down while we were there and it was possibly at the worst time: the weekend. But it did get fixed come Monday and everything seemed fine. It could have been better if the pool were accessible from the hotel, instead of having to walk outside and around the hotel to get to the pool. But the beach is 2 blocks away. Why go to the pool? The hotel is, literally, right next to the International Market Place. Walk out the lobby doors, make 2 lefts. and you are at one end of the Marketplace. The staff were very friendly and eager to help give directions or whatever. The parking was a little difficult to find at first and it was first come, first serve in the hotel's parking garage. However, you could also park next door at the other garage so we never had issues with parking. Our room was on the 4th floor, facing Kuhio Ave so we got some of the noise at night. It seemed to bother my friend a bit but I slept through most of it. All in all, the hotel was great and I would definitely stay at the Aqua Waikiki Wave again.

<Content>Great value, and no compromises on cleanliness and modern feel. We stayed here March 4th 2007 for one night at $114 and were very satisfied. The rest of our trip we were staying at a $300 a night hotel, so we chose to stay our first night in an inexpensive hotel to save some money. The room was clean and recently renovated. I didn't feel like I was staying in an old and dingy room (which was what I expected for the price). I have stayed at hotels in Hawaii for this price, but it usually feels dated or worn. Not the Aqua Waikiki Wave. Aqua Waikiki Wave felt modern and clean.The water pressure in the shower was more than adequate, maid service was good, and we did not have to wait long for the elevators. The pool is not worth going to. But if you're just looking for a place to sleep, it doesn't really matter anyway. The continental breakfast is not worth it (mediocre coffee and Danish). But you can go across the street to Seaside Bar and Grill for a cheap breakfast.If you don't want to pay $18 a night to self park, there is Ameripark garage right next door (in the alley) for $10 a night. If you want to go in and out (in one day) of Ameripark, you pay a different rate. It is a mulit-level automatic garage with one or two attendants.So if you're looking for a nice place to stay on a budget and don't plan to hang around your hotel too much, this is a good place to stay. If you want to hang out at a pool and the hotel scene, then I would look elsewhere.

<Content>lovely place We used to stay there for a long time. The ratio price/quality is excellent. It is near from the beache and the bus station. The room is large with 2 queen beds and clean. The room is equipped with microwave , refrigerator and coffee maker. We were pleased to stay there. I have particularly appreciate the dvd reader, so I was able to make my excercise every day. However, this hotel have an excercise room for the guests. The staffs are very kind and very good. They do their best to make you happy. I recommend a room from level 9 to have a nice view and it is more quiet during the night especially. The pool is correct but small. This hotel was recently renovated with a japanese style and other renovations will be done during the present year to organize a spa and a meeting room.

<Content>Good Value! Just got back! We stayed at the Wave for 8 days (with my husband and our child) and had a room on the 12th floor with 2 queen beds. Awesome view of the water and the mountains and the golf course too! The beds were very comfortable. We contacted the hotel directly and paid $114 US a night. The bathroom is a bit small, but water pressure was great and never ran out of hot water, concidering our kid loves to take LONG showers! WARNING: If you are a light sleeper take earplugs. Another reviewer suggested that and I sure am glad I did! The other 2 in my family were asleep before their heads hit the pillows, but I am a really light sleeper and without the earplugs I think I would have been irritated. I found the hotel staff good....but not great...except for Frank...he was very helpful. I tipped the cleaning lady every other day.....and they always said thanks very much! ($5 each time) We used the FREE concierge service to book adventures and I have to say Bree-Ann is a wonderful, enthusiastic person! Great help! Sure you have to pay for internet service ($1 for 6 minutes) but geez, it's not much! They have a basket with free apples at the front desk and we took one every day to have with our danish/juice continental. And if I didn't eat it at breakfast it came in handy later when you need a quick fix! Thanks Wave! We ate at Fatty's and Mooses among other places. I found Mooses' portion sizes so generous that I always had left-overs for breakfast the next day. And believe it or not I had THE BEST rib-eye steak there!! They also have half price drinks from 4-8 and boy can they mix a long island tea but good! !I found the hotel room fridge excellent for it's size. I had no problem putting 3 water bottles in the freezer every night for the next day. I wish I had thought to bring my freezer gels and a small cloth cooler from home! That would of been great for our beach days. Listen there is NO shade at the beach so buy an umbrella and bring it. We bought one there for $10 at Walmart and had no trouble checking it at the airport to bring home. Watch how the regulars rig the umbrella so it doesn't fly away in the wind....we did it too and it works like a charm! All in all a very positive experience for $114 a night. Only negative is the noise, but that is NOT their fault. If you stay right in the heart of a very busy tourist place you have to expect noise!I do want to say one last thing: I found the majority of the people who are venders in the International Market to be pleasant at best. It was very apparent that they actually resent tourists. Ironic I know, but true. I actually had one woman say Why you look so long? Just hurry up and pick a color! So I did hurry up...right over to the next vender and bought the 8 necklaces there instead! I am a firm negotiator too! I had the OPPOSITE experience at Macy's, and in fact found that I spent much more money than I planned to there! Very nice sales ladies at Macy's! Aloha!

<Content>Great trip! We recently stayed at the AQUA Waikiki Wave and had a wonderful experience! The hotel is centrally located next to any wants or needs you could possibly have! Convenience stores, ABC stores, shopping, fast food, local and national restaurant chains, church services, bus stops and the beautiful Pacific ocean and beach are all within minutes from the Wave. We walked or rode a trolley or bus everywhere. (Trolley rides took more wait time than we would have liked) The hotel is clean and housekeeping is very attentive. Our room on the 15th floor had a partial ocean view and balcony (lanai) that was just great. It had 2 large queen beds and the room was spacious. Our rates for February 24-March 3 was $155 per night. There is a helpful Expedia representative in the lobby to help you with any tours or needed travel plans. An internet center is available in the lobby for a $5 minimum charge. Elevators and water pressure/temperature were no problems. The pool left alot to be desired but who goes to a pool with the Pacific ocean so close! Overall our trip was a beautiful anniversary experience to an island paradise!

<Content>Loved it! Awesomliscious!! Was at the Wave several years ago when it was the Coral Reef and WOW!, what a change they have made! The whole place has been renovated to feel like a cool metropolitan hotel. The rooms have warm red walls, polished brass hardware, soft and cushy carpet, on and on! The one thing that has not changed are the views of Diamond Head and the Ocean from the higher floors (note to self)!Not only did we love the new renovation but the location is great too. 2 blocks to the beach, 1 block to Tiffany's and Prada, and 3 Starbucks' within 3 blocks! I forgot to mention, free beach towels were given to us by the front desk when they saw we had our beach gear in tow!Then there is the staff that is sooo great!! What service for such a good value hotel. The bellman and housekeepers remembered our names and everytime someone saw us, they asked is there anything we can do to make your stay better?! Wow! Waikiki Wave, you have won our hearts!! Sincerely, Mr. Ride Da Wave!

<Content>Fantastic Service, Staff and Room What a super guest experience. From our check in, our fantastic house keeper, Uma, to the spacious, clean room on the 11th floor, this Hotel stay was a delight.I understand the lobby area/fitness rom is going to be up dated, but I don't spend any time there anyway. The beds were comfortable, room always cleaned to perfection, coffee and newspaper provided to start that day off on our balcony, enjoying the ocean view.As a senior, I was given a more than fair rate for our room. I can't say enough good things about my Aqua Waikiki Wave stay,other than, I'll be back!

<Content>Decent hotel for the price The Wave was exactly as we expected for the price! The rooms were nice and the beds and pillows super comfy! Sure the tiling in the bathroom was old and toilet had seen better days but they were both functional. I would recommend paying the extra and getting a deluxe room (floors 8-12) as it can be quite noisy - especially at weekends. One side of the hotel looks over a noisy, rusty garage and the other side over temporary stalls for the International Market Place. I asked about upgrading to a room with 3 queen beds and they offered it to me for a bargain $20 extra a night. I didn't take them up on their offer in the end because we would have had to change rooms and I couldn't be bothered to pack up again.The hotel was further from the beach than I thought and with two young kids and a disabled mum riding a scooter it was too far for us. The pool is very small but my kids absolutely loved playing in it. Not a particularly nice setting either but it did the job of keeping my kids happy.Plenty of shops close by including fast food, bakery, 7-11 etc.The staff were very nice and accommodating. They give you beach towels if required.The parking was always busy and cost $18 per night. Why pay this when around the corner on Seaside Avenue you could park at Hawaiin Cirque for $6 per night?For the money the Wave was good but I would definitely stay somewherecloser to the beach next time with a bigger pool.

<Content>Not what we expected I do not blame the hotel for our disappointment. In fact the staff was great and atleast attempted to help. We did the dumb thing and let a travel agent handle our honeymoon. She promised us a large room with balcony and nice view of either the city or ocean. We were told since we were honeymooning that we would get a free upgraded room. We ended up with a not so small room, but there were two queen sized beds. Maybe ok for a large family on a budget but not exactly to appealing for a honeymoon couple. The beautiful view from the balcony, was a dark parking garage. The bathroom was rather small, and the water pressure in the shower wasnt exactly great. I hate complaining but I figured since we're on a honeymoon, I'd atleast attempt to get a better room with only one bed. As I said the staff was nice, and he apologized but he informed us that they were unable to upgrade our room as promised by agent, unless of course we forked out more money. He did move us to another room. However again there were two beds, and even worse water pressure. The rooms were clean but rather dim and rustic looking due to decor and carpet. Our sheets were changed only the 2nd day of our stay. After a few days I asked a maid for fresh sheets and after she handed them to me, she mumbled to a co worker that a tip goes a long ways. I guess the $3 tip we left each morning wasnt enough to even get a change of sheets.The free breakfast consisted of a danish roll and a cup of coffee (No, Im not kidding) The location of the small pool creeped us out. But overall we were close to the beach and some good resturaunts. The noise wasnt as bad as it could have been. There was a nice tv in room and the beds were comfortable. And for the 3rd time, the staff was easy going and nice, but just couldnt do any of the things our travel agent promised us. Unless we were on a serious budget, I wouldnt stay there again. And if any of you are planning a honeymoon in Hawaii, stay elsewhere!!!

<Content>Loved the Hotel and Location I stayed at the AQUA Waikiki Wave February 7 - 14, 2007 for the ProBowl game. The newly renovated hotel was just what I needed for my trip. Rooms were clean and modern. I had a mini-fridge, micro, coffee maker, flat screen, safe as just some of the amenities. I loved the location of the hotel as it was centrally located to all my needs. The hotel is located near the International Market and just a block off the beach. Adjacent to the hotel is a great restaurant for a sit down meal (Big Kuhunas), Starbucks, Jamba Juice, Jack in the Box, and an ABC store (for all needs). The staff was great. Very friendly and quick to make any of your needs happen! If I had to pull a few negatives out it would be the water in my bath most of the time was not hot. Eventually, it would get hot but I couldnt count on just jumping in the shower when I wanted. If you want a pool to swim in - this hotel does not have the pool for you. Bad location (enter through the garage) and very, very small. Hit the beach instead as it is only 5 minutes away. I had a great vacation and when I come back, I will stay at this hotel again!

<Content>Service was great The hotel itself was nothing special but the service was great. We stayed there for a week and everyone we spoke to was more than helpful. The rooms are neat and clean and have nice conveniences like a fridge and microwave. We tried a couple rooms and neither had a great view of either the beach or mountain so we had to primarily look over a parking garage. The elevators were being fixed during our stay which lead to sometimes rather long delays. The beach is only a block away and it's location is close to everything on the Waikiki strip. Finding parking was almost impossible but there's a parking garage next door that's cheaper and always available.I'd say the hotel itself was about a 2 1/2 star hotel but with 4 star service. Considering the cost, I think the Waikiki Wave was a good deal.

<Content>Decent Hotel, Good Location, Good price Stayed for two nights at this hotel on a layover. It is clean and comfortable, recently refurbished and in a great location. It is in a very busy area so there is a lot of noise but we were on the 8th floor so it was fine for sleeping. The pool is a tiny little thing in the back alley behind the dumpster but who would use it anyway. The worst part was trying to stop to drop your luggage. The hotel sign is hard to find and there was no where to stop in front of it. There was no parking at the hotel and had to park in the conference center parking and drag our luggage down the busy street.

<Content>Relaxing  Although I have vacationed in Waikiki several times staying at some of the well renowned lodging sites such as the military's finest Hale Koa and the Hyatt Regency before my stay at Aqua Wave, I must admit, I was most impressed with the Aqua Wave... At the Aqua Wave, from the Security/Greeter, to the front desk personnel, and house keeping alike, my husband and I were treated with the highest hospitality... since we were staying there for our honeymoon, we received a free upgrade room. Our room had two balconies, was enormous in size, and well organized and thoughtout with Comfort in mind....... I like to snack throughout the day and sometimes night, so the mini kitchenette was one of the delightful amenities we searched for. I am very impressed with the quality of this hotel for its rates, and I will definitely stay at the Aqua Wave the next time I am in Waikiki. Oh yes, and just in case you are looking for the best of the best Spa/Massage Treatments, look no further because the front desk attendants can help you with arranging Spa time with that special someone... My husband and I did the couples treatment at the sister hotel the luxuries Bamboo hotel. it was relaxing and refreshing...........consider staying at the Waikiki Wave if ever in Hawaii............

<Content>Okay for the money We stayed one night prior to a cruise and paid about $135 which is a good price for Wakiki. The room was clean and renovated but the bathroom was still original fixtures, tiles, etc. It seemed 'surface renovated', not fully redone. It overlooked a noisy parking garage despite being a 'superior view' room. But the hotel location was ideal for seeing all that Wakiki had to offer. The walk to the beach was 5 minutes. We have never seen a smaller pool but it was clean. Guess space is really at a premium in Hawaii!We had continental breakfast included and we had to go to an adjacent restaurant which was fine. However, don't plan your visit around the a free hearty breakfast as it was a packaged danish and coffee. The staff was most helpful and kept our luggage for us after we had checked out. They were wonderful actually.Overall, it was a fine, stopover type hotel but we wouldn't want to spend a week here.

<Content>Great Place to Stay Aqua Waikiki Wave...2/7/07-2/9/07. We enjoyed a wonderful experience! We found the staff to very helpful and friendly. The rooms were quiet spaceous. For the business traveler complimentary wirless access in each room (wow). The rooms were newly renovated. It was great having an area to work in, as well as the benefit great sleeping quarters. Some of the amenities in the room included new appliances, i.e., medium size refridgerator, a microwave oven and even a flat screen television. The hotel is located within walking distance (10 minutes or less) to some great night spots, i.e. Duke's on the Beach, Cheese Cake Factory and the Beach at Waikiki. We found the accomodations a great deal considering the location and the amenities of a Great Boutique Hotel. You will find delight in the treasure in the center of down town Waikiki.

<Content>Good for the price Put right in the heart of Waikiki, at first glance, you might get a little nervous...after passing through the lobby and being greeted by the friendliest of workers, it becomes a hotel that you want to stay in. The rooms are spacious with balconies and a flat screen tv. The beds are also very comfortable. Housekeeping is there in minutes to bring you anything that you call for. However, dont expect to sit by the pool and sip pina coladas. You have to get to the pool through the parking garage and its not an atmosphere you want to relax in. Head for the beach instead, only a short 5 minute walk to the closet beach. If you're looking for a romantic getaway, this might not be the place. Its located right on a main road which is a little noisy and crowded. For a friends getaway, its a good locaton close to restaurants and clubs.

<Content>Hulagirl I just returned from a wonderful stay at the Waikiki Wave during Pro Bowl Feb 9 鈥?12, 2007; I had corner room(1114) with two balconies, the room was spacious, very clean, comfortable beds, microwave (great for reheating leftovers), coffee maker, and refrigerator. I have stayed in Waikiki many times, but always at deluxe ocean front properties. I found the hotel was in a good location, close to the beach (5 minute walk), just behind the International Market place, very close to shopping, restaurants, etc.I must admit I was a little worried because of what I read on this site, but I am had a fantastic time and I felt the feeling of Aloha at The Waikiki Wave

<Content>Had a wonderful weekend vacation! Just got back from a wonderful vacation in Waikiki during Pro Bowl Weekend! Boy was Waikiki booming with lots of people for the football game. Waikiki Wave was perfect for us because of location and quality - easy to get around and our room was remarkably clean. Infact, you see the housekeeping guy in the lobby always cleaning and it was nice to see some kind of supervisor walking around in the lobby and on my floor making sure things were in order. Really liked grabbing a cup of coffee off the elevator before going out for the day. By the way, the staff is really friendly, we felt so welcome here. You would think you were in a small friendly town instead of a major city in Hawaii.Parking is challenging, but doable. Oh yeah, tidbit...Found a cute little karaoke place at Miramar Hotel, the host is really friendly and entertaining if your like singing!I would definitely stay at Waikiki Wave again!

<Content>Paradise Home We spent twenty-seven nights (Jan 9th to Feb 7th) in the Waikiki Wave Hotel and it was our Paradise away from Home! This is our tenth year at this hotel and their remodeling efforts have really improved the comfort and appearance within the Waikiki Wave. The staff continues to be very hospitable and caring -- how can I help you? -- remember your towels for the beach --- where will you eat today? Located beside the International Market Place and just a short walk from Waikiki Beach -- all this combines to make for a wonderful vacation -- we recommend the Waikiki Wave Hotel. ALOHA! - from Northwest Iowa!

<Content>Really good Everything during my stay was really good. I could easily walk to the beach everyday. The property is only a block away from the Royal Hawaiian beach so all those poeple who pay $300 a night swim at the same beach as me and I only paid $125 per night. My room was big and comfy and very clean.It looks like they are finishing up the renovation and the manager told me they will soon have a new gym and breakfast room. It was a little noisy in the morning but overall for the price it was the best place I have stayed in Waikiki.

<Content>Despite some reviews - this hotel was awesome! First off - I went to tripadvisor.com to see what hotels I wanted to stay in. I then looked at websites for some good deals. I found Waikiki Wave. The reviews where so so and I was a bit worried but it ended up being one of the nicest hotels in waikiki! I told a better deal on another website and noticed that the property will match anyone else's rate. I gave them a call and they gave me the same rate and offers. This allowed me to not have to pay in full like the other website! When we arrived the hotel entrance was very appealing. I stayed on the 8th floor and they rooms looked just like the photos on their website. The bathroom was nice with the marble counters and amenties! The water pressure was great dispite another reviews. I was traveling with family and they also stayed on the 3rd floor. Concerning the noise - its a CITY, you're not going to have absolute quiet as if you where staying in the country! I'm thinking the people who where complaining of the noise must have had a hangover since the noise wasn't that loud. Even when I was on the terrace (which are in every room!) it was peace and not thay loud. You would get the occasionally yell from the street but that was it. People in Hawaii don't honk their horns as often as other states! The staff was very friendly even dealing with a couple of my family members that can be very demanding and loud (then being from NYC). When I ask for something to be sent to my room, it was promply delivered! The Bellboy was nice as well and very happy for a tip for our luggage. He acted as though it was his job to help us with our luggage rather then it was our duty to give him a tip for carrying our luggage. They also have a concierge desk which was helpful and it was either the same price as what you would pay for your own for your daily excusion or cheaper! The beach was only a 3 minute walk and EVERYTHING you needed was in walking distance. Overall this hotel is great and a bargin because of location,service and the room. If I would compare this hotel to a popular chain, it would be the Marriott. I would come back time and time again!!!

<Content>Worth a look We stayed at the Waikiki Wave from Jan 11-Jan 18. They fixed the water pressure while we were there. It is now quite the shower! The first few days it wasn't very good, but it wasn't unbearable. By the last few days, there was plenty of pressure. We had no clogs, either. The beds do not have a warm cover - just a few sheets with a thin blanket between. If you adjust your a/c  open your balcony door, you probably don't need a heavy bedspread - and the sheets are most likely cleaned more often than a bedspread would be!They were cleaning almost all the time. The front lobby was very clean  our rooms were cleaned well each night. We did tip the housekeeping staff every morning and also wrote a note regarding what we needed in our room like extra towels, coffee, etc. - that may help. Our sheets seemed to be changed enough - I don't change my sheets at home nightly, so if they went 2 days in between it was OK with me. The staff was generally nice and helpful - we do have a problem with our charges, though, as we were charged for parking every day  only used the parking garage 2 days. It is $15/day to park, however this is very standard at ANY hotel you choose to stay at in Waikiki. There aren't very many parking spaces - there are more than 10, though, and we found a spot to park easily both nights we had a car. The hotel was a trick to find! watch for the Big Kahuna restaurant, or the Saint Germains bakery which are very close by. We drove past it 3 times before figuring out that you turned in directly beside the hotel and drive down an alley to park.

<Author>SaskatchewanCanada
<Content>okay for price Hello from Canada! I love the Trip Advisor Review Site and find it very beneficial when booking a hotel. Traveler鈥檚 comments have helped us many times when deciding to stay at a hotel. So here are my experiences and I hope it helps you when you book your stay in fantastic Waikiki!!We stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave from Dec 24/06-Jan 7/07. We stayed at the hotel when it was called the Aston Coral Reef about 5 years ago and it was nasty. Big improvement since then. Although, I found it was a quick fix renovation. My question is why would you spend 7.5 million on a renovation and not upgrade the shower/bath system?!? The shower SUCKED! You couldn't even get the sand off your body. You got more pressure from the tap in the sink!! Our toilet also got plugged but the maintenance man was fairly quick to repair it. The hotel carpet looks like it was a cheap quality as it was already worn and torn in the elevator. I realize that this is a highly used area, however the reno's were just done in October and it's only January. Can't imagine what they will look like in a year or more!Don't be fooled by the photos on their website (no flowers or silk plants). Nor do the beds have the nice white cover that they show on their website. It's just a white sheet (which is fine by me as I assume they wash them along with the rest of the bedding?!?). Speaking of washing, during our 2 week stay our sheets were only changed twice. Sometimes the maids didn't leave us any towels so we had to call down for them, but they were prompt. For the most part, the maids were pretty efficient and nothing was stolen like other hotel quests. As per other readers comments regarding noise, you're going to get noise anywhere in Waikiki. It's a hoppin' city!! Don't let that discourage you. You are definitely wise to stay on the east side of the hotel as the parking lot on the west side isn't the most beautiful view! We asked to be moved because of that reason along with the fact that we had mold on our tiles in the shower. Something you don't expect after reading a relaxing place of escape that is cleverly hip on their website. Mold is not cleverly hip in any shower folks!! Another frustration that we had (especially myself as I am a contact lense wearer) is the fact that all the towels were brand new and you ended up being covered from head to toe with lint. Even the beach towels (which are nice and big) were lint distributors. So maybe by the time you visit they will all be broken in and lint free! You could not get any radio stations on the clock radio provided, so if you like music or like to be woken to music, bring your own!The front desk staff were okay. I found Trevor to be the nicest. The rest just seemed like you were an interruption to their day. Some days they had candles burning in the lobby which was a very nice touch (and aroma) and sometimes they had apples in a basket which was also a nice touch.When checking in we never received our coupon book, continental breakfast coupons or free beach bag coupon. When we asked for them it was no problem. The continental breakfast (which was posted on the website as delivered to your room daily when we booked our stay) was not the case (I see they've changed that now). You had to go to the Big Kahuna outside of the hotel and it was a joke. The danish was the size of a cracker and the coffee was a small cup - no refills. We used it one day and never went back. If you want a great breakfast go the Shorbird Restaurant in the Outrigger Reef on the Beach Hotel - fantastic!!!Overall, for the money (we paid $128 a night) for a Superior Wave room, the hotel is okay. The best part of the hotel is the location as you are close to everything. For the most part you are not in your room, so it is an affordable, clean and bug free place to stay.There is a lot of construction going on in Waikiki and eventually it will be a new little city. As for other other hotels to stay in, check out Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk - a little pricier but it's a top notch place and it's brand new....top to bottom. I'm sure it has great shower pressure too!Best of luck during your stay in beautiful Waikiki....wherever it may be!

<Content>Good Value We booked this trip with Expedia and it was one of the most affordable vacation packages we found. I viewed the hotel website and saw that the rooms looked good and the property was recently renovated. Finding the hotel can be a bit of a pain but we found it nonetheless. The front desk staff was very friendly and attentive. Some of my dislikes were of course the parking situation. For this particular reason I would not stay at this hotel again. First of all the hotel parking area is located under ground, and there are about 10 parking spots that are designated to the hotel. Which is absurd, considering the amount of guest rooms in the hotel. So if you cant find parking in the undergound lot then you must go to the public parking next to the hotel which is operated by a lift so your car is in an elevated garage. It takes about 5 to ten minutes to get your car in and out, and then you have to take into account mechanical problems. One night we could not get out car out of the garage because the lift was broken!!! On top of that the parking is $15 a day which is a rip off. The rooms were clean but amazingly our sheets were never actually changed until I placed a note on the bed for them to change the sheets. The bathroom was also clean but they could have done a better job with the renovation process, especially in the shower. Also there are many clubs and bars along with the international market place near the hotel. So it can get pretty loud late at night. Overall the hotel is a good value if you dont plan to be in your room very much. It is located in the center of the action and I mean action. After 10pm the freaks come out on Kuhio Avenue so watch out, it can be a little frightening. We had a good time.

<Content>love it we stayed there from january 1-5 2007. it was a great experience. we go to O'ahu every year and stay around Waikiki for the cheapest vacation package we can get online, and I can say that this hotel was the best so far for its price. the room was very nice and spacious with microwave and fridge. the location was perfect. we wake up early to go out to the beach so the noises from the garage in the morning was not a problem, but for some nights the noises from bars/club downstair and across the street were annoying for those who go to bed early. the frontdesk and maid service were nice too. we will love to stay here again!

<Content>aqua waikiki wave good value for the price. we paid $101/nt and given a room on the 11th floor. continental breakfast was included in the price but we only availed of it only once. it consisted of coffee and a small danish. or you can use the breakfast voucers for $3 off the restaurant's breakfast menu. there's a paid parking lot right next to the hotel for $10/overnight. we parked here. there's also a starbucks and st germain french bakeshop nextdoor where we decided to take our remaining breakfasts in waikiki. our room was clean and comfortable, had 2 double beds. contrary to other reviews on this hotel, we did not notice any street noise from our room. free coffee for hotel guests was also a nice treat. this was served vending machine style as you exit the elevator.

<Content>Great experience My wife, my daughter (10 yrs) and I stayed at Aqua Waikiki Wave (AWW) between 12/19 and 12/26 with the average cost of $130/day booked from [--]. We like this hotel very much. It's located in the center of the Waikiki area, one block from the beach. The famous International Market Place is at the next door. It's one short block from the Kalakaua St. which has many restaurants and brand-name shops. The hotels on this street cost at least 30% more than AWW. The Seaside Gill Bar which serves good breakfast with the lowest price in town is one block away. The Check-in process was fast. The hotel employees are friendly. One time I asked a location which was not on a map, an employee printed a Mapquest direction for me. They provided beach towels for free. There is an Expedia.com desk in the lobby. We bought tickets for Ploynesian Culture Center from the agent. We also got an Expedia shopping bag from her. It's a free gift even people do not buy anything from her. We stayed in the 12th floor. The room is more 300 square feet with partial ocean view. The room is very clean with microwave, refridgerator, a flat panel TV and a DVD player. The newspapers are delivered at the door each morning. The hotel gives us 14 $3 cupons which can be used for breakfast in a restaurant next door. Parking is crowded. In two nights, we came back late and had to use the overflow parking facility, which is next to the hotel. It is not convinent to get our stuff after our car is stored. Parking fee is $15/night which is common and relatively cheap in the Waikiki area. The hotel restaurant serves Chinese food. Food quantity is small and the quality is so so. In general, we like its location, roomy and clean room and friendly and helpful employees.

<Content>The Wave was ok We stayed at the Waikiki Wave over Thanksgiving. For the money we spent, the accomodations were fine and suited our needs. The location was perfect in its proximity to everything in Waikiki. On the whole, it is an average hotel....clean beds (though sheeting was too small and kept getting undone), clean bathrooms (water pressure could have been better), and nice amenities. We weren't expecting a resort-like hotel, just a clean place to use as a home-base. Our room was located on the street-side and overlooked an alley, so like what other reviewers wrote, it can be loud at night (I needed earplugs one weekend night). Basically, if you are seeking a hotel with the luxuries of a resort (spa, pool, dining rooms), the Wave is not for you. But if you are seeking a clean, comfortable, affordable and safe place to stay, I would certainly recommend the Wave. Mahalo.

<Content>Good value for the price We stayed at the Waikiki Wave for 5 nights in early December. The location was great- close walking distance to the beach, lots of shopping and restaurants and plenty of bus stops for our excursions. We didnt have a rental car (you dont need one unless you're going far outside of Honolulu) so didnt have to deal with parking. The coupon booklet that we got on check-in saved us a bunch of money on museums. Many places that we already planned to visit were in the booklet. The room was nice. A little rundown in the bathroom still- the shower still looked old (but clean) and our toilet ran constantly. We also didnt get new soap/shampoo unless we tipped, and the maid made us buy the coffee packets from her at $1 a piece. Which is still cheaper than Starbucks, but bothered me a lot, since I've traveled a lot and never stayed anywhere else that charged for the mini coffee packets.The hallways are not up to the level of the rooms, but they're clean and well lit. Our room was quiet and we had a small ocean view. Overall, it was a really good room for the price we paid ($540 for 5 nights) and we felt comfortable there for the time we stayed.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Just returned from a stay at the Waikiki Wave Aqua Reef and I loved the accomodations. The room was large and had a microwave and refrigerator. The bathroom was bright and clean with plentiful towels. The staff were great. Agnes the tour arranger was a wondeful help, Kudo's to Daniel for all his help.I loved the location and its proximity to all the places I wanted to visit. The bus and trolleys were right outside our hotel and the many plces to eat were all a short walking distance. The view from our balcony across to the Royal Hawaiin and the ocean were superb. We did not need a rental car because we were so close to everything. Will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Just an average hotel This was a pretty average hotel. The room was clean but did not have much character. Shampoos and other accessories were not replaced unless a tip was provided to the staff. The place was modern and in a handy location though. The main problem was the noise from the street that went on until all hours of the night.

<Content>Aqua Waikiki Wave, great experience We stayed here for one night precruise and would have liked to stay longer. The King bed room was $110, $122.56 with tax, and was just remodeled. Our room on the third floor was huge, really more like a suite. It had two balconies with floor to ceiling glass windows. The bedroom could be fullly or partially closed off by a pocket door shoji screen. The other room had a sofa, desk, table and chairs, microwave and fridge, large closet, and dresser. We did not use the flat screen TV or DVD, but the wireless internet is excellent (I'm using it to prepare the review). We got a free beach bag, a book of 2 for 1 coupons, and the friendly desk staff lent me a stapler for our luggage tags. I used the $3.99 offer to order take out breakfasts from the Big Kahuna in the building. We had no trouble finding a parking space in the garage under the hotel, and at $15 including in and out privileges, it's a pretty good deal.

<Content>Loved the Wave! I stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave in November and absolutely loved it! We were upgraded from a standard Aloha Suite to a Partial Ocean View Aloha Suite on the 12th floor overlooking Royal Hawaiian Hotel and the view was fantastic! The renovations are great and really modern, yet comfortable. The price was outstanding for the new rooms and location (you could actually still smell the new carpet/fabric smell). Trevor at the front desk was great and very friendly. Housekeeping did a fantastic job and the new beds were glorious. As a local travel agent that does group bookings, I will definitly recommend this hotel to my next group (or anyone else I can). Growing up in Honolulu, I have seen my fair share of hotel rooms/properties and have to say the the Wave is one of my favorites. Great job Aqua Waikiki Wave for giving an old rundown hotel a new face and feel! I will definitly stay here again!Insider Tip: Request a room on as high a floor as possible and away from the street. Paying for a higher category is worth it!

<Content>Kind of Dingy for being "new," but the staff is great I recently traveled to Waikiki for work and opted to save my company some money by not staying at the conference hotel. Instead, I found the Aqua Waikiki Wave -- only a few blocks from my conference hotel, but over $100 cheaper per night, and the hotel was advertised as BRAND NEW-- opening in November of 2006! How cool would that be!? I could stay in this brand-new hotel decorated in a mid-century furniture -- sounds great!Well, the hotel may be new as a name, but the facilities are not new. They simply bought an old building, changed some things, and call it new. The elevators have torn-up paneling in them; the room's carpeting was old and faded; and my alarm clock didn't work -- the digits didn't even display. Also, I was short-sheeted every night.I think there are better options in Waikiki. After my conference, I switched hotels and found one that was equally old, lower in price, and offered more amenities, including an in-room kitchenette, on-site laundry, and (best of all) FREE parking. My room at the AQUA Waikiki Wave was on the westside of the building. At first, I overlooked a huge chilling unit for the neighboring building, but the staff quickly moved me to a higher floor so I could get a better view. From here, the view was much better. The westside does hover above the International Marketplace, which (for me) got pretty loud on a Saturday night, since I had to work the next morning. I would recommend considering requesting a room on the eastside of the building.

<Content>Aqua Promise was remarkable. Harmony airlines booked a 14 day package at our first destination Aqua Aloha Hotel. We had such a great trip and wonderful stay we decided to stay another 10 nights in Wikiki.We had difficulty getting a room so I phoned the Aqua Promise ...a promise to help anytime of day or night to solve any situation. The owner and CEO of Aqua hotels took a personal interest in our booking and located another property. The property was Aqua Waikiki Wave. A beautiful, fresh, clean, newly designed trendy room awaited us.The staff greeted us and made our stay a 10 out of 10.We will deffinetly return to the Aqua hotels...there are now ten of them.....and return to a peaceful, newly decorated hotel soon.MahaloThe Smiths G/L

<Content>Friendly, Comfort away from Home We went to Hawaii to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. We were looking for a 3 star hotel with very clean rooms to stay in for 2 days prior to our Hawaiian cruise. Then we would look for another hotel after we arrived in Hawaii, possibly a 4 or 5 star, after our 7 day cruise. Well we found both places to stay once we checked into the Aqua Waikiki Wave (was Coral Reef). The rooms were very clean, the bedding had that just washed smell, no signs of mold or dirt anywhere around the shower or fixtures in the bathroom. The staff is extremely helpful, we needed additional towels after a visit to the beach, less than five minutes after the phone call the towels were delivered. James, is the guy that helps with baggage or almost anything you need, was a super help. He told me how to get around the town (without a rent car), the best restaurants, places to visit, tours available and he would get you a taxi in no time. We were able to meet Lynette McDonald the General Manager of the hotel, we thought she was just out for that moment. She was out helping hotel guests, assisting the check in folks, and passing on parking and local information. She was doing this each day! Talk about special attention to guests. The hotel is on Kuhio Ave, less than a block from the international Marketplace. There are several shopping areas close by, we had a several choices of places to eat within easy walking distance. There is an 鈥淎BC鈥?and 7-11 stores (convenient stores) within two minutes walking distance from the hotel, to pick up some snacks and those small forgotten items. Waikiki beach is an easy 10 minute stroll from the hotel. With many small shops and stores along the route, we passed on getting a rental car. The only down side to the trip to Hawaii, was being there during the earthquake! Well talk about a hotel stepping up and taking care of their guests. Electricity was lost for the entire island after the earthquake for over 10 hours. Lynette McDonald (general manager for the hotel) was all over the place assisting and calming nerves. I asked her about how she was handling all this, she had never been thru an earthquake and here she was taking care of all us and reassuring us. The hotel鈥檚 generator had the lobby area functioning and well lit, so well many people off the street wanted to come in thinking this hotel was the only one in the city with electricity. The hotel staff and hotel Owner (yes, the Owner showed up), provided food, soda, water, fans, and earthquake information all day. When we go back to Hawaii, we will stay at this hotel. Our stay was almost like staying with friends you have known for awhile. The front desk, maids, and James (don鈥檛 know his title), and everyone at the hotel has a help the guest anyway possible attitude. Great place to stay, great value. Even on checking out, the front desk folks printed my boarding pass for my flight back. We are already thinking about what to do on our next visit to Hawaii, we know what hotel to stay in.

<Content>Needs improvement I stayed at the Wave for a week at the end of October. The rooms looked great - everything was new and there was even a flat screen TV. I had no problems with the fittings or furniture, but what I did have a problem with was the bathroom - it was tiny, and you could tell the shower/bath was still from the old hotel - which I did not like. The shower pressure sucked too, a normal 10-minute shower ended up taking half an hour because the water came out in a weak stream. And the water in my sink took ages to go down --- about an hour. That was not good. I also didn't like the bed linen - the sheets and blankets were thin and pilled. Definitely not the high quality kind you'd expect from a boutique hotel. I also had problems with my door as it did not close properly. You had to literally slam it shut. I was not happy with the housekeeping department. Not once during my whole week's stay was my coffee decanter washed or even rinsed! I found the cleaning staff to be very shoddy with their job. It seemed like they were just intent on getting in there, doing whatever they could in a few minutes, and getting the heck outta there without making sure they had done their job properly. Does anyone even check if the staff have cleaned the rooms properly? Also, they didn't bother making my beds right. I came back one afternoon to find my sheets neatened out on the bed but not tucked in. On the positive side the Wave is in a great location, and the front desk staff are friendly and helpful. You can still see traces of the Coral Reef at the Wave, but I suppose with time, that will go. If the Wave wants to be considered a boutique hotel by well-travelled customers like myself, they need to lift their game by investing in better quality bedlinen, hiring more competent and energetic cleaning staff, and seeing to their plumbing and water pressure problems. Otherwise I thought everything else was OK.

<Content>Great Service and Location I just got back from a short stay at the Aqua Wave Waikiki and had a wonderful time! The location of the hotel was perfect and quite affordable too. The staff there was very friendly and quite accomodating to our requests. We were given a room on the top floor so we had a great view of the city. The parking situation can get hectic but ample parking is available in a structure just next door to the property. The new renovations to the property were much needed and well liked by other guests we spoke with staying there! I had seen the property years ago when it was a Resort Quest property and it was just dark, dingy and in bad need of a face lift. I must say that although the renovations look great, the structure itself is quite dated so I can understand how the Aqua did what they could given the circumstances. If you're looking for a friendly atmosphere, check out this property and you won't be dissapointed! Trevor at the front desk was great as well and so was the GM, Lynette. Thanks Aqua Waikiki for a great stay!

<Content>Very good value I booked this trip with only one day's notice thru Expedia.This hotel used to be the crappy Coral Reef. The renovation to an Aqua hotel appears to be complete. Good things:1. A real bargain for the location ($124 a night.)2. Central air (very cold) instead of a wheezing window unit.3. HUGE room (a queenbed AND a king, with tons of floor space and 2 balconies.) Newly decorated, very clean.4. I really liked the way the beds were made, crisp white triple sheeting. No blankets, no skanky bedspreads.5. Good location in central Waikiki, 5 minute walk to beach. Next to the Int'l MarketPlace (which I hate but most people like.) 6. FREE wireless internet!! This was a great bonus. 7. The staff was very pleasant.8. Fridge and microwave.9. Lots of places to stock up on drinks and snacks nearby, Starbucks across the street.Bad things:1. Parking is impossible. (This is a Waikiki issue, not only for this hotel.) The garage is tortuous, I never did find a place in it. Did not use the giant auto storage complex next door (cars are stored using lifts and conveyor belts, no easy in-and -out.)2. This is NOT a resort so there are no resort amenities like beautiful public rooms, turn down service, restaurants, fancy shampoos.3. No view, I looked out to the parking garage. But I knew in advance there would be no view.4. Bathroom is OK, nothing luxurious but clean; water pressure is sketchy.5. The location on Kuhio Ave can seem seamy, especially at night. I have been to Honolulu about 75-80 times, I have stayed in every category of hotel. The Waikiki Wave was really a good value however I fear the prices will go up as soon as word gets out about the renovations. I enjoyed my stay in a huge clean room with a/c! ALOHA

<Content>Classy and Contemporary I stayed at the Aqua Coral Reef (now Aqua Wakiki Wave) in July 2006 and stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms. They were remodeling the lobby at the time but the renovated room was phenomenal. Everything about the room, from the furniture to the art decor was thoughtfully planned.The locale is central to Waikiki shopping/restaurants and within a few minutes of the beach. - The entire staff was courteous and professional; I highly recommend staying at this hotel. Furthermore, the price was very reasonable and I intend to stay there during my next visit to Hawaii. If you're planning a trip to Hawaii, save yourself some time and enjoy the what the Waikiki Wave has to offer.(---)

<Content>Great Location My husband and I stayed here from Nov. 6-13, 2006. You can tell they have done some upgrades to the hotel, and skimped in other places. The location is fabulous! You can walk anywhere downtown. Parking is horrendous! You pay $15 a day for a spot, but are not guaranteed one and if you park over the lines, you get a ticket.The good parts of the hotel - great location; friendly staff; new beds; clean rooms.The bad parts about the hotel - the seal around the front door is not good, so light comes in from the hallway; the staff did not know where certain restaurants were, parking is bad; low water pressure in the shower.Would I stay here again? Yes, but only if I were interested in staying in the city. We preferred the north shore area and traveled up there every day.

<Content>Watch out! Prior to our visit, we called to make sure they had a pool. They do, but it's exceptionally small and located off an ally where people go for their smoke breaks. There is no view other than an ugly fence, no landscapeing other than an apartment with old ugly balconies, and I would have been ashamed to have told anyone that there was one in the first place. We stayed on the 14th floor in room 1417 with a partial view of the ocean, IF YOU WENT OUT ON AN EXCEPTIONALLY NOISY BALCONY. The predominate view was that of a Thrifty Rental Car Drop off point where they were washing returned rentals. Coffee was provided on the first day but it cost an additional $1 per day thereafter. This is NOT A THREE STAR HOTEL and neither of us would stay there again or recommend it to anyone. It's only fine points was that it was only a couple blocks to the beach. They advertise knee deep plush mattresses, and they were adequate, but certainly not knee deep. Friendly staff, but look elsewhere if you want to enjoy your stay... Unless you're on a serious budget and get a good deal at the Aqua Waikiki Wave.Sorry.

The rooms were absolutely gorgeous, very spacious and most importantly comfortable! The staff was really firendly and the location was unbeatable. I would recommend this hotel to any type of traveller. This hotel has /is going through extensive reno's and they really have made a world of difference. This boutique hotel offered a great atmosphere, and I will be sure to send many of my clients there in the future. Thanks again to Robin for the great expeirience at your property.

<Content>Had a great visit! I booked a package to Hawaii through an online travel agency/website and was booked into what was then the Coral Reef Hotel on Kuhio in Waikiki. I had stayed at the Coral Reef in the past - due to the area it is located in (right behind the Int'l Market Place) I knew it would be okay even though I was well aware that the Coral Reef had seen better days. I was just thrilled to be going to Waikiki!A couple of weeks before the trip I wanted to look up something in the hotel ammenities list and could not locate Coral Reef online at all. I knew they'd recently been purchased by the Aqua Resorts group, so I went to their website, located the address on Kuhio and found it now belongs to the Waikiki Wave. I then discovered that the renovations had just been finished and they were having their grand re-opening with the new name - Waikiki Wave.The renovations included the entire hotel and took a run-down, tired hotel and made a little gem of it. The front desk/lobby area is the nicest part of the project - IMHO. The hallways are freshly painted with new carpet - but it wasn't a really great job, but I'm quite a nit-picker (I watch too much HGTV!), but it is better than it used to be. The elevators could have used some updating, though, but you can't have everything. I never went to the pool so I can't comment on that.The rooms were newly painted, but (like the hallways) it was over the previous paint, which is obvious in some spots (like a few places where it is already peeling off), but it looks better and is cleaner than it was before. Overall the renovated rooms are nicer than they were, but there was a lot left lacking for a renovation project of such a magnitude.The showers still have the original old tiles and hardware - faucets and showerheads are very outdated, but the marble vanity top and sink are nice, as are the matching marble tops in the bedroom. While taking a bubble bath one evening I noticed the old pipes underneath the bathroom sink/vanity area and it was apparent all they'd done in this area was slap on some paint - and did a pretty sloppy job of it too. The bathroom door had been previously damaged - you could see the ripples of it through the new paint job - the bottom of the door was jagged and the paint was already peeling off; they had put shiny new doorknobs on though. One thing that I thought was pretty disgusting were the vents - they had been painted over but you could see how terribly dirty they were - they obviously never cleaned them before they painted them. What it boiled down to (IMO) is that the renovation of the rooms themselves consisted largely of many cans of paint and hanging up some pretty pictures. They did upgrade the frig and add a microwave which is great. The complimentary newspaper each day was a plus I enjoyed.Although I did find some things to complain about, on the whole I enjoyed my stay and the new hotel and would stay there again in a heartbeat. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location can't be beat. I loved sitting on the lanai and watching the birds and the shoppers down on Duke's Lane and looking out over the top of the Royal Hawaiian. The parking situation needs some tweaking but the staff indicated that was in the works. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone who is budget-conscious, but not to those who want a lot of perks and luxuries - this just isn't the place. But if you want an affordable, safe, decent place to lay your head, store your stuff and shower off while you're in Waikiki - this is a great place.

<Content>Pretty good with some exceptions We were at the hotel during the end of the construction. The rooms are very nice and clean, they were just finishing up the lobby so don't know too much about that. The front desk staff are excellant, the most helpful and friendly. The location is great for Waikiki Beach, walk out your hotel and your in the International Market Place. We were there during the earth quake, it was pretty damn scary, the entire island was without power for over 14 hours. Luckly the hotel had a back up generator that powered the elevators and lobby lights, no AC or any power to the rooms. The hotel staff went out of their way to make everyone comfortable and did as much as possible. The only problem with this hotel is the parking, it is the worse I have seen in any hotel. If you don't need a car don't get one. Other than that I would stay there again.The restraunts in the hotel aren't that good, but there are many close by.

<Content>Great time at the Wave We arrived at the Wave a little before check in, but they were able to get us to our room right away. The lady at the front desk was extreamly nice and helpful. It took less then 5 minutes to check in. They were working on the elevators so only one was working. We had to wait for the second elevator because a large group checked in right before we came, but that was no big deal.The rooms are very nice. They have a microwave, refriderator, and coffee maker in the room. They also have a flat screen TV, not huge but just fine.The staff was wonderful and accommodating.The only thing that was not the best was there is a big night club across the street and in the early morning the police were out and you could hear some fighting going on. Request a room off of the street in the back of the hotel.
