<Content>Excellent I stayed in this hotel for 4 days for a New Year's trip. The hotel's location is really very convenient. It is not in a busy street, so it is not noisy during the night, but it is only about 10 minutes walk away from the city centre, what is excellent indeed. We had a double-bedroom, which was small, but still large enough and very clean. The beds are comfortable. There was a large TV-set in the room and no mini-bar at all, but there is a large supermarket very, very close to the hotel, where you can buy drinks. There were two machines with coffee and other drinks in the lobby, but both were out of order. The bathroom is very small, but so cute, I liked it very much, with a huge shower-cabin. There is no hair-drier available in the room, but you can borrow one at the reception-desk. Breakfast was included and very good. Hotel staff is very polite and helpful. The room and the bathroom were cleaned every morning and towels were changed regularly.I would certainly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Decent! This hotel is great for a cheap getaway to Amsterdam. The only thing I had against it, was the location. The location was ok during the day, it was close to one of the tram lines, so very convenient. However, at night, a girl walking around is not the best idea. It was very strange at night.The room itself was great, we had a double, which was pretty big, breakfast included. The only thing is that they needed to spray the bathroom a bit better, because when we got there it smelled like a wet dog, granted pets are allowed. Besides that the room was very clean, there was A/C (which from my travels through out Europe, is a big luxury). If you need one with a better location, I would definitely look into the Ibis Hotel Centre.

<Content>Quiet location. We stayed at this Ibis for 2 nights recently. The location is great - central enough to be convenient, but far enough away from the main highlights to be peaceful. It's off the main road, coming away from the train station to the left. There is another Ibis very near to the train station, but this doesn't have triple rooms.The room itself was compact, but clean, warm and the bathroom (or should I say 'bath'pod') was fab - the shower was powerful and there's good light in there, even though there's no window.There are no drinks / drink machines in the room, so I would recommend you take these - there are vending machines in the lobby, but these are pricey.The breakfast wasn't included in the deal and for the choices on offer, I felt 14Euros was a bit too much - I guess it's the same as most hotel chains though.The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable.I would probably stay here again.

<Content>Good price, reasonably good location Stayed for a week in July in a triple room. We had a room on the ground floor, with a window to an inside patio. The room was a bit small for three single beds. One of the beds was shoved under the window and not very comfortable. The room was clean, and the bathroom was also clean. The shower had very good water pressure, although it did not evacuate all that fast. The service was very good, very nice people at the front desk. The hotel is located near the centre, you can walk everywhere from the hotel. It's not in a very populated street, so it's not noisy at all. The price was very good. All in all, a very pleasant stay. This is a bare basics hotel, exactly what we needed, and just what you come to expect from an Ibes hotel.

<Content>No problems, Would stay here again Stayed here for 4 nights. Room was small but clean.Breakfast buffet was fine. Online reservation looked like it was included but was actually itemized on final bill (we did not pay for the mornings we did not eat)Occasional dinner/drink in the restaurant/bar downstairs was perfectly OK.Front desk staff helpful and friendly.One night there were loud noises in the corridor at 1am but that can happen anywhere.

<Content>A great base to explore Amsterdam For those familiar with the Ibis chain of hotels I shouldn't have to explain that these are 3 star family style hotels that are based on a pretty basic formula. Our room was bigger than average and faced onto a canal that runs at the back of the hotel. It was peaceful and the view was very pleasant.We had chosen this hotel for its central location and were able to walk to all the major sights in the city which is a great advantage.Although the hotel doesn't have a garage they were able to organise parking close by at a reasonable daily rate (by Amsterdam standards!). Breakfast was the usual buffet arrangement but did also include a selection of hot dishes. We had dinner in the hotel on the first night and the food was simple and sensibly priced.Essentially, this is a well run, no frills establishment with very friendly staff that is extremely well located.

<Content>pleasent stay at the stopera have just spent a night , on a short amsterdam break at the stopera , and have very few complaints ! the first port of call was reception , the receptionist was a little unwelcoming to say the least ! however , every one else we met at the hotel was freindly and welcoming , so maybe she was just having a bad day ! our room was'nt ready , so we left our luggage and went out for the day . the hotel has a large storage room for cases behind reception , but my only concern was that it was'nt locked and you could just go in without any one questioning you ! a word of advice as well it gets VERY full ! the room itself was very clean , and the bathroom , while small was spotless .breakfast was included and was a selection of hot and cold items , and was more than adaquate .the hotel is located slightly away from the centre , and those with mobilty problems may prefer to be a bit more central . for us it was about a 15-20 min walk to the dam square .although the cafe in reception was open 24 hours a day , there did not appear to be any room service , which would have been nice as there was no facilities to make hot drinks in the room itselfbut over all we had a very nice stay and would recomened the stopera !

<Content>Everything you need The Ibis Stopera was a great little hotel. The hotel was clean and neat, the neighborhood is safe and easy to get to, near Waterooplein. It鈥檚 about a mile walk from the Central Train Station though there鈥檚 a tram and a metro stop a few blocks away. There鈥檚 a big supermarket right around the corner (which was nice) and a bakery a few blocks past that. There鈥檚 a bar/restaurant in the hotel which was one of the highlights -- both the food and the service were outstanding. The staff was great with our two kids and allowed my wife and I to have something close to a 鈥渞eal鈥?meal out for a change. The prices in the hotel and the restaurant were decent value for money, though nothing in Amsterdam is exactly cheap.The rooms are your standard Ibis chain rooms 鈥?neat, clean and a bit on the small side. But the staff set up a baby cot in our triple room (another thanks for the staff) and we made it work. Bathrooms were very small but nice, and I have to agree with a previous reviewer on the excellent showers. My family and I enjoyed our stay at the Ibis and we鈥檇 recommend it to friends staying in Amsterdam.

<Content>Satisfied with the service My cousins and I just returned from a trip to Amsterdam. We shared a triple room and it was reasonably spacious. I liked that the room was clean and when we called for help with the safety deposit box and asked for a hair dryer, they came within 5 minutes. It was in a quiet neighborhood but still close enough to the heart of the city. (approx. 15 min walk to central station and 10 min to dam square) Few min walk to metro and tram stations.Just be aware to read the fine print when it tells you that breakfast is included. We didn't get breakfast until the 3rd day (we thought it was included everyday).

<Content>Best avoid unless heavy smoker Just returned from Holland. Stayed 2 nights at Ibis Amsterdam Stopera. Terrible experience. Never ever again.I booked this hotel through Ibis website. Paid Euro 178.5 for 2 nights. Before booking it, I have gone through reviews on Tripadviser. I chose it because of its location and price range. I booked a non-smoking rooom for 2 nights. We checked in around 2pm. The room was stink!! like a hevey smoker room. The room faced a main road. Either we opened the window trying to get rid of the smell, but noise from the main road or we had a peace and quiet night, but hold our breath as long as possible. We went to talk to receptionist, but we were told 'there was not non-smoking room available. This was rather strange considering checking in time 2pm onwards and we checked in 2.30pm. I thought that perhaps it was full, ok, fair enought.The following morning, we contacted the receptionist again. This time the staff said that there was not non-smoking room in this hotel! Is it possibile? The staff did not offer any help, neither friendly. they looked us as if we were the one making all the fuss! Is it too much to ask for a NON-SMOKING room while staying. I won't recommend to friend.

<Content>Fabulous view and location Stayed in a triple room just before Christmas. Typical chain hotel, tiny room with no tea making facilities, but the view couldn't be beaten - ALWAYS recommend a canal view. The shower was awesome too. The best thing was the location - a hop, skip and jump from everywhere you need to be, but quiet enough to feel the real Amsterdam. Highly recommend it - especially the very handsome man at the 'Old Rickety House' pub around the corner. Will definately be back next year!

<Content>Good clean hotel Stayed here for 2 nights, paid 79euros a night, which is excellent value for Amsterdam. Clean, modern and decent location. This was a football trip so it was ideal for a big party of blokes, if it was me and the wife, I would probably choose one of the small family run hotels, were you get a little bit more of the true Amsterdam. But this was ideal for this trip, easy to get to all the attractions and tram stop 2 minutes away on foot.

<Content>Ok location, great hotel Spent one night at the hotel with my wife. The room is neither luxurious nor large, and the bathroom is also small, but the hotel and room were new, very clean and larger than some we had seen on the internet, judging by the photos. It even had a nice view of one small charming canal.The staff was also very polite and helpful. This hotel is not so well located as the Centraal Station Ibis, but is close to the metro and you get very fast to the heart of the city. Really enjoyed the hotel, the rate was 89 euros.

<Content>Ibis is OK Had some Air Miles spare so we spent Friday through to Monday at the Ibis Stopera. Located about 10 minutes from centre (more if your looking for the 'red light district'!) and therefore noise free while sleeping.The hotel is very clean and has a 'pod' for a bathroom! Only downside to this is the lack of bath though the shower was excellent. Rubbish tele but new flat screens were being delivered while we left and who goes to Amsterdam to watch tele in their room anyway!The breakfast was self service and plenty of choice though the cooked bits didn't include bacon. Maybe i'm just too 'English'Meals were available in the evening from the bar though they weren't cheap.Staff were friendly and helpful.Only other comment is the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room.Overall would definitely reccomend for those seeking an averaged priced place to stay.

<Content>Good Hotel Getting there;If arriving at Amsterdam Central, just get the metro 2 stops to Waterlooplein Stn ( they all go to this one ) cost Euro 1.60. approx 5 min walk easy to find.Hotel;Modern on main street, quick check in, provided with keycard for access to lift and room. Rooms modern, clean and have tv, aircon/heating. The shower room is great and consists sink,toilet and an amazing large walk in shower.Breakfast if its included in your deal is comprehensive, hotel has vending machines.Vincinity;Easy walk to Dam Square, just turn right out of hotel, to junction, turn right again, past supermarket, over canal bridge and 1st left ( you will see lights across road and lots of shops, just follow this narrow street and it will get busier as you approach Dam Square.Easy walk to Rembrantplein just go straght ahead at 1st junction ( instead of right) past Waterlooplein metro and over canal bridge and straight on, try the Three Bells pub, good beer,food and music.If you want local just cross the road from hotel to left, up the road at side of fire/police stn and you will find some local pubs/restaurants.

Rooms were very clean and tidy and housekeeping called daily with fresh towels. I had read previous reviews about the shower/bathroom pods and all true, they are the biz!! Didn't get the canal view this time but getting in at 6 in the morning i wasn't that upset,there's always January!!!Enjoy.

<Content>One night in Amsterdam We stayed at the Ibis last weekend (27 Oct 07) and had a triple room for EUR161 for two adults and a 7yo. The room was very clean and the beds comfy. The bathroom looked like it was some kind of space capsule - it was all plastic surfaces and looked like it had been added to the room in one piece (sorry it's hard to explain - i wish I'd taken a picture). The hotel is well located and easy walking distance to most of the major sights. The breakfast was included and was OK but nothing special. Nearby parking was outrageously expensive. The first place we came to was Falcon Parking which was EUR 30 for 24 hours and we thought that was a bit steep but then the next place was EUR45 for 24 hours so we went back to the first place which is cloest the Ibis anyway! I think next time we go to Amsterdam we might stay further out of town but near public transport as it would be a bit cheaper.

<Content>Great Location , Clean Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for three nights during the summer. As we were not staying too long in Amsterdam we wanted somewhere convienent to the night life, restaurants shops etc. This hotel met all such requirements. We walked everywhere we wanted to go, and Amsterdam is a lovely city to walk around. We were no more than ten minutes from all the action, yet the hotel was quite at night with very few passers by. The actual room was basic but very clean and comfortable. They made great use of the space especially in the bathroom and we had a lovely view of one of the canals. Hotel was also great value for money. Perfect. We didn't really eat in the hotel largely due to the fact that we ate while we were out and about so i cannot comment on the food. Staff were friendly and accommodating. It was the ideal place for us to stay.enjoy!

<Content>Perfect for us...great value Stayed here end of august/beginning sept 2007 for 4 nights. The rooms - yes they are fairly basic but for the price I can only praise the Ibis. The ensuites are like little 'pods' but are ingenius and have a fantastic walk in shower. We looked onto a canal which I definitely suggest asking for if they can accommodate this. The staff were nothing short of excellent therefore if you have any problems you always have help at hand.Breakfast was plentiful - with hot and continental breakfast.About a 10-15 min walk from the centre - which we don't mind - but you seem to be there in no time at all. Definitely worth a short walk to save quite a substantial amount of money.Can only recommend the hotel - I'd definitely return after looking at some of the prices of other hotels that are a little more central.

<Content>Nicely located hotel to explore Amsterdam My stay at the IBIS Stopera was very good and I give it top marks for location, access, hospitality and functionality. For UK residents, the IBIS Stopera in Amsterdam is the equivalent of the Travel Inn, Travel Lodge or Holiday Inn Express. Rooms are standard with a double bed with en-suite decent shower and toilet facilities.The hotel is 15 鈥?20 walk to the city centre, 10 min walk to RLD and 5 min walk to the underground train station and overland tram. Getting there from Schiphol is easy. Take the train from Schiphol to Amsterdam Central. At Amsterdam Central take the underground to Waterlooplein (Second stop). If all goes well the whole journey is one hour from Schiphol. Buy a return ticket at Schiphol if you know when you are returning (It鈥檚 鈧?.60 each way). I will also suggest that you buy a 24hr, 48hr or 72 hr travel card, as it can be used on the bus, tram or underground.If you do sleep light, then I suggest you request a canal view room. There are no tea or coffee making facilities but there is a supermarket minutes away. The controlled TV has CNN, BBC1, BBC2, MTV and Eurosport. There is air conditioning as well. To go on the Internet you can use the PAYG computers in reception or buy Wireless Hotspot Pass (鈧?.95 for 60 min) if you want to gain access using your Laptop. I had wireless connectivity in my room, which was quite good. I did not have breakfast and they don鈥檛 try to impose it on you as hotels do in England (Food is cheaper elsewhere). On the whole I enjoyed my stay here and if you are not fussed about being waited on, lush surroundings but want a very decent, clean place to stay then the IBIS will not be a bad choice. I will go back if I go to Amsterdam again.

<Content>Basic (VERY basic) accomodation Room booked here by my company for my stay during IBC 2007. The hotel's web site self-describes this as a 3-star hotel but I would say that 2 stars is more accurate. The good: clean room, lovely shower, friendly staff, okay location. The bad: room is tiny, missing even the most basic amenities (no clock, tissue, wash cloths, ironing board, coffee maker), intermittent outages on expensive wireless internet, weird building layout, concrete floor covered with indoor-outdoor carpet, bathrooom door is spring loaded and can't be propped open, minimal closet space, no drawers (but there are some shelves). I'm going to be here for a week so I was hoping for something a bit more comfortable. Certainly, it could be worse, and it is definitely clean and well-maintained ... just a bit more basic than I was expecting. Amsterdam is frightfully expensive for Americans due to weak dollar relative to Euro (1 EU = $1.36 as I write this).

<Content>Excellent choice for weekend break I booked the Ibis Stopera after trying to find a traditional Dutch BB for a decent price but with no success. Amsterdam is a very expensive place to stay and you really don't get what you pay for.Although the Ibis Stopera seems expensive compared to other Ibis hotel in european cities, the value compared to other chain hotels and small BBs in the area is exceptional. we paid 330 euros for 3 nights room only.The rooms are modern, a good size, cleaned spotlessly, everything in the room in great condition.. as are the hallways, restaurant and foyer.We were at the front of the hotel on the main road and the noise of the cars was not an issue as the rooms are double glazed. We were in room 319.Ate in the restaurant hotel once and service was friendly and swift.One thing to note is that the rooms do not have hairdryers, this was my only negative.Location of the hotel is ideal for city breakers. Right by the Zoo and aquarium, diamond factory, rembrandthuis and about 2 mins away from Macbike, the city's largest bike rental. journey into the very centre of town takes about 10 mins strolling, pleasant walk and no dodgy areas.Highly recommended. would stay there again.

<Content>Not bad Stayed there for 4 nights in July. The hotel is pretty close the the city central and is about a block away from Metro and Tram stops, not to mention about 5 minute walk from one of the cool Town Squares in Amsterdam. We got a pretty decent rate of 99 Euros a night( 141 Euros for the weekends), which isn't bad for Amsterdam since hotels that close into town seem to be pricey. The hotel was clean and easily accessible. But dont get it mistaken, it is a no frills hotel. The walls are very thin so I was woken every morning by the sounds of the staff cleaning in the hallways. This was usually between 10 and 10:30 so if you don't sleep in late, its not a problem. The beds were nicely designed, but were very hard and I had a bit of trouble sleeping on them. Not a deal breaker but should be noted. The bathrooms very very compact but surprisingly since they were designed so well, you didn't notice.The breakfast, well, it was included and it was pretty bad. I am usually not picky with eating, especially when its free, but to put it bluntly, I only ate there once and then bought breakfast from then on at outdoor restaurants.There is Internet access but you have to pay for a pre-paid card.staff was nice and accommodating and they even corrected a problem on my bill without argument. They made it worth it. Also the cleaning of the rooms was great as well.All in all, I would stay there again if i had to but I would probably shop around for a little different experience first

<Content>Outstanding A Real Gem I spent four nights in this quality hotel 4-8 May 2007 .I was very impressed with all aspects of the service I received .Checking in was a breeze and the standard of the room was exceptional .The room was spotless and cleaned to a very high standard throughout my stay .The room featured a huge power shower and a king size bed .My package included breakfast which was served in the bar area .Lots of choice of hot and cold food. The hotel is very central being about 10 minutes walk from central station or a short cab ride .The busy centre of Amsterdam is only a short walk away .The best thing about this hotel I think are the staff .I went to reception several times with various enquiries and was always met with a smile and faultless assistance .The same in the bar where the service was swift and friendly. Although on a busy road the rooms were quiet .I will be returning to Amsterdam shortly and will certainly be staying in this lovely friendly hotel. Recommended

<Content>ibis stopera Stayed for two nights - five girls on a birthday celebration weekend. Booked one double and a triple (a double with an extra bed). Room a little cramped for 3 but a great shower room. Put on different floors (would have been nicer to be nearer to each other). Breakfast included and a very good one too. Lots to choose from and plenty of room to sit. Toaster works best when switched on (as my friend pointed out) but after a late night I was pleased just to make it to the breakfast room. Clean and modern hotel with a nice bar. Pleasant twenty minute walk into the centre of town. Red light district a must see - an eye opener for first timers and not threatening in any way, even though it was jam packed with revellers. Didn't see any trouble and everyone was in a celebratory mood. Dam Square lovely in the daytime ( reminded me of Convent Garden) with street entertainment and cafes. Anne Frank house very interesting and took about half an hour to get in even though the queue was around the corner. Best to book tickets online before you go as you don't need to queue at all. A lovely weekend break in a lovely city. Plenty to do and see and oh so very cheap!! And for goodness sake - watch out for those bikes!!

<Content>overpriced We booked this hotel direct with ibis and paid 鈧?34 for two nights for two with breakfast.What we liked best was the breakfast, it was buffet style with something for everyone, cold and hot food fresh coffee, juice and a selection of teas.I read lots about how nice the shower was in this hotel and yes the shower is lovely, hot and powerful, just what you need when you've been walking all day. However, the bathroom was like a unit that had been fitted in to the room, it was all plastic and felt a bit like an oversized caravan bathroom! We've stayed in several ibis hotels and i don't remember anything like this before.The room itself was what you might call functional, the usual twin beds pushed together that they call a double room, TV with several language channels. A full length mirror but the electric socket was on the other side of the room so very difficult to dry your hair. No tea or coffee but we knew that before we went.Several reviews mention noise but we didn't hear any at all. It was very quiet, a welcome respite from the city centre. Not much going on in the area at all. The bar man was very keen to close up on the two nights we stayed, it was the same man both nights, the first night we arrived quite late and i think he was disappointed that we arrived. the second night we got back at 20 to 1 (it's advertised as being open till 1) only to be told that they were closing early as there was no one there) it's hardly the place you'd want to sit all night but plenty of people must want to have a nightcap before bed. Overall I think it's a basic hotel, handy to be a little out of the centre but too expensive for what you get. Ibis hotels in other big cities are not this expensive

<Content>diissapointed Read your views by other customers. We arrived and I asked if there was breakfast included. We where told no. We stayed three nights. There was no tea and coffee facilities. I could not wash my hair no hairdryers in the room. We booked for three adults one being my 6`2 tall son. He had a small bed only suitable for a child. We paid for the breakfast the first morning it was 11 euros each.=When we had the final bill it was 120 euros for two nights. The last night was 189 euros breakfast had been included. We told then we had no breakfast and the staff where unfreindly and didnt alter the bill. Wedid try to explain we where told it didnt include breakfast on arrival and so ate out. They where most rude and uncaring.

<Content>Great affordable place in pricey Amsterdam! This is a very good 3 star hotel located in the center of Amsterdam. It is a typical Ibis, similar to other Ibis hotels around the globe.Room: The room was big in European standards. The bed was ok and the sheets were very clean. The TV had about 30 channels (5 English speaking channels). The bathroom was pretty small, but the shower was big. Bathroom and room were very clean.Service: The entire staff speaks English. They were all very polite and nice. Check in and check out were a breeze.Location: The location is perfect. It is located in the old Jewish area of amsterdam. It is a 5 minute walk to the Rembrandt house, 5 minutes to Waterlooplein and 10 minutes to Rembrandtsplein.Price: A double romm per nighet costs (at this time of the year) about 90 Euros. This is one of the cheapest 3 star hotels in central Amsterdam, and surely one of the best of them.

<Content>Fab Hotel!! My partner and i have just returned from amsterdam,amazing place indeed! We stayed at the ibis stopera hotel for 4 nights,we had an easy,stright forward check in (didnt arrive there till 8pm) the room was clean and comfortable,but was noisey, as we had a room at the front,so next time i will ask for a room at the rear,the shower was wicked,steaming hot water,and big enough for 2 :O) only thing is they dont provide tea or coffee in the room,but i think most hotels out there are the same,we took our own.it was about a 15 min walk to dam square,turn right out of the hotel and stright on,didnt use the resturant,enough places to eat out for cheaper,didnt do the breakfast either.all the staff were polite and helpful,so i recommend you try this hotel,we will be again!

<Content>All good Admittedly, I can only echo the generally positive sentiment expressed here already.Room was sizeable by European standards for a hotel of this class. Was the regular Ibis look and feel. Limited closet space but enough for a few days. Bed was comfy enough with extra linen provided. Bathroom is a little pod, but was clean with big, hot shower so it's all good. There was a little desk in the room. Also a tv with some English programming. The room also has a safe. Remember: no tea/coffee or bar fridge in the room.Location is good, but not great. Two stops on the Metro from Central Station, also on a Tram route that runs to Central Station if you prefer a view over speed (although the difference is only a few minutes). The walk into the central area probably takes about 10 minutes. There's a Macbike (bike hire company) at the end of the road, so if that's your preferred route for exploring Amsterdam, then the location is very good.The breakfast is a generous European affair (pastries, rolls, ham, cheese, fruit, cereals, yoghurt) with eggs and sausages thrown in for good measure. A few Dutch touches are thrown in too, like chocolate sprinkles for the bread.All in all, it was what exactly we expected from an Ibis in terms of comfort, service, cleanliness, etc. so all good.

<Content>Great Value Modern Hotel The Ibis hotel was a great value for the money. It seemed to be almost new, nice bright colors, spotless bathroom. It had Ikea type furnishings but they served their purpose well. What might seem odd to an American tourist new to European travel, is the size of the room or bathroom, but wait till you see their cars! ;) There was a small restaurant right in the hotel lobby, serving daily breakfast (both hot  cold) for only 5 Euros for hotel guests. It was open late too so incase you get hungry late at night (and it can happen in Amsterdam for one reason or another lol) you don't have to walk too far for a pizza.

<Content>Great Hotel Haven't stayed in a 3* hotel for a while, so the main things that I write may not really be relevant.The 3rd bed wasn't a bed, but a pull down one , that said it was comfortable, but there wasn't much spare room. With 3 adults, the lack of adequate storage space would have been a problem, but we were only there two night so it didn't concenr us this time.Had read previous reviews, so knew there were no tea making facilities, nor hairdryer so came prepared. The room was clean and functional, as was the shower room. We did not try the air conditioning, and our room was at the back overlloking the canal so we had no problems with traffice noise.Everyone was more than helpful and very friendly, would have no probelms staying there again

<Content>Great place to explore Amsterdam I stopped at the Ibis Stopera in Amsterdam at the end of Sept 06 for 3 days  had an extremey pleasant stay. I had been struggling to find a hotel in central Amsterdam that was within my budget  not likely to be full of rowdy stag do's. The Stopera was a little more than I'd wanted to pay, however I knew that an Ibis hotel would be a decent standard.We had a double room on the second floor, which also had an extra single bed in it. The room was cleaned every day  I never heard any noise from any other guests. The shower was amazing - huge  hot! The view from the window wasn't much to write home about, I understand the higher floors are better.It took us 10 minutes to walk into the centre of Amsterdam. I didn't set foot in the bar / restaurant at the hotel - it looked nice enough but it seemed to be very expensive.The only down side for me were the directions given on the Ibis website as to how to get to the hotel by public transport. When we came out of the metro station we were lost! So my advice would be to invest in a map!

<Content>Above average Good location with comfortable and quiet accommodations. The shower was exceptional. Note: they do not have wash clothes, or shampoo and conditioner. This was disappointing. Still, this hotel is a very good choice for a visit to this fun-filled city. The staff were helpful and friendly, which contributed to a memorable experience. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an affordable, clean, and safe hotel.

<Content>Super Stopera Just returned from the Stopera, I really liked this hotel. Good sized rooms, very helpful and friendly staff and a good breakfast. Ideal for a short break. We had a lovely canal view for our room. Shower was excellent and a good size. TV had a good selection of English channels - BBC 1 and 2.Staff were very friendly and helped us with table reservations and taxi bookings. Breakfast served 4am to 12! Good choice of bread and meat. Loved have chocolate sprinkles on my croissants and a type of tea I actually drank.

<Content>Amsterdam is great!! We stayed between 26th - 29th August and had a quiet room at the back overlooking the canal. Previous reviews have complained about the noise of other guests and the maids cleaning, but we have no complaints on that score.The room was clean and functional, but if you don't like hard beds, then give this place a miss.We have to agree with comment's about the breakfast. For what it is, it is very overpriced. There are loads of cafe's within walking distance ( all of central Amsterdam is) where you can get a better breakfast for less.Tea and coffee making facilities wouldn't go amiss in the rooms also.

<Content>Good well located hotel JourneyTravelled to Amsterdam with Easyjet from Stansted. Flight was 50 minutes each way. Transferred to Amsterdam Central on a train from the airport - it costs 3 euro 60 cents for a single, but be aware that most ticket machines only accept Credit or Maestro cards. You also need to validate the ticket by stamping it at the entrance to the platform.The walk to the hotel took about 15 minutes from Amsterdam Central station - you can either follow the main road to the left when emerging from the station, or proceed through town, skirting the red light district and on past Waterlooplein to get there.The HotelWe arrived mid morning and requested quiet rooms at the rear which we were allocated. However, we could not get the access cards until after 2pm as the rooms were being cleaned. There is a luggage storage room.When we did access the rooms we found them clean and comfortable. I would describe them as modern luxury student rooms. The en-suite shower was powerful and hot. The TV included BBC1 and BBC2, as well as music and news channels.We did not pay for the 13 euro breakfast, instead opting to use the cafe just down the road (left out of the front doors) where a fried egg sandwich was available for less than 2 euros.The hotel is located less than 5 minutes from Waterlooplein, which is about 5 minutes from Dam Square. All major sites are easily walkable.SightseeingLots to see and do. We did a canal cruise (6 euros), the Heineken Museum (10 euros - including 3 beers), Ann Frank House (7.5 euros) and diamond factory (free).There are lots of choices for food and drink - we had Thai, Mexican and fast food. Prices vary, but it is possible to eat quite cheaply, and the supermarket on Waterlooplein has 70 cent drinks machines.It was an overall enjoyable trip.

<Content>Not Great by Any Means I stayed at the Ibis Stopera for three nights at the end of July for the Rolling Stones concert . I booked the hotel largely based on reviews on this site, breaking my golden rule for short city breaks. I.e that the hotel should be right in the middle of the action. I can only blame myself but I was slightly disappointed. This hotel has a number of problems.Firstly location. It is situated on one of the most non descript streets in Amsterdam, a decent walk from the main nightlife, with very few cafes, bars or shops of any description. It is not much fun walking back late at night through deserted streets. The street outside the hotel, despite having a lot of traffic has virtually no public transport either.Having been in Amsterdam before I thought this slightly offside location would guarantee a decent nights sleep but the hotel is popular with the British stag trip crowd so you can expect to be woken between 4 and 5 at weekends by slamming doors and drunken voices singing the virtues of Inger-lund If the Brits dont wake you then the housekeeping will.The second issue are the prices. The room rates are not too bad for cental Amstaerdam (although this is stretching the idea of central) but everything else is expensive. Breakfast is a bit pricey at 13 euros (and quite mediocre) whereas internet acces in the lobby at 5 euros for 15 minutes is a total ripoff.Although the hotel is clean and fresh, the public areas are extremely souless and joyless.The bar/restaurant is possibly the least cosy I have experienced in many years of travelling. Leave this hotel to the tour groups and the lager louts.ChrisStockholm

<Content>OK but nothing special The Hotel is in an ideal position. It is far enough away from the centre but is only a 30 minute walk to Ann Franks house which is the other side of the central part of Amsterdam. The hotel and rooms are clean and tidy although they never removed used coffee cups from the room whilst we were there. We had to bring these up from breakfast as there are no tea making facilities in the room. The breakfast is quite expensive at 13 Euros each and I feel it isn't worth it.Our room was at the back with nice views over a canal which was very quiet. As mentioned in other reviews, there is a good large shower. Overall, the hotel was OK but nothing special.

<Content>great experience at ibis stopera stayed at the hotel from the 12th of june until the 15th. everything about the hotel was well above average. our room was ready when we arrived at 8 am and we were allowed to check in. room was in the back overlooking the water. it was lovely and thankfully, air-conditioned. There was a heat wave in Amsterdam and the temperatures were in the 80's. the hotel made sure we had 2 separate beds as requested. The bedding and the shower was wonderful. The staff, I cannot say enough about. These young men and women were so patient with everyone. They made all kinds of calls for us to get reservations in certain restaurants. Circled maps for us detailing the way for us to get to anywhere we wanted to go. Never rushing anyone that was waiting to ask questions or check in or out. My sister-in-law had a knee problem and every night when we came back to the hotel we stopped at the bar for ice. They were always accommodating. The hotel was very busy at this time with people watching the world cup in the restaurant and bar. but they never made you feel as though you were a nusance to them. We knew when we booked this hotel that it was kind of an economy hotel. Other than not luxury bath items or large closets, or coffee making equipment in the room, the staff, location, cleanliness, air -conditioning, more than make up for these other things. I would love to visit Amsterdam again and once more stay at this hotel. Thanks to everyone who wrote reviews before we finally booked. The hotel was recommended to us by someone who lives and works in Amsterdam, and judges hotels by american standards.

<Content>Excellent accommodation We stayed in the Ibis City Stopera from 19-21 May and once we got our bearings, realised we couldn't have booked a hotel in a better location. All areas are accessible either by tram, foot or water taxi and is in a quiet area. The rooms are not huge but I've seen smaller but they are spotless, with one of the most comfortable beds I've stayed in (and you get a quilt !!) The shower takes up most of the space in the bathroom. It's huge, it's also the best shower I've ever had (even better than the one at home). Staff are very friendly and offer a city map and general advice when checking in. Breakfast was listed as American breakfast and there was ample to choose from. Cereals, different breads, toast, cooked breakfast, cheese, meat, juices. We arrived earlier than check in and left later than check out and they provide storage space for cases. Regarding previous comments about the hotel being too noisy. Yes, we heard people walking down the corridors, yes we heard other guests doors closing but I've never been to a hotel and not heard such noises. The hotel was full and not everyone goes to bed at the same time so its expected!!! Do I have anything negative to say about the hotel? No it was perfect. Would I stay there again? Definately.

<Content>practical and affordable ibis hotel as expected always exceeds the hotel guests expectations. we went there to spend my birthday. as expected the rooms were exactly the same ibis rooms i have been to, the room that we had a very nice canal view in the back portion of the hotel area. There are a few things if only are present could have boost my ratings further such as the following: more nearby convenience stores(despite there is a nearby grocery store), tram or bus transports in front of the hotel(because you have to walk a bit further from the hotel to reach waterlooplein metro and tram stations), nearby affordable restaurants and food shops. But overall this hotel is by far good in terms of practicality, affordability and money for value hotel and clean. The staff were very accomdating before i forget. I will come back again to this hotel if ever i come back again to the beautiful city of AMSTERDAM.

<Content>Clean, modern, and well priced OK... Here it is- I'll get to the main points...1. The hotel is actuallly on a very quiet street. Not far from major attractions but far enough that you can't hear commotion.2. The hotel is very clean. 3. My husband and I had a queen sized bed.4. Having an elevator was a definate plus.5. The bar staff was very rude, and we did not visit the bar but only for a pizza late one evening. I had just read it wasn't the best so we opted to use outside resturants. 6. Housekeeping was a little too eager to clean our rooms at 9:30 in the morning. Hey... at least they cleaned. 7. The bathroom was spotless and the shower was considerably large (great for 2!) 8. We brought our own bath towels and I am glad we did... the hotel towels were rough! 9. Staff was friendly and helpful as to how to get around the city and where to go. 10. Great to have a supermarket and bagel store around the corner. 11. Blue Bird coffee shop in close proximity- our favorite!

<Content>good hotel, good price After searching through hundreds of other hotels online i finally decided on the stopera. must say was very impressed. althought fairly small rooms, they were clean and warm, bed was very comfortable and the shower was just divine-couldve stayed in it all day. its closer to town than it appears and there is really no need for trams as its a five minute walk to town and 10 min walk to dam square. really ejoyed coming back here at the end of the day as knew would have a lovely sleep. didnt have the breakfast but does seem a little pricey-just walk into town anywhere to find cheaper alternative. overall with this hotel you know exactly what you're getting and its fairly cheap for being so close to town. recommended.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at the Ibis Stopera last summer, after another booking fell through. I was pleased both with the rate and the room. It was close to everything, and there was a tram stop about two blocks south of the hotel. My room had a lovely view out over the canal behind the hotel, and was large by European standards. The staff was outstanding, and I had a great time chatting with the barman. As a single woman travelling alone, I found it to be safe, quiet, and very clean. I would and have recommended it to friends.

<Content>Vaule for money My partner and I stayed at the Ibis Stopera for 5 nights from 28 Dec 05 - 3 Jan 06. Like most hotels in Amsterdam during this period the Ibis was booked solid. The last 3-star hotel I stayed at was the Avenue (single room) and I had not been impressed. I was very pleased with our choice this time. The location is great and much closer to Dam square and Central station than I was expecting. It was far enough away from the hustle and bustle to be relaxing and quite peaceful (discounting the unavoidable NYE crackers!), yet close enough to comfortably walk almost everywhere. It was always cold and sometimes snowing during our stay yet we never bothered with trams or taxis and walked everywhere with ease. The rooms are cosy and comfortable. They're not big rooms but they're big enough for two adults and they're modern and clean. At all times we found the staff to be enthusiastic, pleasant, helpful and efficient and all had perfect English. They seemed to be quite a young crew, always well groomed and we thought they did a great job considering they were dealing with a full hotel of mainly other young people who were in Amsterdam for NYE party celebrations (as were we - though not so young!). Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, noise from the corridor is evident although we found it to only ever be momentary and never found it to be a source of disturbance. Our only complaint would be the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room. We knew this to be the case when we booked and thought it wouldn't matter, but once there we really missed this facility and also missed the convenience of a mini-fridge. The Ibis Stopera was great value for money and offers the security of what you see on the website is what you get. I would recommend it to all, but I think I missed having a kettle and a fridge a bit too much and will probably look for a different hotel next time just so as to have those facilities.

<Content>Ibis Amsterdam - Great hotel, but a bit noisy! I stayed at the Ibis Amsterdam Stopera from November 19-21, 2005, and I have to say it is a great little hotel. We paid approximately 100 euro a night (average) and couldn't have been happier with the location. Approximately 5-10 minutes from the Waterlooplein metro stop, and maybe 20 minutes to walk to city centre. We were not able to get a non-smoking room because the Ibis doesn't let you request that in advance, and since we arrived at approximately 5pm on a Saturday, all of the non-smoking rooms were taken. The room was spotless other than the stink of smoke, and the shower was easily the best shower I've ever had at a hotel. I wanted to bring it home with me, as it totally beats the shower at my house!Didn't make use of any of the facilities at the hotel, but the desk staff was extremely helpful at answering our questions, providing us with maps and telling us how to get places in the city. My only *real* complaint, other than the smoking room, was that the rooms are not very well soundproofed. There were people going in and out of their rooms, slamming doors constantly, until about 2AM, and the housekeeping staff seemed to find it necessary to stand outside our door (with the Do Not Disturb in plain sight) having an extremely loud conversation in dutch. Ahh well, you can't win em all! And for the price, it really can't be beat! If I was coming back to Amsterdam to party hard and pass out in a drunken stupor, I would definitely stay at the Ibis again. If I'm coming back for a relaxing vacation, I think I would spend a bit more cash for a room that is a bit better soundproofed.

<Content>Ibis Stopera hotel ...noisy I have just returned from a few days in Amsterdam and stayed at the Ibis Stopera. The rooms were not large but spotless and the staff were very friendly. The barman was very helpful and the service was great as I was traveling on my own and eat in the hotel on my first evening.My only word of warning is if you are traveling for business (as I was) try and make sure your room will be on a quiet floor. On two out of the three nights I only got about 4 hours sleep due to various groups of guys going in and out of their rooms until about 4.00am-slamming doors all the while.I did ask to move and was told I couldn't as it was my last night.I realise loads of people go to Amsterdam to have a holiday but some of us do work and it would have been nice to have had some sleep.Maybe they could allocate their rooms a little better.

<Content>Pretty good We visited the Ibis Stopera in mid August and given the relatively high prices for what you get in Amsterdam it gives you good value for money. The location is better than I had been led to believe, you are only a few minutes walk from waterlooplein and the big market there, and a walk of upto 15 minutes takes you to a large number of central areas of interest. As for the hotel, the rooms are clean and well maintained, but they are small and storage space is very limited. The bathroom is small but ample with a good large shower and it is modern and clean. In fact the shower cubicle takes up about 1/3 of the bathroom floorspace. Otherwise nothing special struck me about the hotel, simple, with relatively helpful and knowledgeable staff. Overall weighing all things up I would recommend the ibis stopera if you want a clean room, good location at a good price. If you want lots of space, style and will spend a fair bit of time in the hotel then maybe try elsewhere.

We booked 2 triple rooms for 6 nights from 7/26/05 to 7/31/05. Rooms are very small. One extra single bed squeezed into a regular double bed room, then called it tripble. No radio alarm clocks in both rooms as promised in our bookings. It's a standard, budget hotel. Don't expect any lux treatment. Also, make sure check your bill before signing out. It's been some increases, but not conforming to the booking price. Errors were corrected at the site.

<Content>Excellent No frills, just good clean accommodation. Just on the edge of all that's going on in Amsterdam, which makes it a little oasis of calm but dead central for everything. For the price I would recommend and the breakfast was good and plentiful also. Staff very friendly and helpful. I would also suggest a trip to the Ajax stadium, well worth the visit and I'm not even a football fan.

<Content>Just what we wanted This is exactly the kind of hotel you want whilst exploring Amsterdam. We travelled in a group of 11 with ages from 30-60 and all were very happy with the hotel. It is well placed within walking distance of all areas but also on the metro line for speed of access to central station. The rooms are very clean the bathrooms imaculate with large walk in showers. The staff are very helpful. I would not hesitate to book here again on a return visit and recommend it to all. The price is reasonable. We ate breakfast in others cafes as we simply enjoy the variety. There is a pizza service till midnight should you get the munchies as many do.

<Content>Very good experience all around My husband and I stayed there last week for three days and my husband has stayed there several times previously. The price is moderate. The staff is extremely helpful. The hotel is very clean, comfortable, with modern, sleekly designed rooms. The bathrooms are self contained, very modern units. We had a room on the canal with a great view. There is not one bad thing to say about this place. There was a very hearty breakfast buffet. The staff is friendly, gracious and makes all attempts to meet your requests. The location is very good. You are not likely to go wrong with a stay here!

<Content>Better than expected I looked at the reviews for this hotel and decided to give it a shot. I was able to find a deal for 80 Euros a night for a double room, so I couldn't pass it up. Although our room was a little small, it was still worth it. The hotel is very close to all the major locations. The longest it took us to walk somewhere was about 20 minutes. Four of us were traveling together so we decided to pay 16 Euros a piece to take the canal bus. This service offers 14 different stops at all the major attractions, and you can use it all day until noon the following day. You can get on and off unlimited amount of times. It's very convenient and easy to use and there is also a pick up point about one block from the hotel near the diamond factory. The staff was wonderful - especially Deusa. She told us where to eat, where to go, what was worth seeing and not worth seeing, what cruises to go on and what not to go on, etc. She was wonderful! The only downside is the parking. It's a little pricey if you plan on driving there. The parking garage is across the street and cost us 56 Euros for 2 nights of parking, which is a little more than I had hoped to pay. Also, breakfast is not included. It's an additional 13 Euros per person. Besides those two minor downsides, overall the trip was a blast and the hotel was in wonderful condition with wonderful service. I'd definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>A great choice! Stayed here March 18-20 2005. Got a bargain online. Great room and very friendly staff. We arrived shortly before noon and since our room was ready, we were able to check in early and hit the town. The whole place is spotless! We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant as there are plenty of cafes nearby (breakfast is 13E in the hotel). This hotel is just a short walk from plenty of things to do around town and it's secure. There is a parking garage right across the street so we didn't have to lug our bags all around town either. We'll definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Staggering Distance! Took a group to this hotel in March 2005. Had previously stayed on the outskirts and was expecting this to be pretty basic, being a budget hotel in the city centre. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel was in walking distance of all the city's attractions but just far enough not to be plagued with noise  hubbub! The hotel was spotless and rooms clean and modern with the most amazing shower cubicles (fit 2 or 3 people in if so inclined!) and the most comfortable beds. The only down side was that they didn't have tea/coffee facilties in the rooms. Tasteful bar/restaurant and breakfast (included in the package) was good with both hot  cold choices. They also catered to all needs with early bird breakfast 4-6am, fuller breakfast between 6-11am, then late risers breakfast 11-12 noon - very considerate! Staff were excellent - always helpful, particularly to our coach drivers who they helped immensely in providing cash facilities, helping with notices to stick on the coach (it broke down on arrival) and contacting police, garage etc.Cost was very good - whole trip for 3 days including coach  tunnel crossings about 拢120 - although this was of course with group rates. We usually travel to Amsterdam every 1/2 years and this will most definitely be our hotel from now on.

<Content>Lovely room I went with a group of friends and booked a triple room but tried to change to a twin at the last minute. Unfortunately there were only doubles left but the bed was king size. The large, walk in corner shower was fabulous and the room was clean and tidy and very comfortable. Breakfast was in the cellar-room and continental only but was ok. The staff were polite and helpful. Don't bother with public transport, everything is within walking distance once you've got your luggage from the train station. I'd use the tram to get to the hotel - watch taxi drivers as they tend to rip you off so check out the cost before you get in. We used a taxi for the same journey 3 times and the difference in cost each time was ridiculous. I would recommend this hotel.
