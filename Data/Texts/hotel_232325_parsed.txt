<Content>Good place to stay Four of us stayed at the Hotel. We had two twin rooms, the one i stayed in was quite small but was clean and tidy. Breakfast room and Bedrooms did get warm but this was because Air Conditioning is not working - when its back up and running it should be better.Breakfast was fine, no complaints from any of us. Had no problems with staff, we left our luggage at hotel until we could check in and left it there after we checked out .The location is great , just a few minutes walk from Central Station and to Dam Square.We would go back again.

<Content>Repeat Visitor Can't REcommend Enough I have now stayed at this Hotel 6 times in the past two years and cannot say enough about it for what it is. For a 3 star hotel and its price, it is amazing. The location is the finest for Amsterdam.I typically take the train from the airport at 3.60 euros one way and save a very expensive cab fare. Cross the street from the station and 2.5 blocks and you're at the front door. Dutch blocks are about 50 feet long, so it's a breeze. Ditto for return or early a.m. departures to airport.Rooms, expecially singles are small. Singles are really tiny, but my rooms have always been fanatically clean. I took my sister for her birthday from NYC and another time with a friend and a couple trips by myself. Breakfast is an adequate array of simple foods and a bit more choices than some others on the european plan. WIndows that open, the price, always hot water, very clean and the location can't be beaten. I'm even going again in Jan/Feb with friends who are meeting me there . They just installed new air conditioning which should be up and running in the spring. It can get too hot from the heat in the winter, but all over eurpoe this is the norm and baffles us Americans, especially when they [-] about the fuel cost, yet leave the shop doors open all day and nite too. I stay here every chance I get. Tram is out front, restaurants, coffee houses, bars within 150 feet. Humphreys has a prix fix menu on the tiny sq. next door at about 21 euros with 3 courses and is pretty good, certainly better than standard tourist restaurants and some dutch dishes, cheeses and desserts. Also Hjaes Claes on Spui and ten blocks or so down has exceppent dutch food choices and the locals go there too. Been there several times and it is great. Double check the spelling on that. Also American Cafe at American Hotel on Leidseplein has a fine cafe/bistro menu, extremely well done, seasonal specialties, but pretty expensive. Yet they deliver and beat the tourist crap at the tourist places.For the people who [-], pay twice as much at am American name chain and be dissappointed. They'll never beat the location, cleanliness, free internet or anything else I can imagine. I've tried those and feel deflated, expecially over the money and they want 15 -29 euros for the same breakfast.

<Content>Wouldn't stay here again I stayed in Avenue Hotel at the end of July for only one night as I had to switch planes coming back home to Toronto. I found this hotel over the Internet and looked at the hotel site before booking. I decided to go with Avenue because it was very close to the Central station and it offered an early morning shuttle bus service to the airport for 12 euros which was very convenient. However, once I got there I realized the website and the lobby of the hotel were very deceiving. The room I stayed in was very poorly kept. The carpet was dirty, the bed small and uncomfortable and didn't look very clean. It was very hot, the AC wasn't working and I had to keep the window open all night just to get some air in. I wasn't too happy with the bathroom either. Comparing to the other hotels I've stayed in Europe, it was quite dirty. Also, another warning: The walls are VERY thin and the noise is unbearable. The people next door were not talking very loudly, but it felt like they were sitting in the room with me. Horrible!I wouldn't recommend this hotel as there are other much better hotels in Amsterdam for the same price.The only good thing about Avenue that it is very close to the Central station (less than a 5 minute walk) and to the Dam Square.

<Content>AVOID ! pay a little extra for quality! I arrived at this hotel to be told check in was 2pm, it was now 1.30pm so I waited and waited, I was eventually allowed to check in at almost 3pm! The single rooms are so small like a broom cupboard; they have a shower with a hole in the bathroom floor, so every time you shower the whole en-suite room floods! When booking the hotel I requested a single room with a bath 4 months in advance, which I had stayed in before, I received no reply to this and my request was NOT honoured. Breakfast food was only warm and not worth bothering with, the hotel staff don鈥檛 seem to care very much about your comments. The only good point of this hotel is its location and it is cheaper than most. I would NOT stay again! My advice is to pay a little extra and have some comfort.

<Content>Recommended - again! This is my third visit to this hotel in the last 12 months and for those who aren't after luxuries associated with more expensive hotels, I can definitely recommend the Avenue.I stayed here for 3 nights in a single room on the top (6th) floor and had a peaceful sleep each night. Some traffic noise which is expected but no mosquitos, perfect. The room was small and basic but spotlessly clean and the walk in shower (no bath) was excellent. Breakfast was adequate with a selection of hot and cold food.As previously stated this hotel is in an excellent location. My main reason for this trip to Amsterdam was a Steve Lukather concert at the Paradiso (Leidseplein) which was a cheap 1.60 euro ride via trams 1, 2 or 5 which also go to the DAM, Flower Market etc.I would not hesitate to use this hotel again.

<Content>Very Poor My wife and I didn't actually book this hotel but the sister hotel down the road called the BelleVue- however on arrival at BelleVue we were advised our booking was cancelled and advised the 'Avenue Hotel' was of equal standard. So on arrival we found the staff on the reception at the Avenue Hotel very friendly and professional, however the rooms are quite frankly dire. The first room we had, two twin beds pushed together to make a double, both with several rips in the sheets on show, hairs on pillows on the bed, stench of something horride in the room, furniture and walls dented and dirty, dust all over the room, worn carpets stained- awful. Therefore requested another room, a little better however still not a double but twin beds together, nasty stains in the worn carpet next to the bed where some-one had clearly been sick at some point, dirty, dusty, and not fresh in anyway- bascially smelly used rooms. Not even a cheap hotel either. Breakfast is ok, we were just pleased to get out to the room! Expect breakfast to be a cramped affair, too many tables and people in one area, even the fire exit was blocked by a table. This hotel spolit our anniversary trip to Amsterdam and would NOT recommend it to anyone before it has an entire refit and good scrub!

<Content>Avenue was perfect! As a single female leisure traveller from India, I was concerned about booking good hotel rooms for myself when I travelled to some European cities. I found Avenue on Venere.com.....everything about it on the website coupled with the reviews on this site made me book a single room for myself for 2 nights in May 2008. On reaching Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, I very easily got myself onto the train that got me to Amsterdam Central in no time. As instructed very cleraly on the website, the hotel is just a 5 minute walk away from the station..which proved to be very convenient. The man at the reception was very friendly and welcomed me though I reached there as early asa 8:00am!!! I was requested to leave my bags in the luggage room and come back later in the afternoon. After going about the city in the canal bus (hop on hop off), I returned to the hotel later in the afternoon and was delighted with the single room I was given. It was on the 4th floor...had no view (but that's ok)....it was very comfortable, had a lovely bath and a bright cheerful feel to it. The location is perfect....all the places of interest are within walking distance. The breakfast which was included in the price was wonderful....breads, jellies, cereals, milk, juices, eggs, pancakes......didn't feel hungry until much later in the day after eating breakfast like a king!I enjoyed an Italian meal just across the road from the hotel...regret that I don't remember the name of the restaurant. All in all, I had a wonderful 2 night stay at Hotel Avenue before I left for Belgium and France. I would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone and would love to stay here again!

<Content>Avenue Hotel Amsterdam Me and 3 lads stayed at the Avenue Hotel from Fri 30th May 08 - Mon 2nd June 08. I booked a quad room (4 single beds). See their website for pictures as the photos of the rooms are as they say. The room itself was great. Only two small things that posed a problem. 1. There is a step before you enter the toilet. Not good when you are drunk! lol2. The ceiling frame is low at some points in the room, especially near the window. We bumped our heads several times. Takes getting used to.There is a safety deposit box for your money and passport. This is in the reception area. Just ask the receptionist for a key. Its 2,50 eur a day. If your flight is late and you have checked out of the hotel, there is a luggage room to leave your bags in so you can go shopping or get something to eat before the airport. This was great because we had booked our flight for 10pm on the monday night and all hotels check you out at 12am.A lot of people give the breakfast two thumbs up on this website. I disagree as we found the sausages to be uncooked and not eatable. The bacon was rawish (dutch style). You could get a bowl of cereal and some bread and orange juice but dont be expecting a massive selection. The breakfast is included in your price.We played loud music and had the craic in our room before we went out. We had no complaints which was great. Our view was of brick wall which didnt bother us at all.

<Content>Great little all-rounder! The Avenue Hotel was a great choice for a weekend break to Amsterdam. A train from Schiphol airport whisked us to Centraal Station in no time and ten mins walk had us at the Avenue Hotel, ideally located on Noord-Holland.The staff were friendly, courteous and all spoke English. When we had a problem with our original room - three rooms were under renovation on our floor - they quickly moved us to another room on a different floor. The breakfast buffet was outstanding - varied and expansive - and kept us going for a good part of the day. Most of the city's must-see destinations are within walking distance, including Dam Square, The Anne Frank House and the Red Light District. I was one of a hen party of 23 and we could not fault it for location, value for money and customer service. I would recommend it to anyone considering a trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Avenue is Fine We stayed in the Avenue for three nights Wed to Fri 9th to 12th April and found it to be very well located for Dam Square and Central Amsterdam. Only five to ten minutes walk from Central Station and there is a tram stop close to hotel for travel round rest of the city although much of the city is easily reached on foot.The hotel does a very good breakfast both Continental and British and lots of choices. Our room was on the 6th floor and was clean and tidy with two single beds pushed together to make a queensized bed. There was plenty of cupboard space and clothes hangers. The en-suite bathroom had a bath with an over-bath shower. Slightly difficult to get hot water to right temperature and would be difficult for an older person to get in and out. The room did not have air conditioning and was quite warm at night so I think it would be very hot in the summer and you would need the window open with the possibility of noise from outside. Apart from that the hotel was grand, staff were nice and friendly. Good hotel for short break in a lovely city.

<Content>Great Hotel!! Have just returned from a weekend staying at the Avenue Hotel. The Hotel was excellent for a 3* accomodation. The twin room was perfectly adequate with a lovely bathroom. We stayed in room 111 on the 1st floor, so there was a little noise from outside in the evening, but no noise from people walking to and from their rooms. Security was excellent as you needed your key card to access the lift to go to your room. Breakfast was included in the room price and was excellent - choice of cereals, cooked breakfast, continental and fruit. Nothing ever ran out and all the tables were kept clean.We would stay again xxxxxxx

<Content>Just so-so This hotel was somewhat disapointing. The room was small, but the bathroom was large for European standards and clean. The room had 1 small window that was too high to even see out of, so it made the room seem somewhat dungoness. The breakfast was ok, but I've had better. The staff tried to be helpful, but they were not very knowedgable about things we needed help with. The location of the hotel was convenient, being very close to the train station and there were a few restaurants close by. However, traveling with just another female friend, I did feel a little uneasy after dark.

<Content>Great location, excellent service and love the room My girlfriends and I stayed @ a quad room in this hotel. It was very roomy and the rest of my friends that stayed at their double rooms are happy with the hotel also. The location is excellent, its very close to the central station. Its at the borderline of red light district so we have the benefit of both world. It was quiet and yet we are in the middle of everything.The front desk people were GREAT!! They made our trip so much more pleasant after the hotel expereince in Paris. They are so much more friendly and very helpful. The front desk staff made some restaurant recommendations and we loved it!! Both the price and the quality of the food were excellent. The restaurants were right by their hotel too!I know they are currently undergoing some sort of constructions so the hotel will probably be even better! I would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic This hotel was everything we expected and more! Literally a few minutes walk to EVERYTHING in Amsterdam from Dam Square, to the red light district, to Anne Frank's House and of course central station. The room was small (but what rooms in Europe are'nt) but made the most of space. Was very clean, very comfortable and quiet. We had a room at the back, which did'nt have a view (honestly who cares it's where you sleep) but did have a small bathroom, but of course it did'nt bother us as it was spotlessly clean!Brekafast was more then adequate with a great spread to suit everybody. Staff were helpful and you could even leave your bags in the luggage room while you explore the city waiting until you could get into the room.Considering it's Amsterdam, the price was fair. Would reccommend this place to anyone and everyone.

<Content>great location, great value, would go back We just returned from 3 nights at this hotel. It is only a 5 minute walk from centraal train station and is right in the centre of Amsterdam. Our check in was very quick and efficient and the reception staff were courrteous and helpful throughout the stay.This hotel is great for a short break, it is spotlessly clean and the rooms are modern and comfortable.We paid about 拢75 per night and i think this was quite good value for bed and breakfast.It's difficult to get cheap beds in Amsterdam, so this was fine.I would recommend it and would definately return.It's no frills but pleasant and comfortable. I asked for a room at the back after reading other reviews and it was a little noisy at times during the night, but nothing to complain about.The standard/decor of room was similar to the standard of a travelodge/travel inn type place in UK.

<Content>Quality hotel for a good price The Avenue Hotel is rated between three and four stars, depending on where you look, but the more reputable websites seem to tend towrads giving it three stars. With this in mind, and my previous experience of so called three star hotels in Amsterdam, I wasn't expecting much.When I arrived in Amsterdam at Central Station, I was pleasantly suprised by ow close the hotel was, it was no more than a three minute walk from the front of the station. Easy to find too, as the building is a distinctive colour on that street. Upon entering, I was impressed by the reception, which was large, clean and tasteful. The friendly guy at the desk informed us that our room wouldn't be ready for an hour, which was slightly disappointing, but he pointed out the left luggage room for us, so we dropped our suitcases off and went to explore. When we came back, we were given our keycard very quickly, and pointed in the direction of the lift. Our room was on the fourth floor, but because of the lift this didn't matter. The room was not of a huge size, but did make good use of the space. The queen bed turned out to be two singles pushed together, but on the plus side that did mean it was bigger than the average double. The sheets were all very clean. There was a decent sized wardrobe, a huge desk/dressing mirror, a small TV, another large dressing mirror and plenty of lighting. The window was big, but the view was terrible, just of a brick wall. Good job we didn't plan to spend too much time in the room, and this did also mean that our room was very quiet. The bathroom was of a good size, with a lovely deep bath and nice clean towels. There were two shower heads, one on the wall and one attached to the bath, neither of which would maintain a constant temperature long enough for a comfortable shower, so we resorted to having baths instead.All in all, although there were a couple of small problems (the shower, the single beds and the view), none of these really seemed to matter, because the hotel was clean and spacious, quiet, and the staff were always willing to help. To top it all off, the hotel is in a fantastic location, just on the outside of the main pedestrianised shopping area, very close to the station and dam square, and not too far (or close!) to the red light district.

<Content>Great Location There was 7 of us who stayed at the Avenue Hotel, we found the hotel to be very central, clean and great for visiting the sites of Amsterdam. Our room was of average size, however the bathroom was pretty small. The down side of the room was that it overlooked the front of the hotel and it was very very noisy, also we had the hotel sign outside of the window which meant the room being very brigth even during the night with the blackout curtains drawn. The breakfast at the hotel is excellant with plenty of choice and variety. The hotel has a little bar which we used only the once. The hotel is really central, its an excellent location for the main shopping area and just a short walk from most of the interesting sites around Amsterdam. I would return to this hotel, however I wpould have to insist on a room at the back of the hotel (my fellow travellers had these and slept like a log) other than that its a great little hotel.

<Content>We would not return Having read some of the other comments, we were probably unlucky but all we can say is avoid room 305 if you can. We note there is actually a photograph of the room and the bathroom in the candid photos section! The room was small and the wardrobe and shelf (euphemistically called a desk) were made of white chipped melamine and there were stains on the carpet. The worst problem, however, was the bathroom. It was probably 6 ft. by 4 ft. square with a wet room type shower in one corner. Whenever the shower was used the whole of the bathroom flooor became wet - the water lapped around the base of the toilet (horribly unhygienic) and soaked the bathmat which had been mistakenly placed on the floor. For safety reasons we had to wait until the floor dried before using the electric hairdrier fixed to the bathroom wall and obviously the toilet and washbasin could not be used until the floor dried out. The breakfast was at best adequate. The hot food was never hot - the eggs were not scrambled but baked in a casserole and then cut up! We did not expect luxury at a three star which was relatively inexpensive but the bathroom problem was certainly unacceptable and we made the situation known to the receptionist on checking out.

<Content>City Convenience we stayed here as a lay over on our way home. The avenue is about a ten minute walk from the station and allowed us to leave our luggage all day so that we could go round the city long before we could check in. It is within 5 minutes of Dam square and really well placed on one of the main tram routes. The rooms were small but clean and all of the staff really friendly. bar prices were very reasonable for a hotel.

<Content>Hate it afterall I m writing after a very long time that I stayed in this hotel but It happen to hear from some friends that they are planning to stay there and then i remember my terrible experience there, so I feel i have to warn some people.The thing is that we had been stolen in this hotel (our room and two others at the same floor) and the staff was really rude.The exact words of the manager were that they are not responsible for that and they blamed us for not using the safe ! I happen to work in the past for a travel agency in Greece and the customers got refunds for almost everything.I didnt expect that but I was waiting at least for staff that look it cares.I never thought that the cosmetics and sunglasses that i bought are things to put in the safe! But we were lucky compare to the other two rooms which they lose a lot of money( 2000 euros the spanish couple and cameras etc..the japanese couple).But the thing was that we felt unsafe then and that destroyed the very good times we had in Ams.Our room was like a cabin of a ship ( really small ,noisy,smelly, with no view and a bathroom without bath -just a shower that every time we use it was a disaster the bath was wet and slippery allover)I happen to travel a lot and the first thing i can tell is that if the rates were lower and the steal thing was in my dreams i wouldnt compain about the room!!The only good thing that I can say is that is really in the centre of the city!!!!

<Content>Overpriced and dreary I would not recommend this hotel. The hotel really needs a refurb.I stayed in the quad room with my husband and two children. All beds are singles and the room was very smelly and dusty. Also very noisy to the front. The beds were small and uncomfy and the towels almost threadbare and had the filthiest carpet I have seen. If it was half the price, I'd think it was fair, but overall it was really bad value. True it is central but not a nice area for families. Ideal for a stag night perhaps. Shame because the the room itself could have had character. Also lots of dodgy guys in the hotel and the luggage room has a stack of x-rated movies piled up, just at the right height for an 8 year old.Also, beware families, my daughter fell down the stepladder and broke her arm. Reception were not rude, but really didn't care. We had just completed a wonderful cycling holiday (Cycletours) and the Avenue experience really spoilt it for us.Don't understand why other reviewers say the lobby is nice. I travel a lot and it is a very very average.Regret wasting my money on this hotel. You can defintely do better.

It's within walking distance to most everythig, very central, but not in an area that's overly crammed with tourists.You can get where you're going, but it was nice to be able to return to the hotel being in a calmer area. Of course there's plenty of shopping, cafes and restaurants a block or two away.We had a room with a window that opened up into a central air shaft type void above the breakfast area. It was necessary in the summer to have the window open or else you'd melt, but with the window open you got to hear crying babies, drunk people yelling into their mobile phones at the window and all the while smoke wafting into your room from others. Overall the place was clean, the rooms were alright, the location was great but it was difficult to sleep at times.

<Content>Nice location, staff not nice. Avenue Hotel is in a great location and the lobby looks very nice. The staff is extremely rude if you want to ask them a question. They act like you are bothering them. The room have a very small bathroom and NO air conditioner. If you go in the summer, you should ask for a fan at the front desk. I have been to Amsterdam on several times, but I will never stay at the Avenue Hotel again!

<Content>Love the Avenue- great bargain, great location This review is a little dated- i stayed at the Avenue Hotel in April of 2005...After a long search for the right hotel, I decided to book the Avenue Hotel for a 5 night stay in Amsterdam. I have been to the city previously, but stayed in a hotel far outside the central district. This time around i was looking to be closer to the action.The Avenue offered very reasonable rates in a good location. This is the perfect hotel for those looking to see Amsterdam on a budget, but do not want to deal with the hostels. it's a clean, modern hotel in a good spot. If you're looking for a 4 star luxury hotel, this isnt your place.A short walk from the train station, the hotel is in a central spot for walking the city. Restaurants, bars, cafes, museums and shops are all within walking distance.. we had no need for trains or cabs for our entire stay.The rooms are typically European - clean, but very small. Our bed was at best a double size (definitely not a queen) but my girlfriend and i got used to sleeping in it after a night. The bathroom was modern, and the room was kept very clean by staff. We had no issues with any noise- but since we were in the back of the hotel, i cannot comment on the front rooms.The included breakfast buffet standard, and a good way to save a few $$$.. the typical scones, muffins, eggs, teas and coffees were offered... if you get tired of the same old, try one of the breakfast cafes on the block.. there's one right up the road run by a woman from Seattle.. she was friendly and the food was great.The hotel also features a small lounge/bar area with internet connection. You have to buy internet access to use the computer. The connection (as of 2005) was very slow, and generally not worth using if you could avoid it. The bar area was generally not crowded, and closed before midnight every night. Overall, I was extremely happy with my choice of the Avenue.I wasn't staying in Amsterdam to hangout in my hotel, so all i wanted was location, value, and cleanliness. With the Avenue, you go 3 for 3.

<Content>Well-run Hotel near Everything I booked at the Avenue because of its location near the train station and a particular business location (trip was a mix of business and vacation), While it's quite near the train station, in a busy area, and near the 'red light' district, I found it to be very nice and professionally run. (However, I did walk around the red light district to get to my place of business.) I would recommend it. I didn't find it to be noisy at all, despite it's location, though I think this could be an issue on some nights. The room was quite large for Europe, with a full bathtub. The breakfast was great. The staff is well trained and helpful without acting like they're your new best friends (that overly friendly American way so popular in the hospitality industry).

<Content>excellent location, a little dreary We stayed at the Avenue for 2 nights. The room was rather small but with a good size bathroom. Very dark as very little natural light and no main light in the room. Bed was very comfy. The hotel was in a great location a few minutes walk from the Centraal Station. most things in walking distance. Receptionists were very aloof and quite unfriendly. I would imagine them to be very at home in a 5 star ultra luxury hotel, as they walked around with their noses in the air! All in all a good stay and the breakfast was OK too.

<Content>very noisy in the front I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews, and had asked for a room at the back. When we got there, the hotel was full and the room we were given was overlooking the street, and super noisy. Despite the noise and mosquitoes, closing the window was not an option, since there is no air conditioning.And the breakfast--eh. If you want to eat piles of cheese and cold cuts, it would be okay. I would have preferred more breads and pastries.

<Content>fab rooms, ace location, smashing holiday Well what can I say , it had been many years since I had visited amsterdam so I was very keen to make sure that all elements of the holiday went well.The location is ideal for the central, station, dam square, a cafe is located across the roads numerous shops nearby and also the tram stops. There is no need to get on the tram from central station to the hotel just walk. (it took me and my partner 5 mins ) he was carrying the case though....... The room that we had was huge and cleaned daily. I had no issue at all with the accomodation the staff are very friendly. The sweets on the reception are even better . My only gripe was the breakfast !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! did not enjoy at all , it is still edible but it just was not worth waking up for in the morning.There is a wide selection to choose from but i mainly stuck to doing myself sandwichs with the wide selection of cheese and ham you got .All in all fantastic. This is a hotel that i would def use again.

<Content>fab location My partner and I have just come back from a 5 night stay at Avenue Hotel. The room was basic but comfortable with all we needed as a base, the room was very clean which is always a plus. The only downside was that we had nothing at all to look at out the window but who goes to Amsterdam to stay in their room!We made it to breakfast a couple times it was good plenty of choice of hot and cold options lots of coffee, tea and fresh fruit juice.The location of this hotel is spot on with it being close enough to all sights etc but also far enough away so it wasnt too noisy. We really enjoyed our time in Amsterdam and would definatly stay at Avenue Hotel again.

<Content>Very happy here We (my wife and I) wanted somewhere to stay for 4 days for my 60th birthday. The Avenue was recommended by a local travel agent, so I checked out the comments on Tripadvisor then returned and booked it.Staff were very friendly, polite and helpful with queries and questions. The Hotel is owned by a group which has other Amsterdam Hotels also and whilst there is no restaurant on site, a complimentary ticket for one in one of their other nearby hotels (2 minutes walk towards the Railway Station away), giving a ten percent discount on meals, is part of the welcome pack in the rooms.There is a bar on site open 5pm to midnight daily where we were able to buy Bombay Sapphire gin and bottles of tonic, a double cost 10 Euros (for her indoors, who didn't want to try the local gin - Jenever). Pizzas can be ordered in the bar but as the streets all around are brimming with cafes, take aways, restaurants etc, we didn't try this service. I settled for a medium glass of Heineken at 2.50 Euros!My travel agent told us that only Continental breakfasts were served in the hotel. Continental breakfasts have changed since I was a lad! This used to mean a croissant and a cup of coffee but breakfast catered for all nationalities with a help yourself choice of: 4 cereals, fruits in syrup, a great bowl of yoghurt, croissants, hard boiled eggs, hot scrambled eggs, bacon, beans, frankfurter sausages, tomatoes, a choice of salads and cold meats, grapefruit juice, orange juice, cold milk, piping hot coffee, hot milk, tea, marmalades, jams, bread rolls etc etc. We ate until full and didn't need to eat again until evening, and we used up a lot of energy walking all over the city! There is enough food at breakfast to make up packed lunches if you so desired without denting the constantly re-filled dish quantities.The only negative I could give was that one of the two showers (yes, TWO) over the bath was badly set so her indoors flooded the bathroom floor in spite of having pulled the curtain round as far as possible, (AND tucked it inside the bath) and soaked the floor towel rather extensively!Another small problem we encountered was that we struggled to turn the lights on in our room and to re-open the door once we'd got in until I figured out that the credit card key had to be put in to a small slot alongside the light switches by the door, after which everything worked fine. (We'd not come across this system before).

<Content>Nice hotel, good location Stayed at this hotel for one night. Attractive reception area, helpful staff. Rooms compact, but clean, comfortable and adequate for a short stay. Good hot and cold buffet breakfast, filled us up for the day. Good location, easily walkable from Centraal Station, (about 10 minutes) and is a short walk to Dam Square and the main shopping streets. Anne Frank House is approx 15 minute walk. Lots of eateries and bars close by. Bathrooms are more like a wet room with shower curtain, so you do have to watch where you put the bath mat and your clothes. The floors are dipped so the water runs away, so not a problem. Only one fault - our room was at the back, close to air conditioning vents and as I am a light sleeper I woke up a couple of times with the noise (which my husband didn't notice), so make sure your room is away from that unless you are a heavy sleeper (or a teenager!). Probably would not have noticed it had we stayed longer.My son had a room at the side of the hotel, nearer the street. Some traffic noise, depends if you like your window open at night.

<Content>Clean, well located, well priced I have stayed at this hotel on 3 occasions in the past 12 months and have had a different room each time. The rooms at the top of the hotel are the best, with views over the city rooftops. All rooms are clean and newly decorated, if a little small but that is typical for Amsterdam. The location is good - only 5 minutes walk from the central station, and close to the main attractions such as the Jordan.Prices are about average for Amsterdam, but I have stayed in worse hotels in the city for the same price. Breakfast is OK, but there are numerous cafe's nearby.

<Content>Excellent hotel We must have chosen the coldest days in March for a break at The Avenue. Despite the weather we enjoyed our stay. The hotel is very convenient for all the sights and transport , being a short walk from the station and the canal bus.The hotel was friendly and very clean and comfortable. The breakfast's were just great with lots of choice. The room was always very warm which we were very grateful for as it was so cold outside. We would definately go back there when we visit Amsterdam again. I left a small item of clothing in the room and they returned this to me without any problems. Thank-you The Avenue

<Content>excellent hotel!!! we stayed at the avenue for 5 nghts in march,and we were really pleased when we arrived,it was cosy and welcoming,and the staff really helpful on reception. having made it to our room (we are both smokers and requested a smoking room)were really pleased that our room was clean and tidy,and even though a smoking room not stinky at all.the room was adequate for 2 people,as we only used it for a base.it was very cold and windy the whole time we stayed in dam,and found the room a bit chilly at times,but hey,a good excuse to snuggle up!! we were amazed that we didnt hear any noise(at all) in rooms,really solid walls. if you like a morning cuppa remember a travel kettle,but its not a huge problem as there is a douwe egberts coffee/tea machine in the lobby.breakfast was good,you could really fill up with cereals,the usual hotel streaky bacon,srambled eggs and beans etc,then have bread/rolls with jam etc. we had a late breakfast one morning and even thogh it was edible,could have been a bit hotter,but not a problem either as there were plenty of other things on offer. overall a thoroughly enjoyable stay,and will definately stay here again,(just not for a while,need some time to recover!!!) really good situation too,10mins from centraal station ,and 10 mins to dam sq,depending on how many coffeeshops you pass along the way!!perfect!!

<Content>Avenue Hotel, Amsterdam We were a bit apprehensive as we arrived at the Avenue last week, after reading some of the reviews, but we needn't have worried. I'd asked for a quieter back room, which we were allocated. Our room was spotless and larger than a lot of others that I've stayed in. The breakfast was more than adequate and the staff polite. The location of the hotel was spot on, only a couple of minutes walk from the railway station. We walked everywhere (the fantastic weather allowed us to wander). We would definately use this one again.

<Content>Great location After booking this hotel before reading other reviews we were a little apprehensive but need not have been! This is a lovely hotel for a weekend break. You can walk to anywhere in old Amsterdam from this hotel, but it is not in the noisiest/busiest of areas.The hotel is clean and the staff friendly and helpful. We had a quiet room at the back of the hotel. It was compact but had all we needed (especially as we took our travel kettle!). The bathroom (about which we had heard so much!!) is a wet room - perfectly acceptable in modern hotels and spotlessly clean.Safety deposit boxes can be hired in the lobby for 2.50 euros per day. Breakfast is plentiful and varied. We'd certainly recommend it to others.

<Content>Avenue Hotel, Amsterdam Stayed at the Avenue hotel in February. Hotel rooms were a little on the small side BUT had everything you wanted in them for a short stay. Good powerful showers! Comfortable beds! only no coffee/tea in rooms!! Breakfasts were good, lots to choose from so you need not go hungry. Really central to Dam Square and within walking distance of Anne Franks House. Check out the cake shop down the road towards dam square. OPen to 4am! Amazing and great after a night out!! All staff friendly and polite in hotel. Great place to stay.

<Content>Costly mistake I paid for a round-trip shuttle from and to the airport. When I checked into the hotel, I told the clerk to make a 10:00 AM reservation for me on the shuttle the next morning. She told me that she did so, but she did NOT. The next morning when this was discovered, I had to order a taxi to get to the airport on time, which cost me about $50, and the hotel would only reimburse me the cost of half the shuttle ticket (9.5 euros).

<Content>Only Average Have just returned from spending the weekend (2 nights - Fri  Sat ) at the Avenue Hotel. It was a cold, wet night when we finally arrived at 11.45pm after a delayed flight to Schipol. Being close to Centraal Station the hotel is a short walk. Our twin room ( I was sharing with a girlfriend) was on the 3rd floor at the end of a long twisting corridor.I had emailed the hotel direct a few days previously and asked for a quiet non smoking room - which we got. The 3rd floor is completely non smoking.The room was small - the 2 single beds were pushed together and no room to separate them - so make sure you share with a good friend. One pillow and a duvet for each bed was provided. There is a TV (which we didnt use) and very limited storage space - just a small wardrobe with 2 shelves, not great if staying for longer than a couple of days! The radiator was off when we arrived but gave us enough warmth when we wanted it  to dry our towels.The bathroom had a shower, wc  wash basin. The shower was a problem as mentioned in previous reviews. The floor is on one level with just a curtain rail in the ceiling around the shower head, from which the shower curtain hangs. The shower head is fixed and when the shower is on (its very powerful) the water sprays through the gap in the side of the curtains and soaks anything on the washbasin's side. The floor is like a lake as the water doesnt drain away as fast as is necessary, so on stepping out of the shower the bathmat is saturated. Whoever designs this had NOT thought it through!BUT still..... we managed, although we didnt spend long getting clean!I have to mention the low level of lighting in the room too, which was very frustrating when trying to read  unpack in the smi darkness - we made an attempt at removing a lampshade from a bedside light but couldnt budge it!Breakfast was good - as mentioned by previous reviewers, cereals,juices (not fresh squeezed) fruit salad (though tinned) plain yogurt, cold meats, cheese, tomatoes, cucumber, assorted rolls and bread. There was a hot choice too, bacon, baked beans, rather solid scrambled eggs, sausages (frankfurters) small pancakes (which looked rather like ravioli) and boiled eggs. Coffee was provided in large hot jugs and was very weak! Tea bags and hot water was available too.You could easily fill up before you went out to see the sights.We found the reception desk staff helpful with advice on trams and tickets. We didnt try the small bar at the hotel.We had prebooked by email, a retaurant off Dam square called Brasserie Harkema - I would recommend it for a great meal in a buzzy atmosphere. Its housed in a converted tobacco factory and has an excellent if short menu. price for 3 courses and a good bottle of wine 拢56 with service.We saw all the sights - Van Gogh museum, Anne Frank House and did a canal boal trip - catch it from outside Centraal Sation. Love Amsterdam - my 6th trip and my friends first - we will be back and despite the niggles think that the Avenue Hotel is good value  in an ideal position to see everything - a tram stop virtually outside the door helps. Might upgrade to a superior twin next time though - just to get better lighting and more space!

<Content>2nd time and Avenue! We stayed for New year last year in the Avenue hotel and again for new year this year, cant really go wrong, 5 mins walk from all attrations - great location. Rooms are basic but warm, comfy and clean just what you need (apart from a fridge).Quality breakfast choices, hot and cold (cereal, bread, jams, american style meat, salad, sausage, bacon, scrambled egg etc) the one downfall they do not do toast i asked but they said no! We also requested a room again at the back of the hotel so the trams do not wake us up early. - Always a good idea.Hotel staff friendly reception is open 24 hours, easy check in we left our luggage in locked room as we were 4 hours early and an easy check out, again left luggage in room flight not till tea time - PERFECT.I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel.Clare

<Content>5 nights at the Avenue Our previous stay at the Avenue was about 6 years ago. At that time the rooms although clean, were in need of an upgrade, and the breakfast room was very small. We were surprised at the transformation this time of the whole hotel. A much larger reception area, luggage room, and security room. We were on the 4th floor at the side next to the lift. There was very little street noise. Our room was very spacious with two large beds pushed together making it bigger than king-size, a new bathroom with bath/shower combined,wc  washbasin. Free toiletries were supplied everyday, towels replaced on request. The breakfast room was much larger and towards the rear of the hotel. As much as you can eat of cereals(5), cold meats(3), cheese(2),hot bacon,sausage, beans,eggs(boiledscrambled), mini pancakes.Assorted breads  rolls,preserves,fresh fruit,fruit juices and hot drinks. The staff were very friendly  helpful. We would not hesitate to return to this hotel

<Content>Noisy and sleep disturbed I stayed here in June 2006, we had an early flight from Stansted, Amsterdam Central station is only a short walk from the hotel which is good, we were not able to have our pre-booked room untill 2pm, although the next morning (Saturday) I was woken up before 9am by cleaners in the adjacent room bumping around and using vacuum cleaners, My room shared the same wooden floor joists as the adjacent room so every step that someone next door made was felt.Noise and vibrations from trams was incredible, they go through the foundations, Trams finish around 1am and start about 6am, so if you want to relax and have proper a nights sleep this is not the right hotel for you.The breakfast room is too small for the size of hotel and has overflow tables in the corridor.I wont be using this hotel again.

<Content>Good location We checked in at 9.30 am on Saturday, November 4. Room not ready as expected. To fill in time we did a canal cruise. Room was ready after 2 pm. Very basic/no frills/standard room WITH BATH. Very difficult to get out of the room door, just as well no emergency exit required. Reported to front desk for reporting to housekeeping. Still difficult. As you know this Hotel serves 'hot' breakfast only. For our 2 breakfast mornings, we were first into the room. Only hot food was hard boiled egg. The other items were not hot (are they ever?). No prunes, bircher muesli. NO TOASTER. On the Sunday we did a tour and when back at about 3 pm our room still not cleaned. Back downstairs to wait for the housemaid to do room. Left husband resting in the lobby whilst I went for a sightseeing walk. After 4 pm room done and we discovered that milk and soft drink we had placed in an 'ice bucket' on a bench had been removed. Advised reception who told me to let housekeeping know the next morning. Very difficult to obtain ice (they have no ice machine and will only provide a small glass full of ice - we used the rubbish bin as ice bucket). We booked a shuttle to the Airport through the hotel which was handled efficiently. The hotel 'takes all credit cards' but apparently not Amex. We liked the security door system. The bed was a small double with the usual doona/duvet. We had to have window open (noisy Saturday night) and feet/arms out from cover and still too hot to sleep. Also we both had bad problems after 2 nights. Actually when we arrived in Singapore (via Heathrow) we were taken off the 'plane in wheelchairs. Hotel in Singapore had an excellent massage chair which helped a lot in our recovery (will do separate review)

<Content>Better than we expected After reading some reports we were unsure of what to expect. We arrived to a very friendly greeting. I had written to ask for a quiet room and was given one on the side but this had been upgraded from a standard twin and was roomy, warm,comfy, spotless and had a well equipped bathroom with a powerful overbath shower and piping hot water. We could still hear the trams and a little street noise but carry ear plugs which dealt with that. The breakfast room is pretty and the food varied and enjoyable. My husband, given to such ways of passing the time noticed that every single light bulb was working in the public areas and there are many. We made use of the safe deposit facility and the suitcase storage as our flight was not till evening on our last day.The dish of love heart sweets on the recepetion were fun too and without exception the staff were pleasant and helpful-and to think I nearly changed my booking.

<Content>A Break from the Kids October 13th, our 2nd weekend away from the kids in 11 years. On the whole NOT BAD! Enjoyed Amsterdam.Stayed at The Avenue Hotel, great location, walking distance to Central Station. Not too noisy, except for the bell chimes every hour with a rendition of Onward Christian Soldiers. Hotel a bit quirky, but staff friendly and helpful, though no plug in bathroom sink, why? don't know, and shower not very good. Rooms are quite small but adequate. All you can eat for breakfast if you really want it after a hangover, fry ups, traditional cheeses, hams, rolls, fruit etc., Sent boyfriend down to bar for refreshments but bar closes at midnight. If you are into smoking it's a paradise for you, offered to you constantly, and the sex scene is certainly an eye opener. The live shows and cinemas are more of a laugh than anything, but do go with an open mind.Lin, Solihull

<Content>As european hotels go.....a little gem Having booked this hotel priopr to reading any reviews, was a little bit anxious. So much so we specifically requested a quiet room on the upper floors which they kindly arranged. If you go to city hotels in europe common sence dictates that unless you are willing to pay big money, basically you get what you pay for. However, we found the Avenue to be clean, friendly, great location, excellent breakfast as much as you can eat which really sets you up for the day. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly as were the staff. Yes the rooms were on the small size, but fully equiped. On the main it was no more noisey than any other holiday hotel. Guide me to a holiday hotel where you cannot hear late night revelers returning from a night out! The location was great for all the things that has to been seen and close enough to call back in in the afternoon for a quick refresh and rest. The hotel would benefit from tea and coffee making facilities but as seasoned travelers we never travel without our travel kettle! Easy location to get to from the station, so much so when we asked for a taxi, we were advised that we would be wasting our money! There were roadworks outside and no trams were running along the front of the hotel, which would no doubt add to background noise, but hey, it is a city hotel, in the heart of Amsterdam. If you want peace and quiet go to the country. Would I use it again, yes. It reflected value for money the clientiel were mixed. When we stayed there were no children staying or none that we seen.

<Content>VERY NOISY AND NO AIRCON!!!!!! We stayed at the Avenue Hotel from 17th to 21st July 2006 in a triple room and i must say i was a little disapointed at the overall hotel. We were put into a tiny room for 3 people right on the front street.....big mistake...VERY noisy....trams sound like they are coming through the room...like a mini eathquake every 5 mins and loads of noise from passing tourists all hours, the foldy out bed was broken in the room aswell. We asked to be moved next day and the staff were a bit off as they said that's what you should expect and it's only to 1am for the trams and they start back at 6am...so 5hours will do anyone wont it...lol. The new room was at the side of hotel (put us in a double superior which was larger than the triple) and was like stoner alley at night....more noise from stoners. Then there was the heat in the Rooms RED hot we had to sleep with wet towels on us to cool down, no air con apart from breakfast room.In conclusion here are the plus points and minus points to the hotel.....Plus Points:-Great LocationGreat BreakfastVery CleanOpposite an English Pub...lolNegative Points:-VERY NOISYNO AIRCON....Like a furnace in roomsStoner Alley to the side of hotelStaff very off if you make a complaint.Hope this helps....would have helped us....The renanisance looked really nice when i walked past by the way but never went inside so couldn't really comment.

<Content>Quiet, comfortable, and convenient! Just two days ago, I returned to Virginia from Amsterdam, where I spent 3 nights at the Avenue Hotel. After making my reservation and reading several Trip Advisor reviews, I was a bit concerned about streeet noise, surley staff, and other negatives. My room was on the back side of the hotel; I never heard street noise, trams, or more than some other guests whose windows were also open. Breakfast at the Avenue Hotel is an amazing array in the traditional Dutch style: cereals, breads, cheese and coldcuts, fruit, eggs, bacon, sausage, pankcakes, etc. The Avenue is one street away from the main tourist shopping area, and the main street from the Central Train Station. Trams to all parts of the city are a short distance from the hotel. Numerous restaurants are in the area of the hotel. The downside of the Avenue is the price, but it is competitive with other hotels of similar quality in the area.

<Content>Great location but very noisy and poor room lighting We stayed there for 4 nights in April.The first room we were given was below street level with the windows just above the pavement. We asked to be relocated higher up and were offered a twin room. Good Points:- Great Location from the train station/Dam Square etc- Great Breakfast - really good value.- Spacious room Bad Points:- The lighting was utterly poor. With all the light bulbs on,we could hardly see what we  were unpacking (no kidding!!) After complaining for nothing, we ended up purchasing 2  75watts bulbs to replace the 25 watt ones they had fitted. - Prepare for a lot of noise.The windows have no double glazing and though we were on  the side of the hotel one could still hear the tram and occasionally shouting of partygoers  at all times of the night.ConclusionUnless you are there to stay out the entire night and don't mind the noise don't go there

<Content>Loud Tram Noise Don't risk this hotel - although it's well situated there's a lots of noisey trams going past the window. They finish around 1.00am but start again at around 6.00am. There's no double glazing. The rooms at the back are OK but I wouldn't risk it!

<Content>Nice hotel, good location close to train station My husband and I stayed here for three nights in April. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the location is perfect being a five-minute walk to train station. Although close to the train station this hotel is not in a seedy area.Our room was the most spacious we had in the two weeks we were in Europe. The room was clean but all the chairs were badly stained and all could use a good cleaning.The breakfast room was large and cheerful. There was plenty to eat and something for everyone's taste. Do not, however, eat what looks like scrambled eggs. They are actually tofu, I think. They were pretty gross to say the least but all the other food was very tasty.I chose this hotel because it had an elevator which is somewhat hard to find in Amsterdam. The hotel lacked the old charm of Amsterdam being more an American-style hotel but my husband and I were pleased with the hotel and woud stay again.

<Content>Great Location Only a 5 minute walk from Central Train Station, this great little hotel is a gem in the centre of Amsterdam. Friendly and welcoming staff and a fantastic breakfast to set you up for the rest of your day.It's location is ideal for visiting most central locations on foot, though trams run past the hotel at frequent intervals.For example - 10 mins walk to Ann Franke Museum and the Jordaan region, 5 minutes to Dam Square and the Palace and Neuw Kerk museums (and Plaza Mayor shopping Mall). 10 minutes to the flower market, 20 minutes to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum.The only negative I would say is the late night noise of the trams going by. Other than that, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this gem to anyone

<Content>Bad expeience The location of the Hotel was good, it was close to the central station and the breakfast was good and there was plenty of food. With that in mind I would never stay at this hotel again. The beds and pillows were miserably uncomfortable and the front desk staff tried to overcharge us when we checked in and then tried to say that we didn't pay for the room as we were checking out. The staff finally beleived us when we showed them a payment receipt. There were a lot of other hotels that were nicer in the same location and for a cheaper price.

We have found on both occasions the staff to be very friendly and the rooms spotless. The breakfast was also good. If your looking to chill like the locals we recommend Bens coffeeshop just past the hotel, first street on the left.

<Content>Very Happy I was quite pleased with this hotel. Excellent location, walking distance to almost everything. We had a quad room with a good amount of space. 2 beds were in a loft upstairs, and with the windows and the loft you could really experience some of Amsterdam's unique architecture. I found good prices on the internet, but when I e-mailed the hotel with some questions, they beat the lowest internet price, saving me 90 euros a night from the original rate I found! The breakfast was good and easy. I felt the hotel was very safe and secure. Parking was easy in the lot underneath, costing 35 euros a day. I'll definitely stay there again!

<Content>Great Hotel! Dates of Stay: 9-11 December 2005Accommodation: Double RoomThis hotel is located within walking distance of Centraal Station (about 5 minutes) and is equally close to the Red Light District and shopping areas. Dam Square is about 10 minutes away and Leidseplein and Museumplein are all accessible by a single tram. Overall, the hotel was very comfortable with clean, well-maintained rooms. Breakfast was nothing special but we appreciated a little sustenance in the morning.Great value, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam for its cleanliness and ideal location!

<Content>Modern comfort in the world's coolest city I had a very good stay at the Avenue Hotel Nov 11-13 on a long weekend of fun and debauchery in A'dam.The hotel is in a great spot in the heart of the old center of Amsterdam, a short walk from Centraal Station. (Lugging bags and lazy, I took the tram two stops from Centraal to Niewezijds Kolk - the Avenue is to the left).The lobby is very nice with a nice bar/lounge up a half flight of steps. The staff was very courteous and professional, and I was able to check in immediately.The rooms aren't going to win any boutique-chic awards, but are very modern with all the necessary conveniences. (My single looked like a smaller version of a Courtyard by Marriott room.) The bed was very comfy, and space was adequate.The bathroom was a bit small, but not claustrophobic. Also, I would have appreciated a couple of more towels, but I think that's one of those wasteful American habits we could really afford to get over.The breakfast buffet included with the room rate was great - lots of pastries, cold cuts, fruit, juices, cereals, rolls, and even bacon, eggs and sausage. The coffee was excellent. (It seems hard to find bad coffee in Europe, unlike here!!)The location is superb. From the Niewezijds tram stop across from the hotel, trams go directly to the Leidseplein, Museumplein and Jordaan areas. Trams to the rest of the city can be accessed at Centraal.The hotel is a very short walk from Dam Square, the cheesily commercial Damrak and, of course, the Red Light District.Overall, a great stay in an incredible city.

<Content>Not impressed My husand  I had stayed in this hotel 2 years ago and had thought it was quite a good place to stay, however after our most recent stay we have changed our minds!Check in was fine  staff were friendly and we where given a nice clean  warm room, it was small but comfortable. The bathroom was tiny and we had problems while using the shower as water sprayed all over the bathroom floor when using the shower. It was rather old in decor but that is to be expected ion a hotel of this type ( after all it is an old warehouse conversion)At night is when the problems began! The fan in the bathroom whcih is supposed to come on  off with the lightswitch was broken so there was no way for us to turn off the fan  it ran continuosly.I called reception at around 10 om and the man at the desk was most unhelpful and had no interest in helping us. He did not offer another room  said as he was the only staff member left he could not leave the front desk in case other guests needed to be let into the hotel. He then said that we would have to wait until morning. I explained that we were having a hard time falling asleep due to the noise. ( it was very loud and right next to us as the room was tiny  even if we shut the door we could still hear it. I have read other peoples posts complaining about the trams going by and the noise of the clock tower but this did not bother us one bit compared to the humming of the fan.Breakfast was good and plentiful.After breakfast we went to reception to mention the fan again and the lady at the desk said that she would have someone look at it that day  it would be sorted. However when we retunrned later that day the fan was still running and we had to endure yet another night of it!A good point about the hotel is the location to the city as well as the Train station.The lack of caring shown by the staff has really put us off the Avenue Hotel. It seems as though they just ignore their guests and are clearly bothered by them.We will not be returning to stay there.

<Content>Good safe choice. Having stayed in about 30 hotels in this category in Amsterdam I would rate it as above average and good value for money. It is convenient for the station and therefore it is a lively area although not my favourite part of Amsterdam. My room was a very small but well furnished single with a similar bathroom. On previous visits , having booked singles ,I have been given small double rooms all of which have been satisfactory.Breakfast is reasonable (scrambled eggs in Holland are usually dreadful) but the breakfast room is rather uninspiring.All in all this is a good safe choice.It is not the best 3 star hotel in Amsterdam but it is better than most.

<Content>Excellent location The Avenue Hotel is ideally located for all Amsterdam's usual attractions. This was my first visit to Amsterdam and didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised with the Avenue Hotel. The room was spotlessly clean and adequate for a 3nt stay. The breakfast included in your rate was excellent and replenished on a regular basis. The staff at the hotel could not be faulted. Very friendly and helpful.I would certainly recommend this hotel and if I go back to Amsterdam, I would book the Avenue Hotel again.

<Content>Don't be put off! By the lacklustre reviews on this site. We stayed in a triple room for two nights. Yes the trams are noisy, but just take earplugs! The hotel is clean, efficient and we found the staff very helpful and polite (suitcase storage meant we could relax and enjoy our first and last full days). The breakfast is fab, but do get down before 10 am to make sure you get your hands on some of the yummy pancakes! It's an absolutely brilliant location, just 10 minutes walk from the station and on the right side of town. The train from the airport is really easy to catch and very quick and the hotel is just 10 minutes walk away from the station on the other side of the canal. We used the hop on hop off canal bus, which was cheap (given that you can use it for a full day then up to 12pm the following day). Book and catch the canal bus from outside the station. Do visit the Rijksmuseum (I'm no art buff, but it's still worth a visit) and the Anne Frank house (you may have to queue but not for too long and it's well worth the very reasonable entrance fee). Finally we recommend a tapas bar called La Gusta on the same road as the hotel - fantastic food, lovely authentic and friendly environment and excellent service! Enjoy!

<Content>average hotel, but the location is great Since I already know what to expect from a hotel for 110 Euro per night in Amsterdam, I wasn't dissapointed by the small room, tiny bathroom, lack of air condition, very small double bed. The room was clean, except one chair that had bad stains on the seat. The breakfast was weak, at least for european standards. The location is really great though, you're just one block off Damstrat and there's a tram outside the door. The guy at the front desk told us, that the whole hotel only has 5 double rooms so switching rooms for a couple is not that easy, especially on the week-end. PS: We had no! mice in our room!!!

<Content>Location: good; everything else: not so good We also chose this hotel based on the reviews here, but were quite disappointed overall. The first room we were given, which was not ready when we were told it was, was tiny, with little room to navigate around the hard, no top sheet, mattress. For our remaining 3 nights, we asked to be moved to a larger room, though one that would still be quiet as we are light sleepers. We were moved to a room of the same size, though now instead of having 2 twin beds pushed together, we had a smaller, double bed. The room was only larger in that the bathroom was about the same size as the room and now had a tub instead of a shower curtained area in which to bathe. The room was directly across from the housekeeping supply closets and near the elevator, so though we didn't get much tram noise, we got all kinds of other noise. There was no screen in the window, which overlooked a shaft that opened onto hallway windows, so we were eaten up by mosquitos. The staff were perfunctory, though I'd hardly call them friendly. The buffet was merely edible, so we skipped it after the first morning, stopping at one of several croissanteries instead. As it was high season, the city was overrun with crowds, so low season might be a better time to visit. Did love Toscanini in the Jordaan for dinner, O'Reilly's Pub near Dam Square, and Cafe de Piip for lunches. Great food at all three.

<Content>Great hotel, great location. My husband and I were very happy with this hotel. It is located in the heart of the city, near one of the main shopping streets and only a few blocks from Dam Square. In addition, if you need to get anywhere, it is less than a block from the tram and a few blocks from the Central Train Station.The room was small but comfortable. The bathroom looked as if it were recently renovated and was beautiful. It had a big clean tub.Our room was over the street and there was significant street noise. The trams were quite loud, as were the numerous people on the street. Luckily, we are not light sleepers.The breakfast included cereal, breads, croissants, coffee, juice, sausage, and small pancakes. It was delicious!We were very happy with this hotel and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Beware of mice in your room !! I chose Hotel Avenue based on reviews posted on this site and booked a quad room for our familly of two adults and two young children.I had emailed several weeks in advance notifying the hotel that we would need to check in a couple of hours earlier than standard time and was told that this would be fine. Upon our arrival I was told that our room was not ready and that it would be another two or three hours before our room became available. I stored our luggaage at the hotel and we went out site seeing for three hours. When we came back we were told that our room is ready. Once we entered the room, we found out that room was not cleaned yet, bed was un-made and there were towels and trash on the bathroom floor. Once again we came out to the lobby and waited for about an hour for the room to be cleaned. By this time it was about 4:00 PM and my 6 years old was pretty frustrated. After a quick shower we went out for dinner and decided to call it the night so the kids could rest. My 9 year old was watching TV and we were all dosing off when my son woke me to tell me he saw a mouse in the room. It may have been the exhaustion or lack of sleep that made me tell him that he was imagining thigs and I made him go to bed. The following night we came back to our room with some left over food in paper bags and fell asleep right away. My wife awoke to the sound of mice, yes several mice!. trying to get into the paper bags. At two in the morning I got dressed and went down to notify the gentleman at the reception.I was told that the hotel was completly booked up and the manager would be in at 9:00 and there was nothing he could do about the situation.Needless to say, this made for an interesting evening. At 6:00 I went out walked around and found us a room at the Renaissance hotel, a 5 star hotel, two blocks away for less than what we were charged at the Avenue. We checked out at 8:00 in the morning. At the check out time the hotel manager first tried to charge me for the entire amount for two nights, then offered a discount. But I was firm about paying only for the first night. Hotel Renaissance was wonderful, their personnel were extremely helpfull and we ended up having a wonderful time in Amsterdam.For those interested, Rijksmuseum is under construction, and more that 2/3 of the art work is not available. Canal Bikes are wonderful for kids and the floating flower market is beautiful in the morning. Have a great time in Amsterdam.

<Content>Super hotel in the heart of Amsterdam... We stayed at the Avenue Hotel in Amsterdam on April 2-4, 2005. The hotel is very close to the train station - you just turn right at the big Victoria hotel and take your next left at the major road, which is the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal, and the hotel is about 3 blocks on your left, just beside the Crown Plaza. Note: when taking the train from the airport to Centraal Station, buy your tickets from a person. The machines are only in Dutch and do not take credit cards, only Dutch debit cards. We requested a room at the back, having heard the trams are noisy (they are), and that worked out well. Pros of the room: decent size, lots of wardrobe/desk space, 2 English channels on the TV, quiet, super location. Cons: no AC (didn't need it in April but could imagine it would get hot in the summer), non-smoking rooms are right next to smoking rooms so we kept getting wafts of smoke (had to stuff towels against crack under door), sheets consisted of a duvet thing which was hot, and as there was no separate sheet, you just had to either use the duvet or do without, and also there is this giant clock in Dam Square that rings incessantly, we're talking every 15 minutes, even at night. Obviously not the hotel's fault but annoying, and you can hear it all over the city, so no escaping it.The hotel had a SUPER breakfast buffet - hot and cold foods, fruit, cheeses, you name it. Amsterdam itself was fabulous. LOVED IT.Things to do there: Van Gogh museum was great; Anne Frank house is a must-see; rent a bike like the locals do! Heineken Brewery tour was fun as well. We thought the Rijksmuseum was boring and overrated; wouldn't recommend unless you really are into the Dutch masters. Trams are a super way to get around; easy city to explore on foot.

The public areas were immaculate, the room was comfortable and clean the staff were friendly and the breakfast buffet was brilliant. We asked for a quiet room and thats what we got at the back of the hotel. Also the location was perfect, close to everything. Iwould highly recommend the Avenue Hotel.

<Content>Over-rated I can't help but shake my head when I see the pictures of the room that is displayed on the Avenue's homepage. Be aware that the room I was given when I stayed at the Avenue in 2003 was absolutley NOTHING like the picture - not even close! I was given a small, pokey room in which I was only just able to squeeze my suitcase into. The room had a single window overlooking an alley that could only be sealed from the cold winds by stuffing toilet paper between the window and the pane. The phone didn't work, there was only one English-speaking television channel (which had terrible reception), and they didn't provide sheets on the bed, rather, there was only a somewhat worn comforter. The bed was hard (which may suit some, but was way too hard for me) and the pillow was thin. The breakfast buffet was O.K. but nothing to write home about, and certainly not enough reason to want to return. In the 6 days I was there I didn't once see anyone using the small bar, nor did I ever see a staff member behind the bar to indicate it was even open. The only shining light was the location - which almost every reviewer on this site has already commented upon. There's no doubt the Avenue is very convenient to Central Station, the Dam and the major tourist sites of A'dam - but so are many of A'dam's other tourist-class hotels. I'm returning to A'dam later this year and have booked to stay at the recently built (2002) Ibis Stopera. As a chain hotel it may not have the 'charm' of the Avenue, but at least I know the rooms will be uniform and exactly as pictured on their web-site, if the phone doesn't work they'll fix it, and hopefully I won't have to shove toilet paper around the edges of the window to stay warm! I.M.O. the Avenue is over-priced and there are many better hotel options in A'dam that are cheaper, are as conveniently located, and that have better rooms and more facilities. I wouldn't recommend staying there - it's just too hit and miss.

<Content>Good Quality 3* Hotel Myself and my boyfriend stayed her in March 2005. We booked it online and got a very reasonable price, given that this hotel is in the city centre, close to Central Station and of a good standard.The room was excellent, spotlessly clean with modern facilities. The breakfast offered variety and was filling and the staff were always pleasant and smiling. The only downside was the noise outside the hotel which meant the room window couldn't be opened on a night time.The hotel is close to all the attractions (e.g. canal boats, shopping streets, Dam Square) and is a 5 minute walk from the train station (follow the street that trams 1  5 go down). Come out of the hotel and walk left a few paces and you'll find the best restaurant in Amsterdam. Its called Humphreys and is located next door to the Tulip Inn. They offer a set 3 course menu with a choice of 5 dishes for each course for only 18.95 Euros. The atmosphere is very intimate, the staff are wonderful and the food is Mmmmmm!!!Overall I can highly recommend this hotel and will be staying here on our next visit.

The only complaint about the room was how noisy it was from the trams that run outside the window. As there is no Air Con in the rooms we had the window open and it was very noisy. If I wnt agian I would request a room on the inside.The breakfast was very good, the location great, about 5 min walk from dam saquare and the staff were friendly.Overall good value.

<Content>Great Hotel The Avenue Hotel was a great bargain for the money. We stayed there in September 2004 and were quite pleased with the hotel. We read the reviews on it in Trip Advisor and based our choice on them. The hotel was well located, clean, nicely furnished, and the breakfast was terrific. The staff was more than helpful. I'd stay there again.

<Content>Clean hotel, Brilliant location and Friendly staff I recently stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and have to say for a budget hotel the room was clean (if a bit small) and the staff were very friendly. The location was also excellent being very close to the central station and convenient for all the night spots. If you are planning on hitting the town for a weekend give this place a try. You could do a lot worse. A hearty buffet breakfast was included.

<Content>Great Value stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in a double room with my girlfriend. Had everything we wanted, rooms were clean along with the bathroom. Staff were friendly and helpful. Well worth the money we payed and will use the avenue when returning to amsterdam.

<Content>Can't understand all the good reviews??? I agree completely with the last reviewer. The one saving grace for this hotel was the location. Very close to Central Station and most of main attractions but that was about it. My room was over the main street and it was very noisy. Trams and busses start running at 6am so if you are not used to city noise choose a room toward the back of the hotel. The rooms were tiny even for European standards. The rooms were clean but worn and were horribly designed. The room phone did not work when trying to call the states and my wife could not get through to me either. Thankfully I had a quad band cell phone that I just had to switch the sim card to be able to communicate with home. The front desk staff was average at best. One of the front desk people was very nice (a woman - forgot her name) but the rest seemed irratated at the 3 questions I asked them in the 8 days I was there. I noticed they seemed very put out when other guests were talking to them. There is a small bar but never had anyone in there. There was one computer in the bar for internet service. The computer worked but not the internet. No wireless internet. Breakfast was the same everyday and average. I am not one to complain - I have never written a bad review for anything before but in my opinion you can do much better for the same money in Amsterdam.

<Content>Not impressed I don't really understand what all the fuss is about. I didn't think this hotel was that great at all. In fact, I thought it looked in a rather fragile state. Obviously, it could've been just my room. For nearly 拢100 per night, I expected a lot more from this 3* star hotel. We've booked a double room but were given a twin room instead. We were told that no double room would become available. Our room was tiny. The twin beds were pushed together and there was no space to separate them. Both beds kept sliding away from each other though. The TV sat snug between the ceiling and the walls, clearly because there was no space to fit it else where. The bathroom was an absolute disgrace. I could tell it was clean but it looked filthy with the moulded and broken tiles. The shower was just a showerhead spraying on the bathroom floor. The breakfast was hot buffet and okay. I wouldn't rave about it though. The location was perfect. It is very close to Central Station and a short walk away from the Dam. I have always stayed near Central Station but I think it has become very gritty in the past years. Next time I'll go to Amsterdam I'd rather stay in the Jordaan which is by far the greatest location in Amsterdam and not all bulldozed by hen and stag parties. I've been disappointed by hotel Avenue, then again, I haven't seen any of the other rooms therefore cannot compare.

<Content>Good Value Hotel I stayed at the Avenue Hotel for 4 nights in May 2004 and overall, I enjoyed my stay. Having said that, I think your experience of this hotel will very much depend on the type of room which you are allocated. As the hotel is made up of old canal houses, the rooms vary widely in size and many of the rooms are oddly shaped. I had a single room which was very small and poky, with no window and a bathroom which could do with some updating. However, I had called up the hotel in advance to request a nice room for my parents and they were allocated a spacious double room which was clean, well furnished and very pleasantly decorated. Their bathroom was fairly small but clean, modern and perfectly functional. Their room did overlook the street so there was some noise from passing trams etc but they didn't find it too bad. The public areas of the hotel are pleasant, well decorated and clean and, as other reviewers have mentioned, the complimentary buffet breakfast is a great bonus. This hotel is in a good location for trams, and for the dam square end of town, plenty of shops, bars and restaurants etc in the immediate vicinity of the hotel and not too much of a walk from the other nighlife areas such as Rembrandtsplein. The tram from just outside the hotel will also take you right down to Leidseplein. For evening meals, I would highly recommend Humphrey's restaurant which is in one of the side streets just down from the hotel (underneath the Golden Tulip Inntel Hotel) which serves very high quality fixed price menus in a nice atmosphere.

The room was clean and well decorated, the bathroom was spacious and had a hairdryer, shower and bath. The breakfast was excellent, there was so much to choose from and the staff are very friendly and helpful. We will be staying at the Avenue on our next visit as it is also in an ideal location.

<Content>some rooms are miniscule I stayed at the Avenue two years ago. Overall the hotel was OK (2-3 star/no frills) but the room we were allocated was tiny. We asked to be moved to a larger (standard) room but were told all the rooms were the same. We decided to leave and check into a decent hotel. On departing, we could see open doors to much more substantial bedrooms. Moved to the Marriot which was the business. Much nicer area too. In brief, hotel OK but be canny!

Breakfast is also a filler which sets you up nicely. Hotel is well located 5 mins walk from Centraal Station and Dam Square. Overall, a hotel well worthy of a look. Was only 拢80 for the 2 nights

<Content>What A Lovely Service I have stayed there for 4 night and what i can say is this hotel is worth to stay if you are looking for a pleasent service and excellent pricing on room rates.I come from Malaysia (in Asia), and i thought GOOD SERVICE is only have in Asia but i am wrong. Try out the bar which is located in the lobby, look for Ruth. She is sweet and nice to talk to. Very friendly staff from Reception all the way to the Bar.You will never regret to have a night stay over there. Trust me.Keep up the good work Avenue Hotel.

<Content>Well impressed A party of 4 went booked into the Avenue based on reviews from this website. This was our second visit to Amsterdam this year and we were all very impressed with the Avenue. We stayed in a quad room which was a good size and the room was clean. The staff were more than friendly and helpful and i thought the location of the hotel was ideal - not far from the station and close to all the attractions that we were interested in. I can't recommend this hotel enough - so much so we have already planned our next trip to Amsterdam and have rebooked to stay at the Avenue!!

<Content>Great hotel - Only so-so location Our room was extremely comfortable - roomy, clean and nicely decorated. The hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast was better than most. The tram runs directly in front of the hotel, which was great! The hotel is also very centrally located - within a 5 minute walk from the Central Station. To me, this was a drawback. Lots of shaggy-looking kids with backpacks walking around and tons of souvenir stands and very touristy restaurants nearby. If I were to come back, I'd look for something comparable but situated in a more elegant part of town (the Jordan district?), preferably overlooking a canal; with a better selection of restaurants and cafes within walking distance.

<Content>great location just back from A'Dam 16/10/04 .before booking our 5day trip to the Avenue hotel we first looked up the trip advisor reviews,most reviews were spot on so we were not dissapointed when we checked in, yes it is three star but i can tell you that a couple of other so called 3* hotels in and around the same area didnt have a patch on the Avenue.as for the accomadation ,we had a double room situated 3 floors up(lift access to all floors) running down an alley way (so what) less noise as the front of the hotel had trams running up and down from early morning till late at night. not the hotels fault as the 5* crown plaza hotel is next door they also had same problem.the toilet is a bit small but full bath and shower with sink and hair dryer done the job.full breakfast included cold meats,cheese,cereals coffeee tea and juices, also bacon egg sausages and pancakes as much as you could eat to set you up for the day.all staff were very polite and nothing was a problem.security isnt a problem either at night someone is always on the door(reception area) which has to be opened by touch pad from the inside , safe deposit boxes in locked room requiring 2 key system, and also a left luggage room for the last day which is also locked and free.if i was ever going back to the Dam then i would certainly go back to the Avenueif its 5* your looking for then book 5* but if you cant afford it then go to the Avenue.

<Content>Central, reasonably priced and safe Stayed there in May as a result of the comments here. Am going back in a couple of weeks' time which has to be the best recommendation. Really what everyone else said - friendly, English-speaking staff, excellent breakfast buffet, 5 minutes' walk one way to the station, the other way to Dam Square, another way to the canals. Pleasant neighbourhood and, for a female travelling on her own, a safe environment.The only beef I might have is that the single room I had was very small, looking out over an alleyway, but it's an old building so that's understandable.Overall a nice central reasonably priced place to stay.

<Content>Centrally located, clean, and good price I have booked this three-star-plus accomodation through Connect Hotel in England and received, in advance, a brochure of the hotel and tourist information about Amsterdam. Their service was impeccable. I paid 拢85 for one night in April, not cheap but good price for value in a major European capital. The hotel has a friendly atmosphere and is clean. It is close to both the station and the city centre with its tourist sights. There are other, four-star and five-star hotels nearby, so you are in a good neighbourhood but spare a few pounds for sightseeing. I can recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good Value for the Price I recently spent 3 days at the Avenue. Had a single room which was small but had all you need. Who goes to Adam to spend time in the room anyway? The bed was ok, bathroom clean, plenty of hot water and pressure. A little bit noisy from the trams and pedestrians on the street but not intolerable. Breakfast was typical, scrambled eggs, bacon, juice, rolls, coffee. Very convenient to Central Station, the Dam and a variety of attractions. Not 5 star but certainly worth the money.

<Content>Perfectly situated Excellent central location, walking distance from railway station, even with luggage. Helpful friendly staff/everyone speaks English. Breakfast plentiful and served until 10am.Rooms clean ... but so small, totally different to the advertised photograph. The wardrobe had room for just four hangers and the view was of other windows looking down on us over a kind of roof area with discarded cigarette's etc. Asked for a possible room change without luck. As this was a special birthday treat for my husband it was very disappointing. Suggest if you book that you check on your room size first!

<Content>way more than a 3* hotel! Absolutely brilliant hotel, somehow right slap bang in the middle of everything, yet just enough out of the way for it to be really quiet and peaceful at night. Our room was on the top floor, was plenty big enough, nice and clean, and with a highly impressive sparkling white en suite bathroom. A door/large window opened overlooking the alleyway near us, which we used to go directly to the centre. Breakfast small yet filling, try the mini potato cakes, they're excellent. The walk to centraal only takes 5 mins tops. If you're going to Amsterdam and intend to be near the centre of town, but far enough away to escape the noise, this is the one for you.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed in this hotel in Jan 2003 for 3 nights. We where made so welcome by the hotel staff. Very friendly and polite. Our room was ready for us at 10am. Which was great. The room was very nice and bathroom was spotless. Our room had french doors that opened up, which was nice. The buffet breakfast was very good. This was our 3rd stay in Amsterdam, we picked this hotel because we got a great deal. Very glad we stayed there. In fact when we go again in June 2004, we have already rebooked this hotel.We travel a lot to Amsterdam, and like to try out the different hotels. This is well worth a stay, also in a great location. Central Station is a mere 10 min walk.

I expected it to be a standard 3* BB but was plesently surprised at how clean and friendly it was. It is down the street from a police station, there is a tram stop nearly right outside and a taxi rank a minutes walk away. The hotel is open all night, but they have a guard on the door... so no matter what time you get come back you can always get in, knowing that no dodgy characters will be following you in!

<Content>Excellent Location I stayed at the Avenue hotel for 2 nights 22/3 - 23/3. This hotel is in an excellent location for shopping, sight seeing and only a 5 min walk from the train station. No need to catch any taxi's. The breakfast was excellent, cold meats and cheese as well as bacon, sausage etc, cereals and breads. The only fault i could find was with the size of the rooms. I think we must of had the smallest room in amsterdam, but the power shower made up for it. I would go back to this hotel but i'd ask for a larger room.

<Content>Very Good for a 3*** Hotel I've stayed at the Avenue Hotel on three separate occasions. It is conveniently located just a five minute walk from Amsterdam's Centraal Station on a fairly busy, wide street that has cars and trams circulating. It is not the quietest location, but it is lively and surrounded by some pretty buildings. It is just a short walk to Dam Square from the hotel, so you are definitely in the central part of the city. The hotel is a 3 star hotel, so don't expect luxury. That said, it is clean, well furnished, and includes a full buffet breakfast as part of the room cost. The lobby and rooms are tastefully done with modern decor using subdued tones and wooden furnishings. The single rooms are small by American standards, but that is to be expected of hotels in the Avenue's category. If you want large rooms, expect to pay more at more upscale locations. I've stayed at other more expensive three star hotels in Amsterdam and the Avenue is by far the best.
