<Content>Long Over Due Review This was our 3rd trip to the Davanzati since 2006. This is by far our favorite hotel in Italy. You are a few blocks from most the major sites in Florence. Fabrizio  Tommaso always go out of their way helping their guests. They take care of all your bookings  reservations. No need to wait in long lines at the museums. They handle it all for free. You can not beat the location, or the service at the Davanzati. We look forward to coming back again next year.... Its beginning to be an annual thing with us... :)

<Content>Highly overrated, but ok. My wife and I went to Florence as part of honeymoon in Italy and we chose Hotel Davanzati because it was highly rated on tripadvisor.We both felt that the hype was very overrated. As the other reviews state, the customer service and hospitality were great but isn't that standard at most hotels?Room was average, a little dusty. Customer service was good, as expected.Location was good.

<Content>Christmas in Florence The Hotel Davanzati was a wonderful place to spend 3 nights over the Christmas holiday. The location is ideal for walking throughout Florence, easy access to the museums, restaurants, shopping. The hotel management was extremely helpful in making museum reservations as well as dinner recommendations/reservations. We were very pleased to be included in the Christmas dinner that was hosted by Fabrizio, Tommaso and their families. The lovely buffet and bottle of wine were much appreciated. The happy hour was also a nice break each day. The hospitality shown by the staff at this hotel is exceptional.We were traveling with our family (my mother, husband and I along with 2 daughters, ages 20 and 17). The adjoining rooms were very convenient. The rooms were comfortable and well decorated. The availability of the laptop and DVD players is a nice feature in this hotel. We hope to return to Florence in the future, we would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Family Hotel We just returned last week from our family holiday in Europe and will always have fond memories of the three days we spent in Florence. Our visit to this beautiful city was made even more enjoyable because of the fact that we chose to stay at the Davanzati. From the moment we arrived, we felt welcome because of the wonderful hospitality extended to us by Fabrizio, Tommaso and the rest of the friendly and efficient staff. The rooms were comfortable, immaculately clean and surprisingly spacious. My husband and I particularly enjoyed the candlelit Happy Hour, which occurred every evening, since it gave us the opportunity to relax after a busy day of sightseeing and to exchange stories and travel tips with the other guests. Our two teenage sons, on the other hand, were more impressed that their room provided complimentary internet access as well as a laptop and a Playstation 2.The Davanzati was our favourite hotel of the trip and we would certainly have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone thinking of visiting Florence.

<Content>Great Place-lives up to its reputation! My 11-year old son and I stayed at the Hotel Davanzati for three nights in early December 2008. We chose it for location, free use of internet and a laptop, and because of its great reviews on this site. In our experience, the place was great. Fabrizio and Tommaso, the family and staff were all so friendly and made us feel right at home. Our room was about three steps up from the lobby. It was a large room, with two twin beds, sofa, armoire, desk with laptop, Playstation 2, and a large bathroom with a full-size bathtub (not just a shower stall). The room also had a mini bar (which we did not use) and a safe. I also liked that there was no carpet on the floor. It was cold out while we were there (just above freezing sometimes), and the room stayed warm with two steam radiators. We also kept the shutters closed which helped keep out the cold. The room was quiet despite facing front but in the summer it could be a bit louder as there would be more pedestrian traffic at night. (There are white noise machines in the rooms that can be used if this is a problem.)Breakfast was continental with delicious cappucinos and pastries and rolls etc. My son loved the chocolate breakfast cake which he would never get at home and the hot chocolate. Evening happy hour / cocktails was great. Nice to relax over a glass of prosecco. The location was convenient to everything-shopping, restaurants, museums, the Arno. I loved being in the middle of everything. We stayed in an apartment in Rome near the Tiber that was on Via Guila but also very quiet and not as convenient to the sights. We ate down the block at La Bussola per Fabrizio's recommendation. It was so good we went back for a second visit .If I am ever so lucky to get back to Florence, I will head back to the Hotel Davanzati. Regards from the Middle East Fabrizio and Tommaso, and thanks for the wonderful stay.

<Content>This hotel made us feel at home in Florence I stayed at Davanzati with my parents for three nights from 18-21 December after an apartment rental I had made fell through. They had their own room and ensuite and I had mine with a door in between connecting each area. The rooms (101 and 102) were beautifully decorated and modern, the beds were very comfortable, the floor was red tiled and warm, heating could be adjusted, there was also air conditioning, the rooms were each equipped with LCD TVs, playstation, fridge, laptop and internet access. My parents' room had a sofa and was larger. We also shared a small patio which in summer must be really nice. Other amenities included free DVD rental, guide book and other books and magazines.I asked for quiet rooms and the rooms were both facing to an inside patio and extremely quiet. There is also double glazing.But what really made the stay at this hotel memorable was how helpful and warm Fabrizio and Tommaso were during our stay. They recommended really good restaurants, made bookings and provided good advice. At 6.30 there is also a happy hour with free drinks and snacks with funky music for guests to chill out before going out at night.I totally recommend this hotel. When I come back to Florence, I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great location, nice hotel We stayed at the Davanzati for two nights for our honeymoon. The hotel is perfectly situated in Florence, and walking distance to just about everything. While the initial steps up to the elevator can be a challenge to certain travelers, the hotel is very clear about this when you book. In fact, the people that own and run this hotel are very up-front about any concerns that might come up, and this attention to detail is very appreciated. Overall, they were very friendly to us, and super helpful with everything from restaurants to getting taxis. The room was very clean and they clearly care about the comfort of their guests.Something that was very impressive was that when I screwed up majorly on some reservations to a gallery, they really went above and beyond to fix this and get us in!My only complaint, (and I say this with the full disclosure that I never brought this to the the staff's attention so they were never given the chance to rectify this), was that the room had a strong smell of vinegar. Since we were only there for two days and I kept thinking I could get used to it, I didn't say anything. Again, the hotel never knew so they should not be judged on this! I also didn't like that the only room window overlooked an airshaft and the students renting the apartment next door had their door open to their balcony and were chatting day and night.That being said, I would definitely recommend the Davanzati, it definitely deserves its excellent reputation. Just maybe ask about the amenities and location of the room while booking.

<Content>Worth the #1 Rating! The hotel is fantastic, the location incredible, and the hotel managers truly wonderful. The father and son team that run the hotel define 'customer service'. They've thought of every detail in their hotel (even laptops provided in the rooms) and honestly work very hard to make sure you have a unique and wonderful experience. I can't think of a nicer place to stay - in perhaps the nicest city in the world.My only slight criticism is the hotel is located near two nightclubs (within two blocks of the hotel) - so if you are allergic to both noise and alcohol (i.e. you won't be a bit sleepy from wine at dinner :) you may want to request a room that doesn't overlook the main street (and knowing the hotel management, they will do everything they can to accommodate your request). If you are seeking a bit more nightlife, you won't have to look far. We slept streeetside. Personally, I found the windows to block the noise and slept like a baby (though I had 'some' wine at dinner :).The location is within walking distance to everything in Florence and is only a ~10 Euro taxi ride to the train station. If you only have a few days in Florence, I cannot imagine a better place to stay.

<Content>So much to see - so little time ! Wonderful 4-night stay at the Davanzati. Friendly welcome, warm, clean, smart accommodation. Staff always helpful and pleasant. The hotel had been recommended to us but we were still very pleasantly surprised. It was great being right in the centre of things and we walked our socks off taking in as many places/sights as possible. We really enjoyed the 'no pressure' Happy Hour' and had a lot of fun sharing the day's experiences with the other guests. Exploring the city's cobbled streets was an experience in itself and they threw up some surprising sights - restaurants/shops and churches that seemed to appear as if from nowhere.Certainly hope to return to Florence and the Davanzati in particular.J.

There's a number 5 Via Porta Rossa on both sides of the main streets and our iPhones, at least, lead us to the wrong number 5. Nevertheless, thiis is a very pleasant place to stay.

<Content>Exceeded expectations set by even the best of reviews I chose the hotel by its exceptional reviews here and by it's location and... our experience exceeded all these very high expectations. Fabrizio was wonderful in recommending restaurants, making reservations (for tours and dinners), and setting up priorities for our mere 3 days in Florence. He and Tommaso (as well as other family members, in the breakfast room) tended to every concern of ours (room too hot or too cold, DVD is scratched, where can we take emergency-case passport photos...). Our room was spacious and comfortable. And, the extra special perk was that our room was equipped with a laptop, all set-up for internet access (which saved us the hassle of adjusting out laptop, yet again, to the whims of yet another hotel system). And I did not yet mention the perfect location?! Enjoy!

I booked a one night stay with my Mom at the the Hotel Davanzati based on strong reviews on this website and certainly was not disappointed. They were expecting us when we arrived and gave us a large, clean room with separate twins as requested. Soon after arriving, we were invited to pre-dinner wine and snacks in the hotel's pleasant dining room. They have free books (including guides to Florence if you don't feel like lugging your own book with you) and movies for entertainment. They also provide a laptop with internet access in your room, which is incredibly convenient. Nice freindly staff with useful recommendations and provided us with a big umbrella for the rain. Highly recommended.

<Content>Fantastic!!! Miss it already! This place is AWESOME. The hotel we were at earlier that week had problems with the heat and hot h2o. We walked around the corner and they were able to accomodate us for 3 nights. Happy hour is fantastic. We met some wonderful new friends during the happy hour and was able to enjoy Florence even more with new found friends. The owers there are amazing, very accomodating and I would have paid more to stay there with all that they had to offer their guests. Great central location to walk to all the major sites (very near the main drag) BUT double almost sound prrof windows-bravo!, wonderful insight to local restaurant suggestions, good breakfast, very clean rooms, great beds-nice down comforter, and up to date options (free computer and internet in your room) how cool is that!We cannot wait to plan our next trip back here. They really made our Italy experience fantastic despite the cold spell in Nov. Job well DONE!

<Content>Firenze and Fabrizio The warm hospitality extended by Fabrizio and his family at the Davanzati Hotel truly made my first visit to Italy an unforgettable experience that I will cherish forever. All of the major sights were within walking distance from the hotel. I stayed at the hotel for 7 nights so I was able to cover a lot and enjoy all the wonderful things Firenze had to offer. I started early in the morning with my sighseeings but when I got tired, it was so nice to be able to walk back to the hotel to take a midday break and go out later again feeling refreshed and ready for more. The timeless beauty of Firenze took my breath away. Thank you, Fabrizio and your family, for your kindness and hospitality. I wish I could have stayed longer.......

<Content>It really is that good..... In these days of spam, viruses and junk mail and more disappointments than joy, I read the reviews with some scepticism.But the Hotel Davanzati really is as good as they say. A smart, modern hotel in an old building beautifully restored in a fantastic location. But best of all Fabrizio, Tommaso and all their staff really are fantastically welcoming, knowlegeable and ultra, ultra helpful.My scepticism also leads me to not normally take proprietor's dinner recomendations too seriously - to many brothers and cousins! But we took three recomendations over three nights and ate fabulously - not just good choices, but fantastic. Three nights out of three is quite a hit rate! And all the restaurants were full of locals, which is always a great sign.So, we couldn't recommend it more. If you want to do all you can to guarantee a great stay in Florence, book the Davanzati (and trust the recommendations of Fabrizio and Tommaso!!). This is a real find that we definitely return to.

<Content>Wonderful in every way This small, remarkably well-located hotel is the most hospitable place we've ever stayed. For 12 years, my work has led to me traveling 155 days a year -- but I enjoyed this hotel more than any I've stayed in. Tommaso and Fabrizio welcome all guests, serve with warmth and efficiency and provide the kinds of amenities that foster relationship among guests. When we someday return to Florence, we surely will return to the Hotel Davanzati.

<Content>Excellent Stay-Again My sister and I stayed at the Hotel Davanzati for 4 nights this November. This is my 2nd stay at the hotel this year. My time here previously was wonderful and I knew Hotel Davanzati wouldn't fail me a second time, which it didn't. Our reservations were made directly with the hotel and I received a prompt confirmation on on my dates (we were even put in the same room I stayed in previously, which was nice). The room is nice sized with two beds and a computer with internet access. The staff gave us wonderful recommendations for lunch and dinner, even making reservations for us. Breakfast was a very nice simple Italian breakfast which offered American coffee for those that preferred it. Happy hour from 6:30 to 7:30pm is a great time to mingle and enjoy a pre-dinner drink. It was a nice touch to a wonderful stay. The hotel is located in a nice street minutes from all sites. I look forward to my third trip to this hotel. Thank you Hotel Davanzati for making our stay in Florence so memorable.

<Content>The Best This hotel was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. We had actually come from a hotel that didn't meet our expectations and were forced to switch to a new one our first day. This place was recommended to me, and we were fortunate to book a room that same day.The rooms are huge, especially for Italy. They include a laptop with unlimited internet, a living room, two flat screen TVs, and a spotless room that looks brand new. The hotel stay includes a Happy Hour with free wine and food for an hour. It's a very social atmosphere where we were able to meet other guests. Not only is the hotel helpful, but they actually care and get to know you. One of the highlights of my trip to Northern Italy. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Florence.

<Content>Davanzati gem of a hotel in a gem of a city We booked this hotel based on the praise it received on this website and the advance praise (believe it or not) did not do it justice. I have traveled to Italy many times, visited Florence several times and this hotel surpassed all of my previous experiences. The only regret my wife and I had regarding Hotel Davanzati is that we were only staying 3 nights. Every facet of this hotel was top-notch. From Fabrizio's greeting at check-in, to his excellent restaurant recommendations, to our wonderful room, we could not have been more pleased. The laptop and playstation in our room was a great bonus and it was nice to be able to watch a DVD after dinner. The comfort of the bed in our room far surpassed any other bed we slept in during the rest of our trip through Italy. The bathroom was also spacious compared to the typical Italian hotel bathroom with a shower that actually could accomodate a normal sized adult. The continental breakfast in the morning was also nice with freshly made capuccino and a variety of breads, pastries, fruit, etc. Finally, we especially enjoyed the complimentary evening happy hour with the light snacks and prosecco. It was nice to chat with fellow guests or just sit quietly and enjoy our beverages. Our lasting memory of our honeymoon in Italy will be our stay in Florence. My wife and I already started making plans for a return trip next year...assuming we can find availability at the Hotel Davanzati.

<Content>Like staying with your cool Italian relatives If you鈥檙e looking for a small, chic, family-run hotel in the heart of Florence, you probably won鈥檛 do much better than Hotel Davanzati. The charming family owners greet you with recognition as you come and go, making you feel comfortable and at home.GETTING THERE: We took a 22 euro, fixed-rate cab ride from the airport. On Sunday evening, at least, it was incredibly quick and easy. If arriving by train, I鈥檇 hire a cab to take you to the hotel. It鈥檚 not real far, but the roads aren鈥檛 ideal for dragging bags.LOCATION: Perfect. You can walk to almost anywhere, but it鈥檚 off the beaten path just enough to provide some quiet. The exterior stairs up actually provide a greater sense of refuge and peace from the street.  ABOUT THOSE STAIRS: Lots of talk about the stairs on Trip Advisor, but honestly, they aren鈥檛 that bad. Get staff to carry up your bags if you need help. Otherwise, the reality of visiting Florence is tons of stairs and cobblestone streets. Think of the stairs as a screening, just like old second-story dentists figured their patients were healthy enough for dental work if they survived the stairs.  ROOMS: Not huge, but clean and functional. Simple, minimalist urban d茅cor. Internet鈥檚 a big plus. We had a little noise from our neighbor鈥檚 room a couple nights, but my earplugs solve that. HAPPY HOUR: With lights dimmed and techno jazz playing, we felt much cooler than we really are.PRICE: We had a 182 euro rate but got a 10% discount by paying cash. Tomasso can quote you your exact discount total before check-out so you can accrue enough cash. (You need to pay 100% cash to get the discount鈥攏ot a combination of cash and credit cards鈥攂ut well worth the trouble.) We liked using the ATM inside the post office across the street.FAMILY OWNERS: I think the family element鈥檚 the magic to this place. Have Fabrizio pour you some wine at happy hour. Visit with his chic wife, Patricia, and ask how this 50-something grandmother gets to work each day. (A Vespa!) Sister-in-law Sofia made us great caf茅鈥?lattes at breakfast and convinced us to visit the Pitti Palace. Tomasso, the charming son, resembles a 1950鈥檚 movie idol鈥攍ike where young American girls fall in love with the devastatingly handsome young Italian man. (He will blush when he reads this, but it鈥檚 true.)CONCLUSION: Hotel Davanzati鈥檚 a great little gem for travelers who want something other than a cookie-cutter experience. Like maybe warmth, charm and ideal location.

<Content>Great find Easy to find, coming from the West coast in the evening.Some steep stairs before the lift access might be a limiting factor for some however, the welcome was genuine and staff were most helpful.Central position in town close to the river and tourist attractions but no parking at the hotel itself. I thought the parking charge was a little expensive however, we left early in the morning and the car was left ready for us.Thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone planning a break in the city.

<Content>A gem of a hotel What a gem of a hotel!Do not be put off by the entrance steps which seem dark and unprepossessing. Once you are in the foyer you will be greeted and receive excellent service. This is a hotel with an excellent location for the major tourist attractions - everything is within easy walking distance. The hotel staff believe in good service and nothing seems too much trouble.The hotel's 'happy hour' with free bruschetta  wine was a pleasant opportunity to meet fellow guests. The free use of a laptop in the room was a very welcome perk.This is a family run hotel which is clean, friendly  has a sense of pride in the service that it offers. It is not modern or 'uber smart' but offers so much else instead.We would not hesitate to stay again and would fully recommend this hotel.

<Content>Best hotel yet. I have stayed in hotels all over the world, mostly 4 and 5 star places for work and I am yet to experience another place of the same quality as this. It is not the most luxurious or the grandest but they have the best service I have ever come across, really nice rooms and free wi-fi. If you don鈥檛 stay here in Florence you are missing out. Within hours of booking I received a personalised email from the owner, Fabrizio, offering assistance with anything I required with my stay, I took him up on his offer and he booked me some museum tickets at no charge- when I got there he advised me that there had not been many people at that museum that afternoon (unusual) and I could save money using another entry method instead of the reservation he had made for me saving us the additional cost. He also spent time explaining to us all the things to do and the most efficient method to achieve what we want and gave us maps in the process. He had personally looked out for our welfare and we were grateful, this is the sort of service that you can receive at this hotel- in a modern world this place is a breath of fresh air. Free wi-fi, including a free computer in the room, we had our own computer so he gave us two log-on codes for both computers free.Free movies or games.Huge room by any standards and very clean and comfortableFree wine and nibbles in the bar at an appointed time in the evening designed to allow the guest to meet and chat.When we arrived in this hotel we had been travelling for a while and been in and out of many other hotels and this place shocked us with the fabulous service. Another thing, we suffered a bit of a family emergency and had to travel back to London and Fabrizio helped us out with anything we required and was very understanding and courteous. If you are in Florence don鈥檛 stay anywhere else.

<Content>Davanzati - you are the Best! This was our 2nd visit to Davanzati, so obviously we were impressed the first time (May 2005 after reading TripAdvisor comments). Would we still be impressed?Davanzati was even better than we remembered - still the wonderful personal service from Fabrizio and Tommaso - working on our behalf to make our holiday a success and to make us fall in love with Florence again. Train and bus times checked, taxis arriving at the door in 2 minutes, and restaurants booked with the click of a mouse - suitcases loaded in our taxi when we departed.Our room and bathroom were large and lovely and also spotless. Our laptop meant we were able to check emails etc, new flatscreen tv. New features which added to our enjoyment but we didn't get time to watch too much tv. Happy hour - with candlelight and funky music - free lovely chianti, proscecco and nibbles put us in the right mood for evenings in Florence.Breakfast was a calm moment in the day with plenty of choice for every taste - together with that personal service. This family constantly strive (and succeed) in providing top service. The position of Davanzati could not be better and all museums, galleries etc are within easy walking distance.We will certainly be back. If anything, we enjoyed our second visit more than the first. Let's hope this family keep running this wonderful oasis for many years to come.

<Content>Ok, but nothing extraordinary I would like to start this review by letting the readers know something about the reviewer. I like new, contemporary hotels and tend to be comfortable in large business chain facilities. Give me a new Meridien, Westin or Marriott and I am generally pleased. While many find such hotels cold, I love them. I am not a B  B person and quaint does not interest me. While I enjoy good service, it isn't usually a factor in selecting a hotel.For these reasons I did not think the Davanzati was for me. However, the gushing and extremely favorable reviews of this hotel kept catching my attention. I have never seen such uniformly highly favorable reviews of any hotel in any part of the world and finally decided to give the Davanzati a try.I expected to either love or hate this hotel. In the end, I found it be be ok without either loving it or hating it. I truly cannot understand the high rating so many others gave to the Davanzati.On the positive side, Tomasso and Fabrizio were all they were cracked up to be. They really went out of the way to accomodate us. Tomasso's restaurant recommendations were incredibly good and our meals at his restaurants were the highlight of our visit to Florence. Our superior double room was large, even by American standards. The room was quiet and the air-conditioning worked well. The king size bed was comfortable. The bathroom was large. The hotel's location could not have been better.On the negative side, we found our room to be dark and gloomy. The furniture (except the bed) was modest; almost spartan. The shower was awkward to use even by Italian standards and the bathroom was dark. My wife missed having a make-up mirror.I would consider staying at the Davanzati on a return visit but would also look for alternatives.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel in Florence We spent 4 wonderful nights at the Hotel Davanzati. A friend raved about the property and it lived up to everything she had said about it. From the moment we walked into the reception area Fabrizo took care of us. Our room was clean, comfortable and well appointed and the lap top was a great addition. Florence was a high light of our 2.5 week stay in Italy and the Hotel Davanzati was the best property of the five we stayed in while traveling.You will love it!

<Content>Not the greatest this trip This was the second time we stayed at the Davazanti and were given a fairly large room that was as if we were in a basement with a high window only looking up onto someone's private apartment doorway -- the room was otherwise nice but, geeze, rather claustrophobic and dreary with no daylight in the window. Breakfasts are fairly ordinary, certainly not the best in Italy; the rooms boast a convenient and handy laptop with free internet service. Fabrizio and Tomaso were most helpful in arranging dinner reservations. They have what could be a delightful gratis happy hour each evening with prosecco and red wine that is to my taste ruined by the very loud and abrasive/racuous music, perhaps purposefully designed to get people in and out quickly. We likely will stay elsewhwere during future trips to Firenze.

<Content>Another great stay at Hotel Davanzati We stayed at Hotel Davanzati in 2006 and decided to return as part of our 25th anniversary trip. It felt like coming home and was even better than before. We had the same room and it had been beautifully redecorated. Fabrizio, Tommaso and the family's hospitality was just as gracious. Breakfast and happy hour were delicious. The location is perfect for visiting the sights. There are a number of steps from the street up to the elevator, so be aware if you have mobility issues. The staff was great about hauling our luggage up and down since my husband has a bad back. We hope to go back to Florence some day and want to stay at Hotel Davanzati when we do.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, staff and city There is not a thing we didn't like about Hotel Davanzati. The location is fantastic and our room was clean and lovely (the laptop in the room was especially enjoyed). The staff was the best in all of the four hotels we stayed during our trip in Italy. Fabrizio went out of his way to make reservations and find exactly what we were looking for (small, romantic, outside, etc.). His insider hints of where to buy leather goods and to get a great view of Florence (the top of the department store that had a simple but delightful cafe was one) were things we would never had known about without his help. The stairs at the entrance were not a problem - even after being out walking all day - as it is not unusual in all of Italy to have to walk up stairs to reach many sites. The hotel was very helpful in carrying luggage and purchased good up and down for your convenience. We stayed for 3 nights and cannot wait for our next trip back.

<Content>Amazing!!!! The highlight of our honeymoon was cominbg to Florence, arriving at the most welcoming hotel we have ever stayed at and being able to travel around Florence with such ease and always only a stones throw from the hotel due to its amazing location!! From the moment we arrived we felt like royalty in how we were greeted and treated all the way throughout our stay. The room was amazing and the first hotel suite ever that I have stayed in and could have slept all day without being disturbed due to the peacefulness of the hotel! We will most certainly be back and would now regard the hotel as our home away from home. Thank you so much to the people there who made us feel most welcome...it was the highlight of our honeymoon!Michele and Will

<Content>Excellent Service, Location, and Ammenaties My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Davazati for our 3rd anniversary and was very impressed with the attentive and person touches of the staff, as well as great ammenities for a boutique hotel. The location is perfect, and within walking distance to the main sites. I had booked the hotel several months in advance and mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary. We were pleasantly surprised that Fabrizio remebered it was our anniversary months later and had a card and bottle of wine waiting in our room. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a stay in Florence.

<Content>Faultless Hotel My wife and I have just returned from a 3-night stay in Florence, staying at the Hotel Davanzati. We've never added a review from previous trips but feel that it is deserved for the Davanzati.Quite simply it can't be critisized.Firstly it's location is perfect - a short walk from the station and bang in the heart of the city so all the attractions are within a short walk.Secondly the staff. Always available, always helpful and always more than happy to assist with any ticket, travel or restaurant bookings.Thirdly the rooms. Clean and comfortable and all with free laptop and internet connection.Finally, the happy hour. Every evening between 6:30-7:30, drinks and snacks laid on for all guests that provides an opportunbity to meet other travellers. A great way to start each evening.Don't look anyway else if you are planning to visit Florence.

<Content>Fabulous Florence Hotel We heard about Hotel Davanzati through Rick Steves' Italy and as soon as we stepped into this charming hotel and met Fabrizio, we knew we had made the right choice. Fabrizio gave us wonderful suggestions as to where to eat at places that were reasonably priced and not touristy. Our room was beautiful, clean and even had a laptop computer with internet which was quite a surprise. Every morning we enjoyed a delicious breakfast served in the cozy dining room. The evening happy hour in the candlelit room with the Chianti, Perseco and delicious bruschetta was a special treat which was included in the price. We would highly recommend to anyone visiting Florence to stay here and enjoy the hospitality and warmth of Davanzati.

<Content>What a great find this hotel is! I researched this hotel through TripAdvisor and was not disappointed!....we had just come off a cruise and were expecting the typical small European room but we were surprised with an upgrade to a one bedroom unit with sitting area. Even without the upgrade this was a great spot....good location to walk to everything you want to see in Florence, the owners ( family owned business) are very helpful.The best thing about the room was the laptop and free internet service...what a treat that was to be able to connect with family  friends back home after spending big $$ for internet access on the cruise ship!!The Art Viva original walking tour of Florence was terrific! We had a great tour guide...Freya...an Australian art history graduate who really knew her stuff and made all the history that we learned on the walk interesting and fun.

The room was very clean, comfortable and quiet with plenty of room unlike many single rooms I've stayed in other European hotels. The warm greeting on arrival and friendly handshake on departure made my stay seem like staying with old friends. I would recommend this great hotel to anyone looking to stay in Florence and would definitely stay there again if I ever get back to Florence.Sue. Canberra Australia

<Content>Once you get past the stairs! ITS WONDERFUL The flight  1/2 of stairs is daunting for those of us that live in a home with no stairs, and has no reason is climb stairs. That should not compomise this hotel, you should just be aware. Porter came to the street immediately upon arrival to take luggage to our room and was available to return it to the street on departure. A wonderful family run hotel, Grampa, Father  Son. Your see each of them at one time or another. Our room was more than adequate, rather luxurious and comfortable. Bath  Shower looked brand new. The location is probably one of its greatest assets. You can walk to all the must do sights in ten minutes, or less. ATM directly across the street from the hotel. A daily happy hour complimentary from 5 to 7, more than adequate for predinner muchies. Now this all comes at a price that is probably less than half of the more famous hotels, a very great value that I would recommend to all. (and 10% off for cash)

<Content>Amazing Hotel ,Lives up to reviews and Beyond!! Selected this hotel from Tripadvisor for a three day stay with my friend Christine from America . It was a fantastic Hotel, great location, spotless well equipped good sized room,great linen and towels. However, the most special aspect of this Hotel is the Customer Service which is well above some 5 star Hotel I have stayed in. From the intial booking by email and the offers to arrange tours ,restaurants etc to making us welcome and helping us with lots issues from arrival to departure Fabrizio and Tommaso were quite fantastic. The happy hour is so charming and sitting sipping wine with the other guest while receiving confirmation and directons to our dinner reservations was a very stress free experience . I can not highly recommend this hotel enough suffice it to say many thanks to Fabrizio,Tommaso and family for a magical stay in Florence and I will certainly return to Hotel Davanzati.

<Content>Excellent Staff, Accommodations and Location We booked Hotel Davanzati based on the TripAdvisor reviews and can easily recommend this hotel to would-be travelers. The staff were helpful and courteous. While modern, HD still retains some of its Florentine character. Additionally, every effort has been made to make one's stay comfortable. The room was clean, comfortable and came equipped with a complimentary laptop. HD is in a great location - only a few blocks from the Uffizi, Duomo and Ponte Vecchio. Though we welcomed the exercise, the only potential drawback is the fact that climbing stairs is a prerequisite as there is no ground-level elevator.

<Content>Ten Stars! Superb. I am a single woman, no novice to European travel and can say without reservation this is one of the finest hotels in which I've stayed. Fabrizio, his wife and his father were there to greet, all so friendly, so warm, so welcoming. Hotel lovely and nicely appointed. Fabrizio showed me to my room and explained all the amenities of which there are many. They thought of everything.Room was perfect size for one and the bathroom was of sufficient size to dry oneself from the shower without hitting an elbow on the sink. All was absolutely clean, clean, clean. Laptop at no charge and detailed instructions on how get into the internet (don't scoff, not all access is intuitive). Objectional noise inside or out? Plug in the white noise machine (windows are double-paned). Need to make a decision on which walking tour? Fabrizio knows the good one and makes the reservation (oh yes, the tour was terrific). Hotel Davanzati says your comfort is their main concern and teveryone there takes that seriously.

<Content>The Davanzati is divine! We've stayed with Fabrizio and Tommaso at Hotel Davanzati twice now, each time at the end of a DIY rambling Tuscan experience. Each time has been over-the-top for my husband and me. Fabrizio nad Tommaso go out of their way to make you feel like you're coming home to family!The hotel is well located, immaculate and equipped with the latest technology including in-room laptop computers with DVD players. The staff knows Florence and knows what travelers value. They are attentive to every need, from making restaurant and museum recommendations and reservations to hirng and getting us into an early cab to meet an early flight.There's a nightly happy hour at the Davanzati with candlelight, lively music and light hors d'oeuvres (recipe included). It's fun to meet and talk with other travelers to compare notes at the end of the day and get new ideas for the next day.We are happily retired Floridians who will stay at the Davanzati again and again, and heartily recommend it to other travelers to Florence.

<Content>lives up to it's reputation I fly over 100,000 miles per year on business, and probably stay in 30+ hotels each year. My recent trip to Florence was for pleasure. This hotel lived up to all of the reviews posted on tripadvisor. In a phrase, the hotel's owners fully understand the concept of customer service. The hotel's location is absolutely perfect for those visiting Florence on vacation. The room (I rented a suite) was extremely generous in size, clean, and well appointed. At the risk of over-emphasizing my previous statement about the owners, they were extremely responsive, friendly, professional, attentive, and patient with patrons (not just myself). Each guest (regardless of the room they were renting) was treated with an equal measure of care.So long as the current owners are in command, this hotel will remain a safe bet, and extremely good value.

<Content>Great hotel Never having been to Florence, this was a great find. It is right in the middle of the area of Florence with all the attractions - no more than 5 minutes walking from the Uffuzi Museum and the same from the Duomo. There is an outdoor market with leather products, etc. a block away and restaurants everywhere, including a nice one on the same block.Each evening we took advantage of the free cocktail hour and in the morning the free breakfast. The front desk was extremely helpful with baggage storage, wake up call and taxi at 5 am. They are willing to help you with anything you want to do in Florence - they couldn't have been friendlier.At the time we stayed, the Hotel was willing to discount your bill 10% if you paid with cash, which we did.The only two minor challenges - it takes a little looking to find it. The street numbers don't run consecutively so you can't go by them. The Hotel sign is up above the first floor, so just keep looking up. We came in to the city a day before our stay and two of us strolled down the street looking for the hotel and we found it on the first pass. Don't worry about it if you are arriving by taxi - they know. Secondly, there is a flight of stairs (20 or so) to get up to the elevator which takes you up to the second floor reception desk. If you ring the bell at the door on the street level, someone will come down to help you with your bags. It was fine for us, but if you have an impairment it could be a problem.  Our bathroom was modern, with a shower. The room (204) had a double and a twin bed. The room came with a laptop and free access to the internet. The windows have been upgraded to help block street noise and they provide a white noise machine if you need it to help you sleep. We didn't need it. We heard some street noise, but not enough to keep us up. If you're sensitive, ask for a room off the street. Street noise can be a common problem in Florence hotels, so don't let this deter you.We would definitely return and have already referred the hotel to friends traveling later this year.

<Content>Believe The Reviews What can I add? This really is a fantastic place to stay. The hotel staff fall over themselves to help. Polite, curteous and friendly. The hotel has a great location and is clean and well kept. Charming stairs up to a lift takes you to the reception, where, invariably you will be greeted by Fabrizio with a warm handshake.He and his son give great advice for your excursions and dining. Don't know how they keep it up but they do. Well done the Hotel Davanzati Family. Top Marks!!Kevin and LynLondon

<Content>What a Treasure! The Davanzati is a every bit as good as its reputation suggests. It is ideally situated, with close walking proximity to Ponte Vecchio, Republic Square and the many fine restaurants and shopping boutiques characteristic of the locale. It is not easy to find, but worth every bit of effort to do so.The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the in-room laptops are an excellent innovation. The laneways outside can be a bit noisy, but that is part of the attraction and authenticity of the property. The breakfast/evening drinks room is quite small, but then so is the hotel. What makes the property a standout is the service; my wife and I travel extensively, and have never stayed in a hotel where the proprietors willingly and expertly deliver so much to their guests. We booked restaurants and trains through the front desk, as well as a walking tour of the principal attractions...nothing new in that, except that this was done by the owners, who also manage the front desk and back-of-house, provide porterage and guidance services, and still have time to chat, and take a genuine interest in their gusests. Fabrizzio and his team are rightly accorded legendary status in the business; the service just cannot be faulted.We would go back to Florence just to stay in the hotel , though of course there is much to see and do in this great city. Thank you Fabrizzio and Tomasso for delivering an experience beyond expectation...one of simple values and execution, all too often overlooked in larger and more ostentatious properties.

<Content>Best Hotel in Italy!! Fabrizio and his sons were excellent hosts!!! Booked our Uffizi reservations and made us last minute dinner reservations, which ended up being one of the best meals during our stay. The happy hour was just one of the great touches they provide. Our room was great and the service was outstanding! Thank you again Fabrizio for a wonderful stay. We will definitely stay again when our travels bring us back to Florence.

<Content>Simply The Best Hotel in Florence I can not say enough as to how wonderful this Hotel is. When one travels you expect certain things like a clean room, great location, free internet, friendly staff, etc. The Hotel Davanzati certainly has all of the above and so much more. The owner Fabrizio goes above and beyond in making sure that your stay is a memorable one. From the breakfast in the morning, the recommendations for lunch and dinner locations, the whatever I can do to make your stay more enjoyable attitude and the complimentary wine served in the evening you will never and I repeat (never) find a better hotel in Florence.

<Content>Fabulous, friendly hotel It's hard to imagine a better hotel experience than we had at the Davanzati. Extraordinarily friendly staff, good breakfasts, a lovely room, free wi-fi and an excellent shower! Throughout our stay we were made to feel very welcome by this lovely family - Tommaso's restaurant recommendations were perfect, and every evening they provided a drinks party to allow the guests to meet each other. The location couldn't be better and the prices are very reasonable. No wonder it's (currently, anyway) #1 Florence hotel on this website.

<Content>Le ginocchia dell'ape. A cheap short break with budget flights to Pisa and booked this hotel because of the tripadvisor reviews. Was not disappointed: it is worth six blobs. Very centrally located near the Via Tornabuoni for fashionable shops, the ponte vecchio and within easy walking distance of Uffizi. Lots of nice restaurants in the immediate area. The people running it are very helpful without being annoying. The room was a small double, but clean and quiet with an excellent large shower-room, that was also disabled friendly. Breakfast was rather what you would expect in Continental Europe: Continental. The highspot was the 6.30 happy hour. In the dining room they dim the lights, played retro Euro disco music and served free chianti and prosecco with nuts, bread and a delicious salsa dip. The other guests gently sipped their wine and discussed the finer points of renaissance art, while I tested the depth of this largesse by going back, several times, for more. A very happy Happy Hour.

<Content>Friendly and well run hotel. We enjoyed out stay at this hotel. The rooms are clean, the AC worked well, breakfast was plentiful and fresh, there are DVD's and books for your use. The location makes moving around the city easy. Tommaso is a very helpful and helped us with our reservations, restaurant bookings, arranging taxis whatever we required, nothing was too much trouble. The happy hour was a bonus as we were able to speak to other fellow travellers for an hour or so. The only minor issue I had was that our room faced onto an alley that the marketsellers used to store their trolleys which started being rolled past our window at around 4am. We slept with the window open on the first night .After speaking with Tommaso and pointing out our problem he suggested that we keep the window closed during the night which we did and this greatly helped with noise reduction. The windows are also double glazed.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Wonderful hotel. The rooms were very clean and big by european standards. The owner at our request had organised  prebooked a lot of trips for us which meant that we saw a lot of Florence in a short space of time. The hotel is in an excellent location and although we were overlooking the street the noise was not a problem.Fabrizio (the owner) went well out of his way to find ( buy for us) a piece of equipment that we were looking for which saved us a lot of time and effort especially when we were supposed to be on holiday.Can't recommend this hotel enough as we definitely had a great holiday thanks to Fabrizio.

<Content>My favorite little hotel We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during out trip to Italy. We absolutely loved this hotel! The location is excellent being so close to all the major attractions. If you are planning on taking some tours... the ArtViva/Original Florence Walking Tours (a great tour company) is literally steps away from the front door of the hotel. When you arrive at the hotel, you have to climb a flight of stairs to get to the elevator (probably the only negative I can think of). There is a intercom that rings up to the front desk... they will send someone to greet you and help you with your bags. The front desk/lobby area is very inviting. Fabrizio greets you when you walk into the lobby. He is extremely helpful with booking tours and transportation, and can also help with restaurant suggestions. The rooms are very nicely decorated. Each room has a laptop with internet access, a playstation 2 (video games and DVDs can be borrowed for free in the lobby) and a TV with english channels. The bathroom is updated and very clean. The air conditioning is strong.There is a small dining room next to the lobby where a breakfast bar is set up every morning... breakfast includes pastries, rolls, ham, cheese, cereal, yogurt, fruit, juice and coffee. There is also a happy hour every night (we didn't have a chance to go).I thought this was a great hotel... just so pleasant and nice. If I go back to florence, I would definately stay there again.

<Content>OMG - LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it!!!! I am shocked by anyone who didn鈥檛 love this hotel! We went there based on the reviews on Trip Advisor and we LOVED it! From the moment we walked in, Fabrizio and Tommaso made us feel like we were staying with family. They accommodated our every need. Not to mention, the terrific service and immediate response to e-mails before we even left the US was amazing. They answered every little question we had (and we had a ton of questions). The rooms were great and immaculate. The location couldn鈥檛 be better. They provided us with the most amazing restaurant recommendations helped us with tickets and tours and the happy hour was one of the highlights!! After a long day of touring it was so wonderful to come back to the hotel and have great wine and AMAZING bruschetta. It was wonderful to have the laptops in the room with the complimentary internet. It gave us a chance to send e-mails home and share pictures of the trip with our family. We will highly recommend the Hotel Davanzati to anyone that we know going to Florence and we will absolutely stay there again when we return. Thank you Fabrizio and Tommaso for a wonderful experience in Florence.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in the heart of Florence Like many others I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and wasn't disappointed. The hotel is very central making all of Florence accessible. The service from all was fantastic but especially Tomasso and the lovely lady who served at breakfast. The hotel booked Uffuzi tickets for us, recommended and booked meals for us and sorted out the parking of our car all with a big smile and no extra charges. As others have noted there are nice extras like free internet access and the happy hour.Our bed was very comfortable, large by Italian city standards, The room was spotless and we had a room directly on the front street and didn't get disturbed at all. We didn't have any issues with the air con or smells or anything else others have noted. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a stay here.

<Content>Fabulous hotel - we loved everything about it We stayed at Hotel Davanzati in Florence for 11 nights in August/September 2008. We chose it because it was #1 on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. It is a wonderful hotel and I would recommend it to anyone. Can't wait to return.As many other reviewers have pointed out, it isn't 5 star luxury - it is the amazing service that makes this charming family-run hotel so special.We staying in a basic double room rather than a suite, and it was perfect for our needs. The room was large, it had a very comfortable king-sized bed, plenty of storage space, free wi-fi and use of a laptop, functioning air conditioning and it was spotlessly clean. They even provide a noise-muffling machine, although we never used it as the room was very quiet.Breakfast was included in the room rate and was excellent - with a wide selection of breads, croissants and pastries, fresh fruit and fruit juice, ham and cheese. Good coffeee too. The hotel also provides DVDs and games (as well as a good selection of travel guides and books) for the use of guests, although we were so busy enjoying the city that we didn't make use of these.The hotel is very well located, 5 minutes walk to the main sights, but on a quiet road. The service provided by Fabrizio, Tommaso and the rest of the family is amazing. They greeted us by name as we arrived (a great personal touch) and couldn't do enough to help throughout our stay. Before we arrived they had booked for us all our entrance tickets to the museums, plus a couple of guided tours, so we didn't have to queue anywhere, and they booked restaurants for dinner every night. Everywhere we ate was excellent. We also enjoyed their free happy hour - where they encourage guests (the majority of whom are English speaking) to mingle. What could be nicer than sipping a glass (or two) of prosecco and nibbling bruchetta whist chatting with like-minded travellers!We can't wait to return to hotel Davanzati!

<Content>Home Away from Home We only stayed at Hotel Davanzati for two nights, one at the beginning of our trip to Tuscany and the other at its end, but we absolutely loved it! We were extremely impressed with the staff; everyone we encountered made us feel welcome and saw to our requests for museum and dinner reservations, early morning taxis, and an unusual check-out time due to the timing of our flight home. If we ever find ourselves in Florence again, we will definitely stay at Hotel Davanzati.

<Content>loved the service, HATED the smell I really hate to give this place a bad review, but I am very surprised this place is listed #1 on tripadvisor (the reason that we booked). Based on all of the rave reviews, we really thought this might be our favorite place. The service was exceptional (friendly, nice, gave us a laptop with free internet in our room, DVD library and even happy hour each night). HOWEVER, our room was the most pungent, sninky place I have ever been in. It smelled so much that even when I woke up in the morning I hadn't adjusted to it. Even though the other parts were great, for this reason I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Another wonderful stay at my favorite hotel I am a return guest at the hotel, and am never disappointed. For me it's returning to friends, so always a special treat; however, I observe them to provide warm and friendly service to all guests. The service is top notch and Fabrizio and family really know how to make it work. They go out of their way to make guests comfortable and at home, without being intrusive. The Happy Hour is a highlight, and should never be missed. Breakfast is always good, and it's lovely to be greeted with friendly smiles from Patrizia and Sofia. Their capuccinos are the best around. Can't beat the free internet/laptops in the room, just an added bonus and convenience. I strongly encourage you to follow their restaurant recommendations... you'll never go wrong!! I'll continue to return to Florence regularly, and will never lay my head down in another hotel, besides Hotel Davanzati! It continues to earn, and deserve, the #1 ranking...

<Content>Good, but not excellent The Hotel Davanzati is a nice, three star hotel. The service is very good and there are some special touches such as a playstation, computer, and noise machine in the bedroom. The happy hour was fun, with Buddha Bar music in the background, candles, and free wine and bread. It was great to meet fellow travellers and my husband and I were fortunate enough to make new friends with another couple. The breakfast was continental style, with delicious coffee. The location is good, although some hotel guests told me that their rooms were too noisy. The hotel misses on two main points: 1. the bed was not very comfortable and 2. the airconditioning unit in the room could only be adjusted by 3 degrees, so we had to sleep in 26 degree celsius temperatures, and it kept shutting off. A nice trip, but not excellent.

<Content>Favourite I stayed as a single female traveller from oz in April 2008. It was easily my favourite hotel of my European tour, which included some 5 star hotels. I think some reviewers have missed the point, - of course a 5 star hotel is going to be more plush and include a sense of luxury. However, what really makes this place special is the unique and special atmosphere that is created by the exceptional hospitality from the family that own and run the hotel. Fabrizio and Tommaso are truly wonderful hosts, who exhibit extra special hospitality. I arrived particularly hot and bothered after dragging my luggage (I packed way too much) from the train station and was not in a good mood at all. However, this was instantly remedied with Tommaso's warm and genuine welcome.I was shown my room which was clean, bright and well appointed. The laptop in the room with free internet access was a surprise bonus. Whilst some people have mentioned some noise I found that the hotel was quiet and relaxing. The breakfasts were above average with fresh, tasty choices of breads, cold meats, pastries, fruit, cereals and even chocolate cake!The complementary happy hour held in the lobby of the hotel was a great way to relax after a day of sightseeing and as a single traveller it was most appreciated in order to have conversations with fellow travellers from different parts of the world. Tommaso and Fabrizio provided me with all the information I needed to make sure my time in Florence was special and memorable. The restaurant recommendations were fantastic. I was very dissapointed to be leaving after 3 nights. However, after falling ill in Rome and having to delay my flight back home to Australia for a week as a result, I rushed back to Davanzati to recouperate. By the end of my second stay I truly did feel like part of the family and was genuinely touched by the way I was treated by Fabrizio, Tomasso and the rest of the family. It was an experience I will never forget and can't wait to return one day soon.

<Content>It's a Gem We stayed at the Davantzi in late August and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel in downtown Florence. It's within walking distance to all the major sites. We booked directly several months prior to our arrival and during that time had numerous emails w/ Fabrizio and Tommaso regarding our accomodations and booking of museum times. They were both always very prompt in responding to emails and arranged the bookings as requested. Our room was clean and cozy. We booked a single room double bed which was great though just a bit small. The laptop and internet access in the room is a plus. We enjoyed the dining area in the morning for a quick breakfast and cappucino. Also enjoyed the ambiance at night at the hotel with the dim lights, and music playing in the dining area. The hotel is very cozy and has more a feeling of a bed and breakfast than a hotel. Fabrizio made a couple of excellent recommendations to us for restaurants including the Marionne Restaurant (also recommended in Rick Steve's Guide) which was authentic, basic Italian staples and LaBarrola which was near the hotel and had great pizza. The only negative I can think of is that at least in the room we stayed, the walls seemed paper thin as we could hear guests in the room next to us talking in the middle of the night but it was not a major problem. We are planning to return to Florence and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent hotel We stayed at Hotel Davanzati while in Florence on our honeymoon this past July. We booked all our Italy hotels after reading everyone's comments on Trip Advisor so we wanted to make sure to write our own comments to hopefully help others with their selection. This hotel was a great little family owned hotel, excellent service was provided to us every day and whenever needed by both Tomasso and his father and the best part is that they answer their email on a timely basis so they are very helpful in booking tours and giving travelers any information they require prior to their arrival. Also a little bonus part is that if you pay cash, they offer a 10% discount on the rates. Honestly, the hotel is situated in a great area within walking distance to all restaurants, sights and the train station. They have this great little happy hour from 5-7 (I think) where you can sample some great wines and bruschetta free of charge and they are very helpful in general with all requests. I would definitely recommend staying here for a great price and a great experience in Florence.

<Content>Anniversary/Birthday celebration We chose the Davanzati because of the reports on Tripadvisor and we have never been let down using this approach before. Having said that the hotel is good but not as good as painted in previous reports.Its most important selling point is its location 鈥?no more than 5-10 minutes from the Uffizi Gallery, the Duomo, the Ponte Vecchio and all the other main sites. Though on a busy little street opposite the main Post Office the modernization of the hotel, including double-glazing, means that it is quiet and relaxing. Access to the hotel is via steep steps from the street and depending on your room location via a lift to Reception and other floors. We had a Junior Suite for 3 nights, which was comfortable but not luxurious and certainly not of the quality of the Bella Venezia in Venice. (If you pay in cash a generous 10% discount is applied.) In the guest book some previous visitors said that the room and hotel were better than places like the Ritz and other 5 star establishments 鈥?some people clearly get carried away after a few visits to the mini bar! The provision of a laptop was an added bonus if you want to stay in touch with the outside world or to check on opening times of restaurants or key sites to visit as well as to research parts of Florence鈥檚 history.We very much appreciated the copious and friendly guidance from Tommaso via email about local restaurants and tours that can be arranged by the hotel. This was a very special visit for us as it was a surprise combined 24th wedding anniversary and birthday celebration. Consequently, the hotel was booked months in advance and we were guided by Tommaso鈥檚 restaurant advice. On this part we were disappointed because two of the restaurants we chose and thought we鈥檇 reserved via Tommaso were closed for annual holidays (in August/September?) but we were not informed of this until the actual day of our celebration so had to spend some time traipsing around Florence to find an alternative. We were far from impressed. Last year, at the Bella Venezia, we were presented with a bottle of Italian bubbly and wished Sandy a Happy Birthday by the staff 鈥?at the Davanzati nothing was offered.Breakfast, highly rated by previous guests, was pleasant 鈥?some pastries, cereals, bread/toast, yoghurts, cakes, fruit, juice and coffee. We ate at 4 restaurants recommended by the hotel - I 4 Leoni 鈥?good overall, great tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms- Il Ricci 鈥?good for fish 鈥?carpaccio of tuna, swordfish and octopus particularly good, nice setting but averageoverall- Celestino 鈥?for lunch 鈥?great lasagne!- Il Garga 鈥?the best of the lot 鈥?the calf鈥檚 liver was outstanding as was the risotto with asparagus 鈥?lovely atmosphere, chef very attentive and celebrated our special event with a complimentary bottle of wine 鈥?but expensiveBeware, guide prices quoted by the hotel for restaurant prices are conservative 鈥?you鈥檙e normally charged 鈧? each for bread/covers, 鈧?+ for a carafe of water and 12% service charge. It all mounts up!Tommaso efficiently arranged taxis almost to the minute and booked a carriage tour around Florence and a day tour to Lucca, Pisa and San Miniato (鈧?9 per head). The carriage tour was supposed to cost 鈧?0 in total for about 20 minutes but after 26 mins of a lovely tour the driver asked for 鈧?00 which we refused and he accepted 鈧?0. The day tour was great as we had the tour to ourselves and our 鈥榞uide鈥?Paolo, a visual artist, was good with local knowledge and views. This is not a tour, however, where you are guided around the places of interest. You arrive at Lucca and are left to your own devices for 2 hours before meeting up for lunch (included in the cost). This suited us but for others looking for more interaction and information from the guide they would feel somewhat cast adrift. The lunch was a buffet but very good and located in the oldest trattoria in Lucca. We loved Lucca a great deal 鈥?very clean, lovely views from the walls and great buildings and shopping facilities. Each day we returned for the complimentary 鈥榟appy hour鈥?between 1830 and 1930 where nibbles of simple bruschetta, tomato relish and crackers were on offer with prosecco white wine or chianti. A time for guests to mix and catch up on the day鈥檚 events, which was a little difficult as the piped music was far too loud.Overall, we would recommend the Davanzati for its great location, friendly staff and pre-arrival information.

<Content>A true gem Having read the fine reviews for this hotel, we stayed there for three nights in August. This was one of those rare occasions when something not only meets lofty expectations, but exceeds them. The family-owned Davanzati is a true gem. From the moment we arrived --in mid-Happy Hour-- we were delighted by the hotel's warmth, friendliness and efficiency. Tommaso was a gracious host and gave us excellent suggestions for restaurants and tours. The room was very nicely appointed and even included a white noise machine to aid sleep. Bath and shower were modern and efficient. The hotel is spotless. The location is ideal...very short walk to the Duomo, Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio and the main piazzas. We could not have been happier with our choice of the Davanzati. I would also highly recommend the restaurant La Bussola a few steps away from the hotel. If there is fresher and better mozzarella outside of Campania I would be shocked. Bottom line, the Hotel Davanzati rules.

<Content>Fabulous, Friendly Hotel We stayed at the Davanzati the last weekend in August. From the greeting when we arrived to the help with getting to the train station and goodbye's when we left, it was a wonderful experience. The hotel public areas and rooms are lovely; breakfast is good; and happy hour is just the thing after a day of exploring Florence! However, the best part is the care you receive from Fabrizio and Tommaso from the moment you book the reservation and ask for touring help, to check in and out, to dinner and musuem reservations while you are there. It feels like you are staying at a friend's home where they are glad to see you and want you to love their home and city!

<Content>#1 for a reason! There is really nothing I can say that isn't already somewhere in the other 920 reviews!!! Except...everyone else is right. It was a truly wonderful experience! The hotel is perfectly located within short walking distance of the major sites. Getting to the hotel by car is a little challenging given the pedestrian-only streets. However, once we arrived, we were greeted and the car was parked for us.Fabrizio is the owner and host extraordinaire. He made it such an easy process to reserve a room, responded quickly to emails, made reservations for us at the museums as well as had great recommendations on where to eat. The room was wonderful....every detail attended to. Breakfast was tasty. Yet, it is the personal touch that Fabrizio, his family and the staff bring to the hotel that true makes it unique. We even got a picture with Fabrizio to remember the special occasion.....you don't do that at the chain hotels!Tara and Kevin- Atlanta, GA

<Content>As it says on the Tin Is this hotel the best in Florence? It is, of course, impossible for me to say having only visited Florence once and having stayed only in this hotel. However, this is what I can say...I agree with the other reviewers: I think this is a fabulous hotel made fabulous by the care and personal attention that the staff offer. The rooms are clean and neat and modern and have the appeal of a five star luxury hotel. And isn't it great to have free internet access and not have to pay for it as part of yet another hidden cost? Despite being the restaurant holiday season and a busy tourist time, restaurants and tickets were booked and secured gladly on my behalf. It makes such a nice change to stay at a well run, small to medium size hotel, where the staff really look after you, and not get lost in a larger hotel where you're just another number.Does this hotel deserve to be top of the Florence list? Again, it's impossible for me to say having only stayed at one hotel, but it certainly deserves to be there! - and I've stayed at some of the best (and not so best) hotels in London, New York, Paris and Rome. And for the price I paid for it: it was an absolute bargin. If I ever go back to Florence, this is where I'll be staying.

<Content>Loved our stay in Florence The Hotel Davanzati was excellent. The rooms were very nice and the service was more than we could have expected. Tommaso and Fabrizio took care of everything for us - from tours, to dinner reservations, to recommendations on where to go and what to do. Our rooms were cleaned as soon as we left each day. it was great having breakfast provided too. The location was ideal. We cannot say enough about what a positive experience we had in Florence. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Florence!!

<Content>Fatastic Hotel in Florence We stayed at the Hotel Davanzati for 3 days during our honeymoon and it was our favorite hotel. Tommaso and staff were very friendly and helpful. The happy hour is a must! We had glasses of prosecco every night! And the every day breakfast was the best out of all the hotels! We stayed in a small double for 2 nights (it was small, but had a great window, nice bathroom and comfy bed) and a superior double for the last night (more space and view of the front). Also the laptops + playstations in every room is big plus!

<Content>Great Choice We spent three wonderful days from aug 24th until aug 27th 2008 in a great room, my husband, child of twelve and I. The room was big for european standards, with a separation for the child's bed. The bathroom was big and confortable. I had lernt about the hotel from TripAdvisor, and for that reason, I didn't doubt. When we arrived, I got scared because of the outside impression and the stairs for the main lobby, but as soon as we registered, everything was even better than expected: the rooms, the location, the advices for what ever you asked. The family is devoted to their hotel. You wouldn't choose better on your own as easy the restaurants and shops they send you. SHIRLEY, FROM VENEZUELA.SHIRLEYS58@HOTMAIL.COM

<Content>Wonderful Experience During our Italy trip this summer, we stayed at 5 hotels. The Davanzanti was the best. Fabrizio and his team are awesome and take care of everything from reservations for dinner and museums to special room requests. The hotel is very quiet and clean. the location is ideal for sightseeing in Florence. Our favorite aspect of our stay was taking advantage of the happy hour which includes Prosseco and Bruchetta (included in the cost of the room). We had two different rooms, one large and one small. Both were nicely appointed. If you spend more time in a hotel room than we do, you may want to upgrade to the larger room, but we found the regular size room to fit just fine. Overall, this is a fine hotel - you cannot go wrong with this selection for your stay in wonderful Florence.

<Content>Service Unmatched! When planning this trip, it was suggested that we don't stay in Florence but instead somewhere outside of Florence. What a mistake that would have been! The Hotel Davanzati is fantastic - great, safe location, nice, clean hotel with great amenities such as breakfast, happy hour, free movies and in-room internet via their laptops! What really sets it apart, though, is Fabrizio and his staff. They arranged a great tour guide, excellent restaurants etc. but also went so above and beyond to help when I was having trouble accessing funds through the ATMS. Fabrizio really cares about his guests and making their stay a success. I've travelled all over the world and would whole-heartedly recommend this hotel. I don't feel the same way about many of the others we visited this trip. This hotel deserves its #1 status in Florence.

<Content>No reason to stay anywhere else We just returned from a two-week trip to Paris, Rome, Florence, and Assisi. The Hotel Davanzati was one of the highlights of the trip -- and we had stayed at the fabled Westin Excelsior in Rome just before arriving at the Davanzati. Tommaso and Fabrizio are wonderful hosts who immediately make you feel welcome and appreciated. Their suggestions for local restaurants were excellent and they made all our reservations for the museums.Our room was clean, modern, and spacious. The breakfast was nice, and the happy hour with free wine and snacks was delightful. We stayed here based upon the reviews in Trip Advisor, and I can think of no reason to stay anywhere else.

<Content>Perfect wedding and honeymoon! We had a wonderful stay at the Davanzati in May 2008.We were actually getting married in a small tuscan village less than an hour out of Florence but thought Florece was a better base for us and our guests!From the moment we arrived Fabrizio and his son Tomasso looked after us and did over and above the norm to make our stay perfect!The rooms were clean with lovely crisp white bedding! The breakfast was great too, my husband and I never realised croissants could taste so good! They were so fresh and went down well with the lovely cappucinos!Location wise, the hotel is perfect! It's right in the hub of everything! We stayed at the hotel for a week and can't believe we walked past the La Grotta Guelfa restaurant (just along from the hotel on the corner) every night until our last night when we went in and had the best meal of or trip! It's well worth a visit!One top tip, don't hire a car and drive in Florence unless you are CRAZY, never again!!!

<Content>BOOK AND ENJOY! The Hotel Davanzati is a beautiful, chic hotel run by a fantastic family and a top notch staff who are all friendly, courteous and helpful. We were greeted by a smiling porter who led us to a lift that took us straight to reception and a warm welcome by Fabrizio, the hotel owner.After giving us a very informative talk about sights and museums, he showed us to our lovely, airy room. There was a huge bed covered in snowy white bedding, beautiful furniture, a free safe, free laptop and d.v.d. player. The en suite shower room was spotlessly clean and was complete with a powerful hairdryer.The food at breakfast time was delicious and plentiful, and the coffees were extremely good. The wine, music and candlelight in the early evening were a lovely touch. We thoroughly enjoyed our five night stay at the Hotel Davanzati. As we made our way out of reception , Fabrizio helped with our luggage down to the street, bade us a cheerful farewell and smilingly wished us a good journey home. Truly, he is the TOPS!  This hotel is a unique concept on city break hotels, the like of which we have never experienced. Thank you everyone at the Hotel Davanzati. BOOK and ENJOY.Marford Travellers (Wales)

<Content>Amazing hotel. I selected this hotel from it's placing here on TA, and had a positive response when I mentioned it on the forum, which was good enough for me as we were only spending the night in Florence.We arrived into Florence by train, and had no difficulty locating the hotel on foot - despite plenty of luggage and children :)The entrance to the hotel is discrete,(something that must have contributed to the accolade of winning TA's best hideaway location in 2007) and leads up some steps to an elevator, which brings you to reception.We were met by the incredibleTommaso, who is probably the strongest member of any hotel team that I have ever met. This man is a concierge, manager, mind reader all rolled into one! The luggage disappeared, we were given a briefing of the city, and details of our booking at Accademia Gallery were passed along, and we then went to our rooms, which were two interconnecting rooms, with access to a patio.The rooms were very classical Italian (yet fully modern), pristine, shining bathrooms - all the latest technology, and very comfortable.The public areas are furnished in the same way, with occassional tables filled with guide books, fiction and DVDs.It's only when you walk out of the hotel that you realise what a fantastic location you've choosen - the Duomo just a short strollaway.We made our way through some of the sights, returned for a shower - and Tommaso mentioned 'happy hour', which we thought we'd miss - not something that springs to mind when you're with children.However, as we called into the reception the music was a draw, and we had a glass (or two:) of Prosecco, while my son befriended two American ladies who had similar travel plans to ourselves, and made for a great half an hour.We crossed over the square and ate at the local restaurant (recommeded by Tomasso) which was another success.Next morning we checked out effortlessly, and got into a taxi for a short tour of some of the places that we missed like Ponte Vecchio  Piazza Michelangelo - again, all effortlessly (well seemingly!) organised by Tomasso.Yes - we would look no further on any future trip to Florence than the Davanzati!

<Content>The Hotel Davanzati IS Florence This small, tasteful, family run hotel is right in the centre of Florence, just around the corner from the Piazza della Signoria and only five minutes' walk from the Ponte Vecchio. It is on a quiet side street, and the rooms are comfortable and inviting. What makes the hotel easy to recommend is the service. Fabrizio and his wife, father, son and staff cannot do enough for their guests. Fabrizio booked last-minute tickets for the Uffizi Galleries for me and I was able to walk straight in while everyone else waited in line for at least an hour. He knows every restaurant in the city and has a good sense of the type of restaurant a guest will enjoy and be able to afford. Every evening at 6:30 there's happy hour in the small dining area (which is also the breakfast room), with free red wine, Prosecco, and nibbles, where you'll meet fellow guests and exchange tips about what to see and do in and around the city. The continental breakfast is delightful and relaxing. This is a very romantic hotel, so I would recommend it for couples, but it's also perfect for families. My 9-year-old daughter was delighted with the large selection of DVDs and PlayStation games that the hotel offers for kids. I will definitely return to this hotel when I'm next in Florence.

<Content>Fantastic hotel Our family (two adults, 18 year old son and 16 year old daughter) recently stayed at the Hotel Davanzati for two nights during our vacation to Italy. We had booked the deluxe junior suite and were amazed at the fantastic accommodations. both kids had their own loft areas (one with a double bed, the other a single bed loft) and my husband and I had a queen sized bed in a private area (with a sliding door for privacy) just outside the living room. there were two luxurious bathrooms as well. we loved the attentive service. Thomaso arranged tours of the city for us before we arrived and made restaurant reservations for us each night (we loved both restaurants: The Four Lions and Acqua al2). I looked forward to the happy hour where we relaxed with a bottle of wine and delicious snacks. The location of the hotel was perfect. We were able to walk to all the major sights within 10 minutes or less. We loved this hotel!

<Content>Amazing Hotel !!! My husband and I stayed at this hotel during our trip to Italy for our anniversary. There is not enough time or adjectives to describe how wonderful our stay was! We were immediately treated like family from the first moment upon entering this lovely place. This family truly prides themselves on making your vacation one that you will never forget. They made museum reservations for us so we did not have to wait in huge lines. They also recommended the most wonderful restaurants for us to eat at. They go way above and beyond to take care of any need. We can't wait to go back.  Look no further this is the place to stay in Florence. It will be everything that you want...location, comfort, food, and romance!

<Content>Terrific Hotel My partner and I had an amazing time in Florence and this was aided by a wonderful stay at the Hotel Davanzati.The manager Fabrizio was absolutely outstanding in ensuring that we had a comfortable stay at his hotel, and attended to all our specific needs.Fabrizio's knowledge of Florence is superb and he advised us meticulously with regard to where to eat and which sites to see. He also helped us to book tickets to the Accademia and Uffizi gallery, as well as meal reservations for the restaurants we went to.The Hotel Davanzati in our opinion should be awarded five stars for the care and attention they gave to us on our holiday. We will definitely be back and would recommend this hotel to anybody planning a holiday to Florence.

<Content>Perfect stay I just returned from Italy and my stay at this hotel was by far the best. You simply do not get the same service at any of the other hotels, especially in Italy. Not only are the rooms spotless and the breakfast and happy hour very nice, but they booked all of my tours (last minute at my request), reservations at museums, they made recommendations for great restaurants (I am still raving about the food and wine I indulged in) and even booked my train ticket. I stayed in 5 different hotels in Italy this time and all of the others were ranked high by tripadvisor, but none of them came close to the service offered by this hotel. The added touches are unbeatable.

<Content>Stop looking for Hortels in Florence - JUST BOOK DAVANZATI! This hotel, and the people who make it a home-away-from-home, was the high point of our 3 week Italy trip. We took our two daughters (older) and they loved it as well. Family run, Hotel Davanzati is about the finest example of hospitality that I have run into in over 40 years of world travel. Fabrizio (your host) is a genius at helping you with whatever you need! We took the plunge and rented a car for some side trips (Pisa, Lucca, Chianti wine region, Sienna, etc.). We had been warned that having a car might be troublesome, but Fabrizio made it so easy. Each day, we just pulled the car up to the curb in front of the hotel, and a private company whisked the car away to parking garages unknown. Each morning, when we came down to breakfast, the car magically reappeared at the curb. (Of course we did pay 20 dollars or so per day for this service, but it is indispensible if you decide to rent a car.) If you do rent a car GET THE GPS. I don't care what big city you are from, you will NOT be able to get into or out of Florence without the GPS unit. It saved us HOURS. The roads are large and well maintained, the drivers in Tuscany competent and courteous. But back to the hotel - the food was great. I guarantee you will be spoiled by the staff. The rooms were the larget we had in Italy, and the unique character of each room makes it feel like you are living in a large mansion instead of a hotel. The location is stellar. There are more restaurants in stumbling distance than you could eat at in a month. There are probably 8 Gelaterias in a three block radius. You are so close to all the sights that it will take you 5-10 minutes or less to walk to most of them. If you decide to stay somewhere else in Florence, you are going to miss out one one of the highlights of a lifetime!

<Content>We LOVED the Hotel Davanzati!! I traveled to Florence with my 19 year old daughter and had the good fortune of being recommended to the Hotel Davanzati. From my initial contact , through out our entire stay, our experience was absolutely fabulous!

We even got to meet other families during the hotel's candle - lit happy hour, which we enjoyed every day. We truly look forward to returning to the Hotel Davanzati, and would recommend it to anyone traveling to Florence. It is a beautiful property, in a great location, run by a wonderful family.

<Content>Above and beyond As I was checking out, Fabrizio said he had a special song for me... I was confused for a moment until Happy Birthday started playing throughout the lobby. A great start to my 30th year! Fabrizio had noticed the date on my passport when I checked in - it's this attention to detail that you'll find throughout your stay. I arrived without any museum reservations and Fabrizio promptly took care of everything. The restaurant and sightseeing recommendations were great - the room could not have been more comfortable (massive bathroom; great duvet and bed linens; laptop in room; immaculately clean) - and the location is ideal. If they have availability, absolutely choose this hotel. Contrary to some others, I thought the happy hour events were a sweet idea but a bit awkward - but the breakfast is fantastic.

On both occasions the hotel has been superb in every way, from the excellent service of the family-owners through to the spotlessness of the rooms. The facilities are top-notch and it really is a pleasure to stay at this hotel. Returning from a lovely day in the city of Florence, there is no better place to come back to. The family will do anything in their power to assist you with any problems or enquiries that you may have. All in all, taking price into consideration, this is by far the best hotel that I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. I only returned home yesterday, yet I can't wait to return!

<Content>Best for the money I first stayed in this wonderful hotel right after it re-opened 5 years ago. The facilities were top notch and service was magnificent. I was so impressed with the owner and his family and the way they treated me (like family) that I decided to book them on my next trip, which was in July 2008. This time I had a group with me that required 4 singles and one double. They were absolutely delighted with my choice for them. One of our party suffered from extreme exhaustion while we were touring one of the museums and I took her back to the hotel for rest. Even though we had already checked out, Tommaso let her re-use her room for half a day and would not hear of our paying anything extra. All the kudos you have read about this hotel are true. If you can book them for your next trip, you should do it

<Content>Look No Further! If you are staying in Florence, you can stop looking for a hotel, and immediately book your room at the Hotel Davanzati! There are not enough words for me to write in this review to describe how incredible our stay there was this past May. The hotel staff was outstanding! I didn't feel like I was staying at a hotel - I felt like I was staying with close friends. Fabrizio and Tommaso were available to help with any and every need and might just be the greatest hosts I have ever had in a hotel. Hotel Davanzati is perfectly located and is within a short walk of every major site and place you would want to be in Florence. Their restaurant recommendations were perfect and their directions around town were flawless. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Hotel Davanzati! I know we will be staying there every time we are in Florence.

<Content>Loved the Davanzati I can only agree with all of the positive reviews about the Davanzati. I stayed at the Davanzati for two nights in July. I have visited Italy many times and staying at the Davanzati was a truly wonderful experience. Fabrizio welcomed me like an old friend, greeting me by my first name. Fabrizio and Tomasso are warm, friendly and charming. As requested, Fabrizio had arranged a voucher for the Uffizi so that I could collect the ticket the following day and save time queuing. Fabrizio informed me that the gallery was open until 10.00 pm that evening and I should try around 7.00 pm when it would not be busy. I went to the gallery at 8.00 pm and I almost had the gallery to myself. My room was clean, spacious and quiet and the laptop (with free internet access) and DVD player was greatly appreciated. Happy hour between 6.30 and 7.30 each day (with free prosecco, Chianti and nibbles) was a good opportunity to meet other guests. The Davanzati is close to the Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio and the Duomo and the other attractions are within walking distance.As a frequent visitor to Italy, I hope to return to Florence soon and will stay at the Davanzati.

<Content>Davanzati made our stay! From the first email contact I had with Tomaso, I knew that I was in good hands. He and his father Fabrizio made every effort to make our stay in Florence wonderful. The hotel is in the middle of the city and puts everything within a 15 minute walk. The room was clean, big, airconditioned and perfect. I can't tell you how helpful Fabrizio and Tomaso were. They made our museum reservations (even adding one when we forgot to ask) and they're restaurant suggestions were spot on. We found it on this site and it's earned it's number 1 rank. Very reasonably priced. We'd recommend it to any of our friends going to Florence.

<Content>Staying with "Family" My wife and I recently stayed with Tommaso, Fabrizio, and family for two nights. What a great place. We really enjoyed the happy hour concept - it allowed us to meet fellow travelers. A lap-top in every room - you don't get that at the most big name hotels. Service outstanding from restaraunt recommendations to help with tours and taxis. We would absolutely stay there again. You can tell the family loves what they do. There's a lot to be said for staying in a hotel that is family-owned. We felt like we were staying in their home. Florence is a wonderful place to visit - and we were close to everything!

<Content>Fantastic hotel; outstanding service, excellent location Hotel Davanzati is in an excellent location, just 10-15 minutes walk from the station and very close to major attractions like the Duomo, Galleria dell'Accademia, Galleria degli Uffizi, etc. However, the excellent location is nothing compared to the service. Right from the moment we arrived we were completely looked after, excellent restaurant recommendations, museum reservations made, even free DVD rental when we wanted to escape the heat and crowds for a while. Our room was lovely, immaculately clean and very comfortable. When we return to Florence we would not even consider staying anywhere else. This hotel really deserves its number one position.

<Content>We LOVED Hotel Davanzati We loved hotel Davanzati. It's close to everything, the rooms were great, breakfast was the best of any other hotel we stayed in during our vacation in Italy, but what made this hotel experience great for us was Fabrizio! Never have I had better service. He made sure every detail was explained and nothing left to chance. We stayed in a Deluxe Junior suite and it was great for two adults and two teenage kids (18 and 17, boy and a girl). Free laptop and Internet service in the room, air conditioned, flatscreen TVs in every room, 2 full baths with hot showers were great, very friendly staff and great service at breakfast. When we return to Florence we will stay here again.

<Content>Absolutely fantastic We have just returned from our trip to Tuscany of which 3 days were spent in Florence at the Hotel Davanzati. I relied completely on the reviews from TripAdvisor when making my choice of hotels in Florence and it was absolutely excellent. There is no more that I can say except that my picky husband and two teenagers can't wait to return!

<Content>Perfetto.... Surely this should be kept secret as nothing this good should be advertised too much ........Well this has to be the best option around for most people ......perfectly located within minutes of the centre, the Uffizzi and the Duomo. The hotel is very welcoming and Fabrizio and Tomasso make your stay very easy with all the useful information you could ask for . The rooms are perfect , the beds comfortable , Dvd , laptop and PS2 , the list is endless and then.........at 6.30 the lights are dimmed and happy hour commences where you are invited to join other guests to taste bruschetta with the hotel's own trademark sauce, prosecco and music .We have stayed in a few hotels around the world but this is one that will remain a very pleasant memory.Xx

<Content>Service, service, service We stayed at Hotel Davanzati for 3 nights during a 10 day trip to Florence and Tuscany. We found this hotel through tripadvisor and the reviews speak for themselves. No need to repeat what everyone has already said, but we couldn't have been happier with our choice to stay here. The hotel is beautiful, but what really puts it over the top is the service. Fabrizio and Tomosso are friendly and warm and are more than happy to make all of your reservations for you, from dinners to museums. (And definitely take advantage of this for the museums ahead of time - we walked right into all the major ones while others waited on lines of 4+ hours.) All of their suggestions were top notch - definitely try the pizza at the restaurant on the corner diagonally opposite the hotel. It was the best pizza we had the whole trip!

<Content>Best hotel in our trip! We've been to Florence and stay at Davanzati Hotel for 2 nights.The location is great, next to everything, from shopping street to Duomo. And the most wonderful thing was the service attitude of all staffs that we really impressed. The check in is done in 3mins! just get in there and tell our booking name, then he take us to the room immediately.Also the DVD, note book+Wifi+PS2 provided in room was great. The suggestions are very useful from the lovely cafe directions to the delicious restaurant and don't forget their booking service that allowed us to cut the queue to see David at the Accademia and The mall Outlet pick up service!The wonderful stay here made our further nights in other hotels look inferior :-)We'll come back soon!

<Content>Favorite Hotel Ever There is not much to add to what everyone has already said about this incredible hotel in my favorite city. The location is perfect (convenient yet quiet); the rooms are spotless and modern -- with laptop, 2 flat TVs, movies, playstation 2, 120V outlet,....; and service is the best we ever experienced (way better than 4 seasons and Peninsulas that we have stayed at).This would be a very fine hotel even if their service was only OK, but that is not the case. Fabrizzio, Tommaso, et al are absurdly helpful and just incredibly enjoyable to talk to. They reserved Uffizi and the David, restaurants, and other general suggestions. We rented a minivan to drive Tuscany and then leave to go up to Venice and beyond. It was trivial. They reserved the car. I pulled in front and my family boarded and we were on our way. When we returned, I pulled the car right up to the hotel on its very quiet street and just handed them the keys. (A minivan is obviously not recommended however; people were giggling at me parallel parking a minivan on the streets of Florence.)Overall, great value for an incredible hotel. The only minus I can think of is the one most commonly listed which is the stairs but as a family without any handicapped people, it was not a problem for us -- besides, the staff was incredibly quick and helpful at taking the bags. We just returned home, and I already can't wait to revisit the place. Overall, our favorite hotel we ever stayed at.

<Content>The whole package I stayed at the Hotel Davanzati for 4 days and absolutely loved it! The room was beautiful and the service outstanding. The breakfast buffet in the morning was a great way to start the day -- I still miss the cappuccinos. The most surprising part was how the lobby/breakfast room transformed to a lounge at around 5 pm each night. They dim the lights, light candles, play lounge music, and the cappuccino bar becomes a prosecco bar! It was a great way to gather our group before heading out for dinner and a night in Florence and also gave us a chance to socialize with other people staying at the hotel.

<Content>Love Love Love Hotel Davanzati What a wonderful hotel in the heart of Florence. My teenage son also loved the hotel. Fabrizio was wonderful with arranging a beautiful room. My son has asthma and allergies, and this hotel was perfect because it was immaculate, and no carpet . Loved the happy hour...the davanzati sauce is excellent. It is so close to Ufizzi, and even walked to Accademia. Excellent restaurant directly across the street. We will definitely be backThank you again!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>"the cloud' We stayed at the chic Davanzati for 5 nights in mid June. Our stay was enjoyable ,enchanced by polished and friendly service . Our room was spacious and nicely decorated and in tune with the historical nature of the hotel. I especially liked the crisp but puffy bed other wise known as the cloud.The housekeeping is as spotless as the service.We had received good service from Fabrizio and the Team via e-mial about tours etc. so we came totally prepared. The information provided about transportation proved invaluable.The breakfast was fresh tasty and ample, we truly enjoyed the extra capuccinos. The happy hour was a nice touch, bartender ,prosecco and crostini. A good time to exchange travel stories with fellow guests especially the driving in Florence stories.The location is central and very walkable to the major sites. If time allows strive to cross over one of the many bridges that cross the Arno ,as tourist crowds are thinner on that side. We particularily have fond memories of the day we spent in the gardens of the Boboli and the Bardini {I think}. These gardens had great views of the city of Florence from a number of quiet terraces.Overall the Davanzati is a great little place and deserves the wonderful reviews it consistently receives.

<Content>Great Hotel in Florence We stayed at the Hotel Davanzati for five nights in June and had a very nice time. Everyone who works there is pleasant and helpful, especially Fabrizio, who was quite generous with his time.The hotel is in a wonderful location, literally next door to the Palazzo Davanzati, a 10-minute walk to the main train station. One caution about the hotel...as other reviewers have pointed out, reception is up a fairly steep flight of stairs. We had a superior room that was comfortable and spacious. It has a separate area with a sofa and flat-screen TV. The rooms all have a laptop that is free for guests, a very nice feature. The bathroom was good sized and had nice amenities.Breakfast is served in a pretty room across from reception. That's also where happy hour is available to guests each evening. The continental breakfast was perfect for our needs, with a nice variety of fruit, cereals, breads, etc. and excellent cappucino, espresso, etc.We highly recommend the Hotel Davanzati.

<Content>Wife's 40th Birthday Spent 3 fantastic days in Florence for my wife's birthday. The Hotel is ideally situated, the room was excellent and the Hotel Staff extremely helpful. Fabrizio and Tommaso recommended and booked excellent local restaurants which made for a very easy and relaxing stay.Would also thoroughly recommend a self driven trip around Florence in a 1960's Fiat 500 organised by the 500 Touring club.

<Content>Great Hotel and Location We loved this hotel, and as other reviewers indicated, Fabrizio and Tomasso were great hosts. Amenities were great - DVD player/DVD library, happy hour with wine and snacks, tour booking assistance, restaurant recommendations, etc. Room and bath were lovely. Only negative was the expense...but we were there during a Annual Fashion Conference. The location cannot be beat! It's two blocks from the Uffizi and main piazzas.

<Content>Friendly Service Made this our favorite hotel in Italy! My husband and I stayed at the Davanzati in May for 4 nights as part of a 2 week trip around Italy. As many others have written, this hotel rightfully holds their #1most recommended spot. Fabrizio and Tomasso are so friendly that they take a very clean and comfortable hotel in a good location and make it EXTRAORDINARY.5 min walk to Ponte Vecchio10-15 min walk to Duomo15-20 min walk to Academia (overrated - get reservations thru Davanzati - would NOT have been happy if had waited 3 hours in line)10 min walk to Uffizi (also reserve in advance thru D.)To expand a bit on the happy hour - it occurs between 6:30 and 7:30pm. They dim the lights, and light candles and serve free wine and bread. After that, pretty much everyone goes to talk to the front desk to get their restaurant reservation info for the evening.The one issue we had was arriving in Florence on a busy Saturday afternoon IN A CAR. I don't recommend it. There wasn't anywhere to park the car to wait for the garage attendant. This was pretty stressful. Of course, every other day there were plenty of spots outside the hotel so you'd probably be fine on a weekday. It IS difficult to drive through the narrow streets however - and we're pretty adventurous drivers having rented cars in London and Australia.Enjoy your trip to Florence - can't wait to go back (and would definitely stay at the Davanzati again!)

<Content>Wonderful Family Boutique Hotel Fabrizio and his family extended us the warmest welcome we experienced in Italy. Their lovely hotel is sooo central, beautifully decorated, clean and leaves nothing to be desired.The rooms are tastefully furnished, comfortable with all the mod cons including the handy use of a note book computor. The bathroom is modern with every luxury.Breakfast, although continental, is tasteful, healthy and plentiful. Lovely freshly brewed coffee or tea is ever ready.Fabrizio and son Tomasso man the desk every day providing guests with the latest and most reliable tourist information, taxi service and restaurant information. If you advise them in advance they will arrange tickets for any place of interest, you so desire.Every evening the hotel arranges their own free happy hour where guests can mingle, enjoying local wine and savouries.Don't worry about the twenty or so steps up from the street, it is good for the figure after the great Italian food experienced in Florence. Mille grazie!!!, Roberta  Kel

<Content>a gem in florence what a gem! very friendly and welcoming and within walking distance of all the sights. Dell laptop free in our room and a white noise machine. some reviews have commented on the noise from the street in the evenings but we had no problem at all. large rooms, brilliant airconditioning and fantastic recommendations for restaurants. Tommaso recommended a superb fish restaurant just south of the river ricci's. well worth a visit. if you are looking for jewellery don't look on the ponte vecchio(for tourists)- there is a brilliant jewellers just down the road from the hotel. only drawback is the entrance to the hotel - blink and you miss it! lso have to climb stairs to get to reception but would still recommend it

<Content>A Wonderful Stay The Hotel Davanzati, in the heart of Florence, was a truly wonderful 4 night stay. Before even arriving, Fabrizio and Tommaso offered all sorts of help and recommendations by email on what/how to do things in Florence. Our suite was great, simple and comfortable, with a balcony perfect for relaxing after a long day and sipping a little Chianti with the stars overhead. The family and staff were always ready - and able - to quickly get us reservations at the in demand restaurants. The Davanzati is intimate, personable, charming. We'll be back!

<Content>How it should be done! A week after returning from a three day break in Florence staying at Hotel Davanzati with my daughter we are already planning our return. We booked after reading all the positive comments and its easy to see why people are so complimentary about this hotel. Perfect location, impeccable service, amazing hospitality. The family make you feel like a very welcome house guest. Do take advantage of their considerable knowledge of the city, particularly when advising on dinner reservations, their recommendations were spot on.If only all hoteliers could spend some time at this hotel to see how it should be done. Nothing too fancy or flashy, just quiet Italian charm. I will be recommending this hotel to family and friends so if you can get a reservation take it while you can!

<Content>Couldn't ask for more My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon in Italy, of which we spent 5 nights at the Davanzati Hotel, centrally located in Florence. I can't say enough about the expert service and professional attitude of the family-run business. They made excellent restaurant suggestions after getting to know our likes and dislikes, and even made plans for us to have a wine-tasting day trip to Chianti. The room was simple and roomy and spotless. They host an evening happy hour of sorts where people go from 6:30-7:30 for complimentary snacks and prosecco- a really nice touch. Breakfast is also well done, convenient, and delicious. The staff is courteous, helpful, and kind, and I would highly recommend a stay at the Davanzati.

<Content>AMAZING Hotel and Staff!!!! My family and friends just returned from a 2-week Italy vacation. We had the wonderful experience of staying at this amazing hotel for two nights. After researching travel books and Trip Advisor several months ago, we selected Hotel Davanzati based on the tremendous reviews for the location, accommodations and above all customer service. Our expectations were set very high from the beginning, and our stay there far exceeded those expectations.My family had the pleasure of staying in the amazing new suite which sleeps 7 people. It was very large and modern with two large bathrooms, flat screen televisions, Dell laptop, etc. It was perfect for our stay and allowed us to relax at night in a beautiful and quiet environment. The morning breakfast was delicious and a great start to our day. Their nightly happy hour was so enjoyable and relaxing after a busy day of sightseeing.Besides the location and accommodations, the customer service provided by Fabrizio, Tommaso and their entire family was outstanding - the BEST I had ever experienced at any hotel in the US and Italy! They helped us to book the Accademia, Uffizi and Tuscany Tour in advance, plus also a private transfer from the Milan airport to our first destination in Bellagio. Our dinner reservations were made before our arrival, and the meals at the recommended restaurants were superb. We especially loved the pear filled ravioli at 鈥?Leoni鈥? We are already excited to come back to Florence for a longer visit in the future. We would never stay anywhere but the Hotel Davanzati. Our friends traveling to Florence in the future are planning to stay here as well based on our recommendations. If you are traveling to Florence in the future, book the Hotel Davanzati now and look forward to an amazing experience!!!Galasso family and friends, Naperville, IL
