<Content>Most modern hotel ever visited Using the Schiphol website I looked for a hotel that was close enough so I could walk to the gate the next morning, as I had to leave very early. This hotel was one of the few that was nearby. It was easily located, due to the signs in the airport as well as the lighted awning leading to the hotel. The hotel is completely automated, which gives a unique experience, and although it has a cyberpunk feel to it, it is in a friendly kind of way. Everything in the room can be adjusted using touch panels or other electronics, or even via the website before booking. The bed is huge, and the shower is oddly transparent (the restroom, fortunately, isn't).

<Content>Groovy Baby - Perfect Airport Hotel for the Jet Set This is a great hotel at the airport for advanced travelers. Very Austin Powers. Rooms are very small and best for one or for two people very comfortable with each other in all senses of the word. Not much privacy for showering and other functions but the bed is excellent and so is the entertainment system. 3 minute walk to the AMS airport building which is a shopping mall with food, movies, a big grocery store and everything you need. 15-20 minute train ride to AMS central station. If you are at all conservative in your ways, don't stay here. But if you are a funky easygoing traveler, you'll dig it.

<Content>High Tech Room We had a 20 hour layover in Amsterdam and Citizen M was perfect. The staff was wonderful. The room was like nothing we had ever stayed in before. The rooms are tiny - like in New York City but it seems spacious and very cleaverly put together. Enjoyed every minute of our stay. It is a short walk to airport and train station. FABULOUS!

<Content>Brilliant designer hotel for the savvy traveller Citizen M is a new concept in designer hotels. Everything has been designed with maximum efficiency in mind. The rooms are all the same size and come with a massive bed, which takes up one end of the room and a circular shower with mood lighting that changes colour. Everything in the room is controlled from a console. It's really cool, you can get on demand movies (for free), a massive no. of tv channels, and you can control the lighting and music according to your mood or activity. There is free wi-fi, but if you don't have your own laptop, there is are huge apple screens with free internet in the lounge.Check in and out is done via terminals - this is really quick and easy and there are no queues. This means there is no need for a check-in desk, thus saving space and money. Everything is done with a sense of humour, but it's not pretentious or snooty in any way.The service was excellent. There was always a roaming smiling face to help me or answer any questions I had.The lounge area is fantastic. There is a good selection of quality (but pricey) snack food (no restaurant) and a series of areas to chill out with amazing designer furniture and a library of art and design books. The only thing is that it feels a bit like a designer furniture store showroom as apparently this is where the hotel designers get to show off their line of furniture. It's so comfortable, I was tempted to hang out there all day!The hotel is located at the airport, but is only a 15min ride to the central station. This is why the hotel is such great value for money and is a fraction of the cost of a similar standard hotel in the centre.

I loved the technology and spent too long fiddling with all the room options! The check-in process is good too, no hassle at all and very quick.

<Content>Citizen Magnificent! After 2 weeks in Amsterdam, we stayed our last night at Citizen M for an easy early morning departure. It was fantastic! The hotel is literally a 5-minute walk from Schiphol (as we were leaving, my boyfriend realized he had left something in the room as we were about to go through customs - I got a cup of coffee, and by the time I had finished it, he was back). The hotel itself is very hip and comfortable. Automated check-in is easy. The lobby area is beautifully decorated, and there's a great bar/deli for food and drinks. The room was fabulous! Small but well-laid-out. The bed was comfortable, the room remote fun to use, and the shower and toilet easy (if different). My only complaint (and it wouldn't stop me from staying here again) was that there was a little less privacy in the toilet than I'm used to. It's in a little glass pod, and you can pull a curtain to block you from the bed area - but if you're back-lit, someone can still see  hear you from the bed. I wouldn't stay here for my whole Amsterdam trip (why have a 20-minute commute from the city), but it would be a great place to stay on arrival or for departure.

<Content>best Value for money with comfort Although the room is small but the hotel is great. It can be termed as wash and change room. Do remember to take the EXIT A of the Airport and you cannot miss it so just do not worry about finding it . The entire route is covered from top so you will be protected from Rain or Snow However not from wind chill. No issues with the hotel. It is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Free movies are great and the adult movies are also free of charge. You can call the entire world from the phones in the room and its dirt cheap (VOIP). Overall great value for money in Amsterdam where you pay 40 Euros for staying in a dorm. You can eat the food in the airport itself as its a 2 minute walk. Mood pad is great. it is one of its kind so can be an attraction at Amsterdam. Worth staying once. it is at par with a 5 star hotel except for the size of the room. You will get a soap and shower gel and lot of towels. Ok for singles and for couples who can see each other naked :-)))

<Content>Perfect fit for an overnight stay. I was in AMS for 24 hours and the hotel was perfect for my needs. A short walk from Schipol and the train station which links you to downtown in 10-15 minutes. The staff is very friendly and were kind enough to answer my 20 questions about the hotel and the city. At less than half of the price of the other two walkable airport hotels, it is simply a bargain you should not pass up.

<Content>Questionable Practices... CitizenM is ideally located. It's a 2 mins walk from Schipol terminal and walking distance to anywhere else in the Schipol area. I arrived for work and was nice to be able to walk to and from office every day.Checkin is efficient and staff are helpful. Room was nice and clean and well presented. It's a modern layout, but works well.A few niggles - the moodpad kept tripping out and didn't stay charged very long. Eventually I dumped it and used remote control for telly instead. Shower is OK, don't particularly like the overhead option and you can't move it. Pressure wasn't great either.No ironing facilities in the hotel...but if you ask they'll let you use the hotel iron in the back of house. It would have been nice to have a properly set up ironing room for guests to use. People need to iron.Food and drink options are limited and pricey. Staff on this area were not usually the most efficient, often prefering to chat amongst themselves and finish conversations before attending to customer.My advice for food and drink is to head into the airport terminal. There's a Starbucks 3 mins walk from the hotel and other reasonably priced options in the terminal.The lobby area is nicely laid out for watching telly, using computers etc. On a high note - movies are free and there's complimentary wifi, which is very welcome and forward thinking.Worst problem was the questionable practice of charging customers for not staying at the hotel...yes really. In my niaivity I booked the flexible rate I assumed that would mean I could be flexible with my booking. But apparently not. ! was booked for 5 nights, but at the last moment I got notice that a meeting had been cancelled - great home to family a bit earlier. When I went to check out they said that they had to charge me for the 5 night even though I wouldn't be staying as I hadn't given them 24hrs notice. Despite protest I was told to email reservations. I emailed, but unfortunately noone bothered to reply.So, keep this in mind if staying at the hotel...it's not really flexible in the normal sense of the term. I'd have given the hotel a 4 or 5 star review if I hadn't felt so ripped off upon leaving, great trip spoit by questionable business practices.Oh, a word about the website style over substance. It's hard to get information from it.

<Content>A glimpse of the future A stay at the CitizenM gives a feeling of living a little ahead of time, a glimpse of the future....Extra points for design, although I prefer the 'old' way of turning on my shower. Towels were excellent and generously many.Check in and check out was easy. The staff are few but sufficient and very friendly and helpful. Traditional goodies on the check in desk at St. Nicholas was a cool treat that I appreciated. Thanks!Plusses: the huge, comfortable bed with a generous amount of pillows.The free internet access and available computers downstairs.The free movies on tv. GREAT!!A big minus for the room being so cold even when preference on the moodpad was set to the highest possible. Had to use the hairdryer to get some much needed warmth, being chilled down after a long travel. All over impression: GOOD! Great location, walking distance to the airport.Very suitable for practical use when traveling, also with children, less suitable for romance or luxury pampering..All in all I would say this hotel is good value for money and can be recommended.

<Content>Unique, Fun, Tiny Husband and I stayed at the CitizenM on our last night in Amsterdam in order to be close to the airport for our morning flight. This would definitely not be a place to stay while touring the city, but it's great when you need to be near the airport. The price was great, too. On arrival we stepped inside and encountered a bank of computers to check ourselves in. It was quick and easy, but there was staff nearby to assist if we needed it. I'd seen pictures of the room, so I wasn't surprised by its size. I liked the shower and toilet compartments, though the shower leaked a bit. The floor is not carpeted, which I found odd but perfectly fine. The bed is wall-to-wall at the end of the room, which was fun, but a little challenging when sleeping two in the bed since someone has to climb over the other. Other reviewers have complained about the gimicky remote controls for the lights, tv, music and window blinds, but I thought it was really nifty. I had a lot of fun with it. I couldn't dim the lights with it, though -- I had to choose a theme to get dimmed lights. The tv had a multitude of channels in several European languages, which was also fun. The room was very well soundproofed. I didn't hear neighbors or airplanes. The window blinds blocked light very well, too. Downsides: the bed was quite hard. The bedside tables were small, but they did have reading lamps and electrical plugs nearby. There was no luggage tray, only one chair, and no desk or other place to write or use a laptop. The shower has no place to set your own things and the rain shower is too weak to properly rinse with. (I used the handheld instead, which was very good.) There are no washcloths. The bathmat is slippery on the smooth floor. The electronic control unit lit up brightly when we put it in its charging cradle, which disturbed our sleep. We covered it, but discovered the next morning that if we had removed it from its cradle it would have gone dark. I didn't get to spend much time in the lobby lounge, but it looked pretty cool. I loved the mod decor, the laptop/work desks, and the couches and chairs. We got some snacks from the canteen, which was a little overpriced, but no worse than typical vending machine markup. Fresh croissants, light sandwiches and pudding cups were far better than typical candy bar and potato chip fare, though! I was worried about walking to the airport, but it was very easy. The walkway was paved and covered, and led us directly to the ticketing area. The hotel provided airport luggage carts for us to use!

<Content>The COOLEST place!! Just back from my second stay in 4 weeks at CitizenM...and this concept is absolutely awesome!It's just so much fun to start your trip just one night earlier and to walk to check-in the next morning.You can read from other reviews all the special settings about the room but don't forget the lobby area with it's bar and choice of snacks ...very diversified, fresh and for the location (airport) very reasonably priced :-)Believe me ... each time I have an early flight (or even just any morning flight!) and the room rate is good .... I'll stay at CitizenM.

<Content>Great aiport hotel! Decided to stay at this airport hotel because of the early flight from Schiphol airport. I could take taxi from Amsterdam but I thought why not pay a little bit more and stay at this new hotel instead of waking up very early and paying taxi. I really enjoyed the stay at this hotel. The room is small but enough space to put you luggage and other things. The bed is very comfy and it is hard to believe you are the airport location because the issolation is perfect. Nice shower, lots of tv channels, even movies are free of charge, wifi, nice shower gels...it is all there.I will definately stay at this hotel whenever I have very early flights from Schiphol. The price of the room is very tempting and if I was not a local I would stay here even though it is not in Amsterdam. With the train is very easy to reach Amsterdam

<Content>Great Hi Tech Accomodation This is a great concept in airport accomodation on a very modern style. Just about everying can be controlled from the remote control; TV, temperature, lighting, alarm call, blinds and so on. The shower and toilet are in plastic tubes but are sufficiently large enough not to feel closed in like other small bathrooms in budget hotels. Everything was immacuatly clean and spotless. Great for 1 or 2 night stays. They provide just about everything needed during your stay; hairdryer, soap/shampoo, towels, internet and PC's in the lobby......etc. A couple of minutes walk to the main airport terminal means that if you dont like the limited food offerings of the hotel, theirs plenty of other food available in the airport complex. Covered walk to the hotel and no problem using the luggage trolly to/from the airport.Great for couples.As a regular travler through Schiphol, I would highly recommend this to anyone and will be staying there again myself.

<Content>Very Cool - Comfortable I stayed for 1 night at the CitizenM. Very conveniently located within a 5 minute walk from Amsterdam Schipol Airport, this hotel is surprisingly different. It's pretty much a self serve 'automatic' hotel with automated kiosks for check in and check. There is a person at a desk to assist you. On the ground level, there is a bar with a variety of self serve food such as fresh sandwiches, salads, drinks etc. Also on the gournd level, there are six iMACs with free access and they were never all busy. There is also wireless access throughout the hotel. The rooms are different, very futuristic but built and soundproofed for comfort. One single remote controls the room from lighting, shades, TV, temperature, etc. My wake up call was to the sound of ping pong balls boucing, subtle but it works. I think you can go louder with elephant cries if you tend to sleep in. The shower and toilets are akin to a first generation transporter from Star Trek. You step into a spacious glass cylinder, once closed, the whole ceiling over your head is a shower head. I loved the place and would recommend it for business travelers and young couples.

<Content>Will fly through AMS to stay at the CitizenM Hotel We stayed at the CitizenM hotel twice in November for the beginning and end of our Thanksgiving trip. It is a FANTASTIC hotel and concept that offered comfort, relaxation, convenience, and a friendly and helpful atmosphere. The check in/out was lightning fast to allow you a speedy start to enjoy your stay and exit to catch your flight. The room has the most comfortable huge bed loaded with comfy pillows (not too flat/not too overstuffed) to enjoy a perfect night's sleep. Everything is controlled by a master control that was easy enough for a Non-techie like me to figure out on my own. I loved the mood lighting options for different colored overhead lights and background music, the cute stuffed doll sitting in the chair and the wonderful way the morning alarm wakes you up and gets you out of bed.My only (small) complaint was: I felt a little claustrophobic in the totally enclosed shower with the over head rain spout.I look forward to my next trip through Amsterdam and will ALWAYS stay at the CitizenM.

<Content>Compared to the Sheraton... We like to stay near the Schiphol terminal the night before our flight, it makes traveling so much more relaxed.So far we stayed in the Sheraton as it was the only hotel within WALKING distance. Now citizenM was built almost next to the Sheraton.Because of the much cheaper price, we tried the citizenM this time.My husband (68 years of age) doesnot want to return to citizenM next time. He dislikes the smallness of the room; the minimalist cupboard space; the tiny sink; the absence of an easy chair or table; the wall to wall bed, that needs one partner to climb over the other to leave the bed; the toilet that you can visually separate from the bed with a curtain, but that is definitely not SOUND proof; the overly complicated way (one remote) to adjust lights and temperature and tv and alarm!!! and curtains and.... with MANY not very well ducumented options.I (50) would consider comming back because of the price.Both hotels are well insulated against noise from outside the rooms. The Sheraton has a direct connection to the terminal whereas from citizenM you have to walk the pavement but this is mostly covered by a canopy.Breakfastbuffet at the Sheraton is very good indeed and the d茅cor in the breakfastroom was fascinating (although there have been transformations they say), but is expensive. Breakfast at CitizenM is expensive too, and cannot compete with the Sheraton. The dinner/snack options in the canteen are not very clear and overpriced.For (other) meals we usually use one of the very many venues in the terminal, but the cheapest and cosiest way is of course, to buy your own groceries at Albert Heijn in the terminal, and picknick in your room! You definitely will have crumbs in your BED at citizenM though!

<Content>Unique experience I stayed at Citizen M the night before my flight home to US. It was fantastic.....something you'd never find in the US....thoroughly Jetson-like with the glass pods for the shower and toilet. Great bed that consumes the entire end of the room. Everything is controlled by a keypad that you can carry with you. You can even change the mood of the room with different color lighting. Great concept...simple; no frills; great price; very clean and modern. Free internet, which is very welcome in Europe. Some places charge as much as a monthly fee in the US. Great self check-in. Great comfortable lobbies....very youthful place.Not really a great place for more than one.

<Content>Perfect for a quick stay This is a great hotel concept and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a convenient and affordable place to sleep for a night between flights. I stayed at Citizen M recently when my planned direct flight back to NJ from Rome was canceled, and I found myself with 14 hour over-night layover in Amsterdam. I was traveling with my daughter and didn't want her to have to stay up all night in the airport, so I searched for hotel options and found Citizen M. It seemed perfect for our needs (basically a place to sleep for a quick over night and a shower in the morning), and it worked out very well. One problem we did have was that there seemed to be no signs in the airport itself giving any indication where Citizen M might be, which I had been hoping for given the description on their website stating that it was connected to the airport via a covered walk way. We arrived at the airport quite late, and had a hard time finding anyone who could tell us where to go to find the hotel. This coupled with the fact that they apparently close most of the ground level doors sometime before midnight, so we had to walk up and down the length of the airport to find an open door to get out, made simply getting to the hotel somewhat annoying. (Once you do find your way outside, if you face toward the street/away from the airport, there is a sidewalk to the right with a cover over it (no side protection, so if it's windy or raining sideways you'd be in trouble) that leads to the hotel. We took the free baggage cart from the airport over to the hotel, where there were many more parked outside ready for use on the way back in the morning. This made lugging our bags over much more convenient.Once at the hotel, everything was great. Check in is easy and quick (self check in style using one of many computer terminals arrayed as you walk in the door). If you can make your way through a self-checkout aisle at the supermarket, CitizenM's check in system will be no problem. The room was very functional for a quick stay. I'm not sure I'd want to spend a longer vacation or full week of business travel here, but it worked very well for us. The decor is somewhere between 2001 A Space Odyssey and Star Trek (particularly the transporter room given the circular shower and toilet enclosures), but it is clean, bright, and makes good use of purposefully limited space. My daughter had great fun playing with the multimedia controller - changing lighting colors, changing TV display settings, opening and closing the blinds and shade, and finally setting our wake up call so that we woke up to the sound of jungle noises including elephants (there appeared to be several other options, some more standard sounding, as well). Bed was comfortable and very big (plenty of room for two people who otherwise wouldn't be sharing one). Shower was great. Toilet enclosure is weird, but works. It was great to have in-room Wi-Fi internet access again, after having survived for a week without at our other hotel in Rome.The entire downstairs of the hotel is a large lounge area with multiple sitting areas, TV's, computers (looked like about four public Apple Macintoshes, as well as several desks for lap top use), and even several large dining room/conference room sized tables where you could either sit and work or have a family meal. There is also a coffee bar and a decent selection of ready-to-eat food (breads, sandwiches, salads, yogurt, fruit, and some dinner meals, though we didn't look too carefully at these since we were only there for breakfast). This is clearly aimed at a quick, simple snack or meal after or before a day of traveling, but again, this was perfect for what we were looking for during our quick stay. To sum up - if you are looking for a place for a quick, convenient stay, where you can get a good rest, take a shower (and a pretty cool one at that), grab a good quality quick bite, and have the modern conveniences of internet, TV channel choices, etc., at a very reasonable rate, this is the place for you. Given the amount of time I spend traveling for business and vacations, and how often the airlines mess up my plans these days, I hope that many more of these CitizenM hotels spring up at other airports soon.

Discounted room in Holiday Inn from booking.com better option for business traveller into NL

<Content>Citizen M gets an A+ Citizen M is a much needed hotel concept in the world today. The Schipol location is simply a few minutes walk from the terminal. The check in process was simple and fun. The room was incredibly comfortable and included all the amenities of an expensive hotel. The room setup is groovy, to say the least. I was on a layover between Venezia and Memphis and was most impressed. I have already booked a room in December for my next layover.

<Content>Original trendy Concept A very original and trendy concept that shows as soon as you enter: efficient self check-in with staff available for assistance. The room was also nice with everything you need, very compact and nice design. Especially the quality of the bed was superb (nice thick and thorough matrass).However, a point for improvement, was the food. If you want a good rate on price/quality have dinner somewhere else. In my opinion the prices for self-service catering are way over the top.Conclusion: if you want a good night's rest in a nice and trendy setting this is the place to be.

It doesn't matter whether you are staying one night or multiple nights, you can't beat this hotel on price, convenience, cleanliness, or atmosphere.I hope there will soon be more Citizen M hotels in other places I travel.

<Content>An Oasis!! After traveling with luggage, long lines, crowds, etc was almost teary-eyed when i reached my room here. I jumped on extremely comfortable large bed with feather comforter and feather pillows and could barely get up to go get a drink in the cool bar/lobby.Rooms are small, but the space is used with high degree of efficiency. Style is a little futuristic, but still comfortable.The hotel entrance is only 100 meter covered-walkway from the airport. The lobby has some nice seating areas. The lobby bar has a nice selection of sushi, sandwiches, etc and is open 24 hours.The staff we're very helpful and friendly.

<Content>Loved it, would love to stay there again I loved my stay at the CitizenM. It's very close to the airport, and if you're coming on train, the train stops inside the airport, so it's very convenient. The train to the city center is also convenient and frequent, and not at all a barrier to an enjoyable stay.The employees at CitizenM were wonderful - always smiling, helpful, and ready to answer a question. The design in the lobby and the rooms was fantastic. The room itself is awesome - very modern and cool. The coolest thing I discovered is that the touch-screen remote (that also controls the temperature and lights) has an alarm function, which turns on all the lights when it's time for you to wake up! I don't know when I'm going to Amsterdam again, but I would be excited to stay at the CitizenM again!

<Content>Affordable, simple, cool Simply awesome. Rooms are very small, but if you know this going in it isn't going to bother you. Need some space? Head down to one of the various lounging areas in the lobby. Loads of books to browse, cool chairs to sit on and free internet. The huge bed was comfortable for myself, my husband and 1-year old. We had two suitcases, two hand bags and the baby's car seat and pushchair and it was ok in the room. Great views of planes at Schiphol. Very short walk from airport. Beautiful design. Best of all: Affordable. Try staying at the Sheraton or anywhere else for 69 Euros!Downsides: Signage from inside the airport. I had to ask someone where to go and then struggled to find signs. Also, if you want food at the hotel it is expensive. Then again, you are stuck here because food at the airport is expensive, too.

<Content>Fun place to stay Great location for overnight stay. Immaculately clean. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Fun changing mood of the room and color of lights with computer pad. Never did figure out exactly how to set it, but had fun with trial and error. It was like staying in a futuristic movie. Very compact but efficiently laid out room. Only real complaint is that no washcloths available so had to buy one at airport. Inviting lobby, awesome lighting. Nice to have Mac computers available with free internet access.

<Content>Very good night rest What a clever concept simple yet all you need. And what is in the room is top quality and design. Modern rooms with a very good bed, simple cleen design with ambient lighting. Although it's almost located on the runway and just a five minute walk from schiphol plaza, you don't hear a single noise. Also very nice staff and the electronic self check-in and out saves a lot of time. The breakfast sandwiches are very tasty. They are not included in the price and not cheep, but still cheeper than the 鈧?6 p.p. breakfast fee they charge at other hotels. We will most certainly use this hotel again when we need to stay a night at schiphol. It beets the rest.

<Content>Cheap and Chic When I made the booking I was worried about the quality of the hotel as the rates are very affordable compared to the rest of the hotels in Schiphol.I thought this would have been like a Formule 1 hotel, something when you go, you feel so depressed, that you just want to run away.Although my concern I decided to give it a try.On the contrary, although rooms are quite small, it has that extra touch that makes yuo feel at ease in a spotless environment, with friendly staff, high tech amenities and affordable rates.The colours selection as well as the quotes spread around the hotel makes also a nice friendly atmosphere. A very good combination, at least for an airport hotel where usually you spend just few hours before or after a flight.I wouldn't recommend it for longer stays, but the fact that is really within a walking distance to the airport, makes it also a valuable alternative for people who wants to commute by train to the city.

<Content>Convenient, Clean, Comfortable We connected in Amsterdam to/from other cities in Europe, and spent a night at this hotel at the beginning of our trip, and a night at the end of our trip. It is a couple minutes walk out the door of the airport to the hotel. It is new, clean, very quiet. and the beds are so very comfortable - it was excellent after our long flight. The price is inexpensive compared to in the city, or to other airport hotels. It is an easy train ride into the city's central train station - just buy a roundtrip ticket right at the airport (about 6 euro roundtrip). I will stay here again, and would certainly recommend trying this hotel! Sincerely, a Citizen M convert.

<Content>Super mod, this concept is a winner We loved this hotel. This very inexpensive, ultra modern concept will catch on like wildfire as this chain spreads across Europe. The rooms are quite small, but as everyone has said, are laid out very well. The bed is super comfy, lots of tv channels, fantastic Apple computers free in the lobby for guests, mood lighting in the rooms and inside the two tubes which house the toilet and shower, respectively. For the price you pay, this really can in no way be beat. The train ride to the city is only about 15 or 20 minutes and is no problem. The only slight nitpick would be the price of food in their canteen. If you really had a really big meal you could end up spending more than the cost of your room. Also, getting in contact with the hotel itself is very laborious. We left something in the hotel and it took a week, two phone calls and seven emails to get any sort of response. They did finally call us back however and found our item, so it all worked out in the end. The staff in the hotel are all very young and enthusiastic and the overall vibe in the hotel is very upbeat. Recommend it highly.

<Content>Inexpensive Boutique-like Hotel If you don't mind a 20 minute train ride to get into the city, this is the place to stay in Amsterdam. I booked this hotel for less than $100 USD and it is one of the best values that I have ever received from a hotel. The check-in is amazingly quick and can be done without talking to anyone, if you choose. The computer guides you through the system; however, two guest service personnel stand by for your convenience. The lobby is beautiful. The room is small (the width of the room is the length of a kingsized bed), but it is so well laid out, you would hardly notice the size. The pod toilet is private enough that you don't feel awkward about utilizing the facility with another person in the room. The TV and the room remote control is awesome. Now, the only negative about this room...the shower. Since the pod shower only works when it is closed, it is not possible to get warm water flowing before you step into the pod. This burst of cold water from the roof of the shower is quite the wake-up. The check-out from the room is just as easy as the check-in. The hotel is immediately adjacent to the airport and it is perfect for early morning departures! Also, I will seriously consider this as my base hotel for visiting Amsterdam in the future, despite the fact that it is a brief train ride from the center of town. Note, the room can only accommodate two people who are close! Meaning, don't expect your family of four to be comfortable in one room.

<Content>Excellent place to stay for an Amsterdam excursion My wife and I have stayed in this hotel twice, and it's easy to say that we'll be back again. We live in Germany, so we drive to A-dam to visit. While the parking situation could be better, that's not really the hotel's fault, since they cater to air travelers. The lobby is nicely laid out, and the computers used for check-in easy to figure out. The staff were maybe a bit too eager to help out, but I am sure they are trained to be that way. The rooms are lovely, not very big, but well laid out. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to older people or people with kids, but for single travelers or couples, it's perfect. Amsterdam is minutes away by train, and you can't beat the price of this hotel compared to staying downtown, unless you stay in a hostel.

<Content>Great rooms but v expensive canteen This is a great hotel to stay in. Easy to use and check in large and funky rooms all very well maintained and different. And given the easy access into Amsterdam worth staying in even if you are visiting the city. BUT the restaurant/canteen is very expensive indeed. Food quality good but if you want value for money bring in your own food - its even cheaper in the airport itself. That would be my only gripe. Everything else was spot on.

<Content>Nerd Heaven - but also offering the best beds in Amsterdam Perfect for a stopover for singles or close couples next to Schiphol airport. Though it is not directly connected to the terminal and you have to walk about five minutes through very recent construction adjacent to the terminal building - the hotel is worth finding your way there. The elevated bed takes about a third of the room, the round bathroom fixtures another third. Rooms have no carpet, no minibar, no coffee makers, no closets, no phones and no decent desk - but some space age mood lights and one master remote control for TV, blinds, the mood lights, and the aircon. The lobby area features mid century design furniture classics, slightly overpriced but healthy sandwiches and salads, a couple of weird self service terminals for guests - and some eager young staff helping you along. Geeky? Yes, to the max - but also very comfortable, quiet, clean, and ultimately very relaxing.

<Content>Good value, clean - too techno for its own good I stayed at the CitizenM during a trade fair. At such times it is very difficult to find a room at any kind of decent price in Amsterdam, so being able to book the CitizenM for a reasonable rate was a bonus. There was no apprehension about the cleanliness, as the hotel is brand new. Check in was on a computer at the entrance. There was a member of staff there to help with potential problems. The room was pretty small and played on its techno, wiz-bang modern theme. There is a pod for the shower and one for the toilet in the middle of the room (other peoples' photos show these). This means that there is not much privacy whilst 'visiting' either pod. Room facilities like lights, TV, blinds are controlled by a central touchpad. I guess this is fine if it works, but ours didn't, so for a time it was not possible to change channels on the TV or to switch the lights off. Mounted on the wall, the touch pad glowed brightly even when all lights were off, which - in a small room - could disturb you whilst trying to get to sleep. The staff there were very friendly and helpful. Again the hotel let itself down technically by the fact that my room key stopped functioning at the till, so everything had to be paid cash. There was no breakfast included, so everything had to be bought - that was pretty pricey. If you had time, it may be better to nip into the airport for some breakfast. All in all I thought the hotel was trying to play on its technno image too much. There's no point being ultra modern if things don't work and you have to go back to the old way of doing things anyway. It just seemed more wiz-bang than practical.I would stay there again in the same circumstances, but would probably try to find something in the centre thats a bit more classical....

The bed was great with a very good mattress and there was no obvious noise from the planes.All in all the perfect stopover hotel and much cheaper than the other nearby hotels!

<Content>A very different experience With it's modern styling and quirky techno features this hotel really stood out amongst the others we stayed at during a recent European trip. It had a HUGE and wonderfully comfortable bed, that must have been 8ft each way. but there was very little storage space except in the draw under the bed and no sitting/ desk area. except in the public lounges, We felt the rooms could have been a bit bigger, - but that bed made up for it. Excellent sound insulation meant we didn't hear any aircraft /traffic noise at all. Technophobes might dislike the remote control that controls the lights, blinds, TV etc, but I enjoyed having a play!Unusual glass cylindrical shower and toilet did cause some debate but work well as long as you are with a close friend!Parking for car drivers is at standard airport carparks close by, but as bikers we were given permission to park around the back of the hotel.- thanks! This is a bright and shiny new hotel with modern minamalist techo styling, lack of wardrobes meant it's not recommended for a long stays, but for a overnight or weekend it's a good base for seeing Amsterdam, or if you'd like to spend a lot of time in bed with someone special!

<Content>A truely conceptual hotel Definitly worth a visit. It's very slick and modern, yet relaxing and the staff are super friendly and helpful.While it is aimed more for business people, any young person will be entertained with the FREE movies, internet and 'adult movies.'The actual room may be considered a little small, but the design and layout more than makes up for that. The gagets would keep anyone busy for hours. It's got 'mood' lights in the toilet and shower. There's a great selection of music and TV channels on the flat screen. We got a room with a Runway View, which is definitly worth requesting. If you stay in Citizen M you probably won't want to leave the hotel during your stay!!!Only negatives are the lack of a proper smoking area, no tea/coffee facilities in the room and you must pay by credit card.

<Content>Did not like it very much I am surprised that I am the only one who was not impressed by this hotel. Prior to going there, I could not wait to see this trendy hotel and especially after reading all the reviews here.I got the room for 69 Euros/night which was cheap. However, I thought that there was more to this hotel than what it actually was. First of all, I did not like the idea of checking in through a computer. It felt like I was nobody. However, the staff was REALLY helpful and friendly. I went to my room, and as every guest does when they go into a room like that, I did the wow thing. However, after a few minutes I started realizing how uncomfortable the room was. The sink is tiny and is in the middle of the room. If you spill any water around, you're in trouble. The idea of the rain shower was nice. However, once you get in there, you realize that the shower knobs are extremely uncomfortable to control, especially when you have wet hands. When I wanted to get an extra towel, I tried to use the phone with no luck. I finally went downstairs and asked them how to operate the phone to have towels delivered to my room, they said that they don't have housekeeping services and that I would need to come down and get them myself !!The room itself was small and had no desk or a large table to put your stuff in. Only two tiny tables and that's it. The safe box is tiny. The MoodPad was very hard to operate and I honestly did not like it. I very much prefer to do these things manually. The Do Not Disturb sign is basically a picture of a woman covered in bed sheets saying Don't come in. Someone is naked in this room. I felt very uncomfortable with this sign. In the restaurant downstairs, they had no white sugar! The plastic cups for coffee have a cover yet no hole to drink through! I've never seen something like that before. The train ride to Amsterdam Central takes about 20 minutes. The train runs every 10 minutes I think but once every hour after midnight or so.On the other hand, the bed was very nice and comfortable with 4 pillows. The staff downstairs was also friendly and helpful. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you find a hotel with the same price in downtown Amsterdam.

<Content>citizenM is great! Great Hotel! The hotel is great, it was a three minute walk from the airport, the rooms while small are very comfortable and modern, it is great to be able to control the temperature and many free on demand movies are offered. It is easy to reach the city center from the train station at the airport so that wasnt a problem. The ony minor inconvenience I encountered was I arrived at 1230 and was told I couldnt check in until exactly 1400 but that was not a big deal. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.

The bathroom is not very private and there is only minimal space in which to get around and only a small space for hanging clothes.

<Content>Great cocktails Got the opportunity to go to Schiphol's citizenM for test-sleeping before the 'grand opening' in June. We've been to many hotels with practically any numbers of stars, but the heart almost never pumped any faster. Now it did, five minutes after arriving by train at Schiphol when receiving our first Mobile Martini cocktail. Then, an unwanted gap between the first and second was necessary, because we had to be able to criticise our stay. Ok, self-check-in; smooth and fast, dinner; (only) prepackaged food and beverages, good quality and fresh, but we like a real kitchen more, room; wow!, very small and very nice, this is the secret why the hotel offers 250 rooms in such relatively small building, it works perfect, living-rooms; each has its own typical design, some we liked, some not, great were the hundreds of (fashion, design and reading) books that completed the living-rooms, bar; friendly staff, worked their pants off because of the triangle 'test-sleeping-for free-Dutch'...The price? Well, if you book early, 35 euro's per person (room occupied by two) is almost a 12-bed-hostel-room price these days. Food and beverages are not especially cheap, but if it is too much for you, walk 2 minutes, take the train to the centre of Amsterdam for 7 minutes, take a tram for 10 minutes a little off the centre and you can eat a little more per euro.Enough said, good luck at citizenM and enjoy Amsterdam

<Content>Really cool! This hotel is great when you travel with a group of friends, because they have super relaxed living rooms in the lobby where you can enjoy your drinks and food in a trendy design setting.Compared to CitizenM most hotels are rather oldfashioned and dull...

<Content>Phantastic Concept and Value I had the privilege of being the first real guest of the hotel when I walked in because of its proximity to the airport while they were still in their test phase. The hotel is very inexpensive as Amsterdam airport hotels go, and yet it is an easy 100m covered walk to the terminal while many other hotels have only bus service. The concept is fantastic: very quiet, a very comfortable and luxurious bed, very nice shower and appliances, ridiculously low international phone charges, free Wifi and movies. What makes the price possible is the clever utilization of the most modern appliances and tricks to fit everything that needs to be there in a very compact space, resulting in a small but fully functional and even luxurious room of a rather futuristic but cheerful and pleasing design. The hotel also has a small restaurant / canteen focusing on sushi, wraps and other healthy fare that gets you a good meal quickly. In my opinion a real winner.

<Content>CitizenM will amaze you! CitizenM offers you the most relaxed stay ever. It's almost a waste to take the train and go to Amsterdam. You'd rather stay in the hotel to enjoy a Vesper Martini, some sushi and watch a movie.CitizenM thought of everything. AM / PM showergel, cosi mood lights, kingsize beds, rainshowers, need I go on...

<Content>Incredible!!!!! As I have stayed in many airport-hotels and had the opportunity to take a look at this hotel before it officially opens, I was 200% impressed.The entrance is magnificent, you check in with a computer and than you are able to go to your room. The lobby is full of design furniture which really fits the style and an awesome bar where you can buy coffee's and cocktails. I have just tried an cappucino and it is not one of these machine-regulated-powder-coffee but a good coffee made by an educated barista. Also at the bar you can buy healthy food like sushi, salads and wraps. Besides that there are cool gadgets like foot cream, eye masks etc. Personally I like a room to be bright since it is usually no that much fun to stay in a hotelroom by yourself. I have not slept in the room but only took a look at it, just to be clear. The rooms are small but everything is equipped with more than you need. The bed is soft, big and clean with good pillows and nice mattrass. Than you have a cool remote control with lcd screen which gives you the opportunity to set moodlights in your room and to open and close the curtains (love it!). The power-shower looks extremely comfortable and the AM and PM shampoo is something, which shows again that everything has been perfectly thought about in detail.I absolutely recommend this hotel in the Schiphol area since the Sheraton and Hilton across from this hotel are absolutely not worth their money compared with this hotel. The Hilton their standard rooms are as big as the CitizenM rooms and the Sheraton has outdated rooms with outdated service.viva la CitizenM!
