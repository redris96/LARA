<Content>Nikko - Great Location  This hotel has a lot going for it. The location is outstanding. It's located in the Polanco neighborhood which is full of high end auto dealers, large Spanish homes, upscale shopping and many restaurants. It's near the W hotel as well as the JW Marriott. Honestly, if I were staying on my own I'd probably pick one of the these hotels just because they seemed a bit more modern. The Nikko is huge and there are several restaurants and bars within the hotel. There is even an English Pub that serves sushi and tacos. (It's an English Pub in a Japanese hotel in Mexico City - It's very international! ) The hotel is very clean and my room, which was a standard king, was spacious and well appointed and spotless. It was not brand new or incredibly modern, but it had been remodeled in the last 3-5 years. (I believe the deluxe rooms have been remodeled this year). Overall the hotel's public spaces have an 80's or 90's vibe to them. Nothing is worn out or old, it's just a bit dated. The staff was helpful when needed and the breakfast buffet was excellent. I was staying as a solo woman traveling with a business group and felt 100% safe the entire week. I did not use the indoor pool or exercise facilities, but stopped in for a peek and they seemed very nice. There are also several shops within the hotel and an American Express office as well. I would stay at the Nikko again and I would be comfortable recommending it to friends. However if the price is the same I'd rather stay at more modern hotel like the W. But if the price were less, I'd stay at the Nikko again and be perfectly happy.

<Content>Ok Stay, not as it used to be My recent visit to the Nikko was late November 2007.When we go to Mexico City most of the times we stay at The Nikko. Many famous people stay here. First day we had the opportunity to see the President of Mexico going to a meeting. (On a visit in the 90鈥檚 I was riding the elevator with Ms. Margaret Thatcher.) Another day we met Ms. Guevara who has won many medals for Mexico. Also we saw singers and bands.There are many restaurants and shops around the area, good transportation from private limo to subway station Auditorio. Since I mention Limo I should recommend two limo drivers one is Jose Arturo Soria Lopez who works for the hotel. He is a very nice man who provides good service. The other driver was Jose Silva Vallejo, he was assigned to us by a third party. Mr. Silva is at the Sheraton Maria Isabel on Reforma Ave. He was always on time. He also speaks English and helped my husband with some translations. We always felt safe and in good hands. The hotel is in Polanco neighborhood. The location is very good. The Nikko is close to Chapultepec. Ask for a room with a view. A fiew blocks away you can find the Auditorio Nacional and several museums. If you want to do the 鈥淭urisbu鈥? the stop is very close by the hotel. Polanco has many shops and restaurants but if you want to eat in the hotel they have at least 4 restaurants. Food at Teppan Grill restaurant is good, however if you are allergic to something be extremely cautious. After I told the waiter I was allergic to shrimps, he did not pay attention and serve dumplings with shrimps instead of the beef I ordered. It was a good thing they were bite size with little pices of shrimp; and I realized it was shrimp after the first dumpling. So I only got swollen half of the face. You may think they apologized for that, think again. El Jardin restaurant is not as good as it used to be, but it is ok. We had good meals at O鈥檓ei restaurant. Some night we went to listen live music they had at the lobby bar. There are some rooms that have been remodel and those cost more. The staff was always very friendly and nice but I notice some changes. We order many times room service and some times took a lot of time for them to deliver. It was the same story to have them to take the food cart out of the room. It took them the whole morning and part of the afternoon to do so. We also used the laundry services; they deliver the cloths very late at night. The employee apologized and told me they were only 3 persons for the whole hotel to do the laundry job. Make me think the hotel cut off on employees. That explains why they were later than normal to deliver services.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Service I stayed for two nights and loved this hotel. On the advice of a business partner, I booked on the Executive Floor. The rooms there are newly done in an Asian-fusion modern look. If you are a woman traveling on business, this is THE place to stay. They take great care of you, arrange for your taxis (a bit more expensive, but completely safe), and make sure all of your needs are met. Almost everyone in the hotel is bilingual. It is pricier than the rest, but worth the money if you can swing it. They also have a great health club (which I didn't use, but wish I did!). p.s. Smoking is now banned in public places in Mexico, so there were no issues

<Content>I Remember Why I Love the Nikko During my stay 4/14-4/18, I reminded myself why I love this hotel. The details the management have thought out is amazing.For instance, each morning my wake up call was a real person who greeted me by name, informed me of the days weather forecast, and asked if they could do anything else. I had not stayed at the Nikko for about 10 months. However, the staff were the same. From the bell hop and up, the turnover seems small. Therefore, the staff are very dedicated to the company and have a high level of training.I head back for another week in 5 days. Although away for business, the Nikko is a great home away from home after long hours at the office.

<Content>Still a Great Hotel in a Great City I've stayed at the Nikko in Mexico City many times in the past, but this was the first time in about six years, and this time it was for a weekend with my husband. It was as ever the perfect location both for meeting up with friends living in town and for restaurants and major museums. The pool was especially nice after a long walk through the newly renovated Centro Historico. Air conditioning was a bit slow but improved after we had been in the room longer. The breakfast is one of the best, and there is nothing as good as a Mexican breakfast buffet. The staff was very helpful and did a great job packing up a painting for us to take on the plane. Make sure you ask for the view out over the park, which is magnificent. Mexico City looked better than ever -- on Sundays, Avenue Reforma is now closed to cars and we watched hundreds of Mexican families riding around having fun. Check the New York Times Mexico travel page -- we got some good suggestions for new things to do there.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Hotel Nikko I stayed six nights at the Hotel Nikko on business earlier this month, and had read through all the TripAdvisor reviews before doing so to try to get an idea of what to expect. I found TripAdvisor helpful, and the Hotel Nikko's high ratings to be very well-deserved.The hotel is lovely - great location in the Polanco area which was safe and convenient for walking to nearby restaurants and sights (like the Museum of Anthropology, which was exceptional), as well as to my meetings which were nearby. I stayed in a superior room on the 30th floor, and found the room to be everything that I had expected and more - very comfortable bed, great amenities, wonderful bathroom with a shower that I wished I could have taken home with me, flat-screen tv, and a beautiful view of the park and city from my window. I honestly couldn't find a single thing to complain about if I had tried. Common areas in the hotel were clean and well-maintained, and the health club and pool areas were very well-equipped. I also have to say that the staff were some of the friendliest I have encountered at any hotel. Everyone had a ready smile and greeting and bent over backwards to be of service.The little pastry and coffee shop in the lobby was great for picking up a quick bite in the morning, and the breakfast buffet in the El Jardin restaurant was reasonably priced and delicious, with a mix of basic buffet dishes and some very good Mexican breakfast items. I would not hesitate to stay here again and would recommend the hotel to anyone considering a stay in Mexico City.

<Content>Nice hotel in a great location We had a room on the 26th floor overlooking the park, which gave us an awesome view of the city below. The hotel itself is very nice, while at the same time not totally memorable. Tasteful, I guess you could say. The common areas were indeed smoky, though I think that's just how it is in Mexico City in general. The concierge was very helpful in helping us arrange transportation to different restaurants and museums.The one thing that was lacking was tour options for the non-business traveler. I understand the hotel caters to business travelers mainly, but those of us passing through on vacation could use a little attention. We were very surprised we couldn't book a tour of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera art, since those artists figure so prominently in Mexico City tourism. Our only option was to hire a private driver for $35 USD an hour to take us around. That wasn't going to work.

<Content>Smokers delight I joined my husband on a business trip to see some of the sights of this fast growing beautiful city.It is listed as a 5 star hotel, it is, but it's dated and the property and hotel are showing it's age and neglect.Check -in was prompt and professional. Our room was well appointed and quiet. Not too much hallway or elevator noise.My major complaint is that smoking is allowed everywhere throughout the hotel. If you are a smoker, you hit the jackpot! If you have breathing problems, beware.There are no non-smoking areas to relax and enjoy the hotel outside of your hotel room. Staff members I asked about non-smoking areas seemed surprised that I would ask the question. It was suggested that I go to my room or better yet go outside to the nearest starbucks. Out of desperation and struggling to breathe I took refuge in the fitness center.My other complaint is the housekeepers took a very long time cleaning the rooms. There is one person to clean the room, one to replenish the towels, one to restock the mini-bar, another to restock the coffee bar and another person to check that all was done properly.

<Content>Great Business trip hotel I stay at the Nikko each time I travel to Mexico City. There a few reasons for this. Mainly it's in a nice, relatively safe neighborhood in the city (Polanco) and it's close to many of our business partners. Another reason is that they have an amazing business center, probably the best I've ever experienced. The staff is very helpful and professional.The hotel itself is a mixture of great and average. The lobby, the workout center, the restaurants, are all great. The rooms we usually stay are just average but not necessarily bad. The beds are a little on the hard side and the room furnishings themselves look to be a little outdated. But again, it's still a nice and clean environment. The bathrooms are nice and offers Neutrogena amenities. I'm sure that if you pay a little more than just the standard rates, you could get amazing rooms on the NIkko Executive floors (which seem to be from floor 31 and up). All and all a solid choice hotel. It won't be the absolute BEST you've stayed in but it's above average for sure.

<Content>Get your wallet out... My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights whilst on vacation during June 2007. Please find my feedback / comments below:BookingWe booked on hotelclub and got very reasonable rates (+- USD 130 pn without breakfast) that had left us quite excited. Confirmation process was smooth.Check-inWe arrived late at night after a flight delay. Staff on hand were friendly and polite and processed our check-in pretty quickly.RoomThe bedroom was comfortable - the size you'd expect for this type of hotel, although the bathroom could be a little bigger. The bed was comfortable and the air-conditioning worked fine. The fridge was very small, not allowing us much space to store things we had purchased. Our room was serviced in the late afternoon which annoyed us as we'd make early starts and want an afternoon nap prior to heading out for the evening.ConciergeThis was a huge let down for us and has significantly pulled down this rating. We requested concierge to book a tour for us (three weeks prior to our arrival) for the first day we were there and get some museum / entrance tickets for the second day. We had confirmation emails indicating both would be done.The first day tour was not booked at midnight when we arrived. They managed to scramble to get us sorted out by the morning, but we were not impressed as it had been confirmed 3 weeks prior. They managed to obtain one set of tickets (not both) after telling us there would be no problem (this was halfway through day 1). The worst bit is the service fees - we were charged a fee (which wasn't indicated to us) for a service they could not even provide. This did not excite us. Pay pay pay.MealsWe only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was reasonably priced by world standards, although once again, there was some confusion caused by our meal voucher. You'd think they'd handle this seemlessly in a hotel claiming to be 5-star. We didn't bother with other meals at the hotel after the concierge experiences and found very good restaurants located close by. We are big fans of fresh fruit and found the fruit presented to be quite tasteless.Business CentreUpon check-in, I was informed that I would be able to use the business centre at my leisure - there was no mention of cost. I was horrified, after using the Internet for approx an hour, to have a 200 peso charge awaiting me. The facilities are of a decent standard, but incredibly expensive.LocationThis is probably the best thing the hotel has going for it. The hotel is located in Polanco which is walking distance from Chapultepec Park (including the Museum of Anthropology, the zoo and the Castle) as well as many good restaurants. A taxi from the hotel to the airport is 260 pesos (why didn't concierge tell us this on the way in where we paid more with a booked transfer)?Touring - not a reflection on the hotel, but worth a mentionWe had booked tours (in addition to what concierge was supposed to book) that used Grayline as a local operator. Stay away! The airport transfer was overpriced and the tour didn't cover all the places it was supposed to (instead we got dumped at a souvenir trap for an hour so the guide could maximise his kickbacks). We were also told English would be the primary language for our tour, but we wound up being the only English speaking participants and suffered for that.Other facilitiesWe didn't use other facilities of the hotel.OverallThe hotel is clean and comfortable, but their add-on costs and efficiency of concierge are a big big turnoff. I would not recommend it and would not stay there again.

<Content>Amazing Place Mexico City: Hotel Nikko:Beautiful PlaceI was afraid that being a business hotel we would be overlooked while on our vacation, was I wrong. The concierge service was the best i've experienced. They helped set up all our tours, and even set up our bus ride to our next city we were visiting. The rooms were nicely decorated and the beds were extremely comfortable. There are over five restaurants in the hotel and if you get tired of those the hotel Presidente is next door with more.I would choose this hotel again.

<Content>Loved it I loved the Nikko. The service was incredible. It was a business trip, but I tacked an a couple of personal days onto the trip. It's a little pricey, and I normally would stay at a less expensive hotel for personal travel. However, I think the Nikko was worth it. I stayed on the executive floor, and found the room to be very comfortable. I read a couple of reviews about a hard bed, but I didn't have any trouble. With the executive floor you get free breakfast (quite good with cold and hot food) and free happy hour drinks/appetizers. The Nikko is the business district, Polanco, so it's a little farther away from the zocolo and the historic downtown area. But the touribus stops close to the hotel, and it takes you all around town (for about $10USD I think) and you can get on/off as much as you'd like. Prior to my trip, I emailed the concierge to arrange a tour of Teotihaucan/ Church of Our Lady Guadalupe. The tour was great, and it was very easy to arrange.

<Content>Great for the business traveler! I was in Mexico City on business for the week of January 7 - 12, 2007 and everyday was great. Was upgraded to the Executive Floors and in a nutshell the only difference is your breakfast and drinks are included. There is some renovations being done currently on some Executive floors, but you don鈥檛 hear them at night. OVERALLOverall the hotel staff is excellent, always trying to lend a hand or offering to gather your bags. I did not see many tourists at this hotel, as I got the impression that it caters to the business traveler. Loved the idea that you can access wireless internet from anywhere in the hotel. This is great if you don't want to spend your evening in your room working.FOODThe breakfast buffet was my favorite since you can't go wrong with fruits and scrambled eggs. For dinner the Japanese restaurant on the second floor is the best. The service is great and the food is really good as well. There is a another Sushi type of restaurant on the main floor near the shops and I would not recommend it. The service was horrible and the waitress did not understand English. We got up and left after we asked for bottled water and couldn't understand what we wanted. GYMThe gym and pool area are modern and the hotel has the latest cardio equipment. Word of advice, bring your own headphones if you want to watch TV as you do your cardio as people sweat and their sweat is left of the headsets....pretty disgusting.Aside from that if I have to return to Mexico City, I would definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>MexicoCity Nikko I just returned from a long weekend in Mexico City that was truly wonderful thanks much in part to the Hotel Nikko. It was our 18th wedding anniversary and the Nikko made the wkend special. The room was very nice and extremely clean with comfortable beds. Service was exceptional and the concierge very helpful. Even room service arrived quickly and the food was delicious and still warm. For the price I think the Nikko is a great value for this area. With a Starbucks and a great many restaurants in the area, the Nikko is in the center of it all. Close to Chapultapec park and the TourBus route, you could not ask for a better place to stay with no hidden charges unlike the Intercontinental.

<Content>Nice Hotel-Slightly Disjointed Staff The hotel was very nice and in an excellent part of town. Some of the staff was very accomodating and some of the staff, although friendly, did not seem to understand simple or minor requests. This was not a result of a language barrier (everyone spoke English very well) but rather, they seemed thrown off by the requests. These are however minor issues and I would recommend the hotel again. By the way, the shower water pressure was very high, which I like very much.

<Content>Nikko Mexico was great Traveled for business with 3 other colleagues. I called directly and got a better rate than advertised since we booked 4 rooms for a week. The rooms had a safe, robe, slippers, tv (several English language stations), alarm clock. Bathroom was nice and bed was comfortable. Everything was clean. Had a nice view of the Chapultepec Park. Staff was very attentive, pleasant and efficient and everything we needed was taken care of. They have a few in house restaurants including Mexican, sushi, Japanese and general. There is also a pastry / coffee / chocolate place on the lobby level if you are not into big breakfasts. Big breakfast buffet but it was not included in the price. SInce I don't eat animal products including dairy (I'm a vegan) I did not partake but my fellow travelers liked it. There is a really nice restaurant about 3 blocks away called SAKS that had mixed food including several vegetarian offerings. All of us raved about the food and service there and was reasonably priced. Fitness area is good and they have an indoor pool. There are some nice shops with jewelry and art too - I bought a nice turquoise and silver set for reasonable price considering it was in a hotel. They have several tours available that can be charged to your room - to the Teotihuacan Pyramids, Taxco, Mexican Folk Ballet etc. I've been to all of them at one time or another and they are all enjoyable and reasonably priced - They pick you up / drop you off at the hotel - Pyramids group tour is about $55 USD. The open tour bus of Mexico City has a stop just across from the hotel as well.

<Content>Excellent Stay on the Exec Floor We stayed three nights here at the end of July, in two exec rooms. These were large rooms, well decorated in a fairly modern, neutral style, with fabulous views across the city as they are on high floors. The bathroom had a steam-free mirror and good towels and toiletries.The main concierge desk was generally very good. I emailed them before we left about airport transfers and tours: each enquiry was answered immediately with a detailed response, and both the airport car and the tour guide were reasonably priced (for a place like this) and showed up as arranged. The only slight problem was one evening (admittedly quite late) we had great difficulty getting anyone to telephone our airline for information on a change in the time of our flight. The executive floor was well worth the extra room cost. The 'lounge' where breakfast and drinks are served is a fairly uninspiring room but it has an excellent view; the breakfast is a good varied buffet and free drinks and snacks are served throughout the evening by really excellent, attentive staff. The wake up service is particularly good too - just as a previous reviewer said, a wake up call is followed a few seconds later by drinks of your choice brought to the door. Having seen the lobby area and main bar I was very glad to have the executive lounge, as the main public area looked rather noisy and tacky.The location - Polanco - was a pleasant suburb but not particularly convenient for sightseeing, we felt. The park and museums are nearby but it's a fair distance to other sightseeing areas; there is a lack of safe, affordable taxis and the traffic in the city was terrible (we were there during demonstrations that closed the main route through the city, so it was worse than usual I think). We therefore used the metro to get around but this was quite time-consuming - the stops are some distance apart so you often have to walk some way to your destination.Overall this is an excellent hotel and the executive floors are worth the price; if the places you want to see are in this district this would be an excellent choice.

<Content>won't return-noisy and antiquated Building and lobby right out of the 60's . The first impression is two different sets of piped music going at the same time upon entering lobby. My husband and I stayed there 12 days. They had construction going on on the floor above us., even on Sunday. We stayed on the executive level for more comfort. These rooms are 250.00 a night and that's ok, but we were nickeled and dimed to death. Hotel would not let us use our Nikko points for the last 2 nights , even though our total hotel expenditures were over 10,000.00 (ten thousand) dollars. We entertained at the hotel and had another room for a colleague for 3 nights. That's just bad business. We will go to the newly remodeled Marriott from now on.

<Content>NIce hotel, but really nothing fabulous Stayed at this hotel on business first weekend in May. Paid extra to upgrade to exec floor(About $30), which was worth it for access to bfast, snacks, bottled water and drinks. Hotel Bar huge with OK drinks and music (at least on Saturday). Good Band.NIce room, AC works, bed OK, room clean with great view (38th floor). Bad noise insulation between rooms. NIce toiletries. Nice wakeup service with coffee. In house cafe awful. Do not eat there. Concierge service mediocre, recommedations basically guidebook nonsense. They could care less. Much better concierge service at Sher. Maria Isabel. We had other (local) advice for places to eat which worked out. If in Polanco, go to Garabatos (casual and fun), Cafe de Lutece (little french type place for lunch and drinks, Taco Inn and Casa al pastor for al pastor and Victoria Beer (pork sliced off rotisserie, Yum), Argentinian Ice Cream Place across street from Taco Inn (fabulous) Location of hotel is terrific, close to entrance to park and auditorium. (Be careful crossing the street).Shopping in Polanco very expensive with exclusive shops, items more expensive than in US. Internet access at hotel $15 a day, but it works. Taxi access much worse that Maria Isabel. Overpriced cars at door, no really close Siito Taxi stand. Last time stayed at the Sheraton Maria Isabel near embassy and zona rosa. Again, each location's benefit depends on what you want to do, and where you wish to go.

<Content>Very good hotel, gymnasium has very loud piped music The Nikko is probably the best hotel I've stayed in whilst in Mexico and I've stayed at the Intercontinental and the Crowne Plaza. I stayed there for two weeks.The staff seem to be better trained than at the other hotels.My room was small but well laid out. The internet was $15/day. First they put me in room 1201 which was very noisy from the lifts next to my room which sounded like an aircraft taking off and then the airconditioning from the hotel next door was outside my window. After asking to be moved they put me in room 3420 which was a much quieter room but there is a lot of traffic outside so you still hear car alarms etc but much better than being next to the elevator.Also, each morning I was woken up by the shower in the room next to me. They use these Oxigenic showheads to save water but they are noisy.The other place that was noisy is in the Gym which has very loud pop music, so loud I had to leave - fortunately the swimming pool was quieter. The last gripe about noise is the lobby bar where I went one night for a drink but the music was very loud.I used room service whilst I was there an it was very good. The beds have a thick downer mattress protector which seems ok at first but after two nights my back was killing me. I took off the mattress protector and the mattress underneath was hard but at least my back recovered.

<Content>Absolutely Spectacular! No question that this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. BUT, there is a caveat. YOU MUST STAY IN THE NEWLY REMODELED ROOMS!!! These are on the 39th floor which means they are Executive Level rooms. It is worth the extra money (probably about $40USD per night). The Executive Level means you have access to the Exec. Check in on the 40th floor along with the Executive lounge which serves free breakfast and night cocktails. The rooms on the 39th are BRAND new so much so that the one I was in actually smelled new (you know that construction smell!). The room decor on these new rooms is very akin to the W Hotels (I shouldn't say this too loud since the W is just down the street from the Nikko). The view is phenomenal and the service is 5****. They go above and beyond the call to make things right. On the executive floor you also have access to a butler service that will press your clothes and shine your shoes. In the morning, my wake up call was followed by fresh coffee moments later -- with warm milk for the coffee! The hotel has a gym and spa area on the 4th floor. For hotel gyms it actually has a lot of equipment. I am a gym freak so I found a Gold's Gym within walking distance (15 minutes). There are a bunch of hotels right in this area (the InterContinental, W Hotel, Marriott, etc)... so location wise there isn't much difference. The W looked to be quite happening at night as the lobby bar was PACKED. BUT, if you want a nice luxury hotel, the Nikko is the place to be. Again, I take no responsibility if you do not stay in the renovated rooms.As far as the neighbourhood, Polanco is one of the safest and wealthiest neighbourhoods in Mexico City. No problem walking around during the day or night. There are plenty of police around too. Shopping in this area is for the wealthy too. With Hugo Boss, Armani, Canali, etc. the shops are exclusive designer shops. There is also a tour bus that stops near this hotel and it will take you around the city in about 3 hours if you don't get off the bus.
