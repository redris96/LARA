<Content>The smallest shower on earth! In spite of the negative connotations of the title, we had a good experience of this hotel. The man at reception was extremely welcoming and our room very spacious. there was some misunderstanding as the website had said private bath and shower but this in italy means 'bathroom' rather than bath. We had a nice balcony and great air conditioning. The shower was literally too small to even move in, anyway who is remotely what you may describe as 'overweight' may have difficulties. for us, we were there only 1 night so it did not deter from us having an enjoyable stay!

<Content>Very nice hotel close to the station and the Centre of Florence The hotel is very easy to find, less than 5 minutes walk from the station Santa Marie Novella (Central Station). When I stepped in the Hotel I was welcomed by a French-speaking man who already knew who I was. The room had a fridge, air conditionning and a big ceiling fan. The bathroom was OK, with a shower and everything clean.The internet access provided is a little expensive but very handy. The leather market is 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and the Cathedral about 10 minutes, so everything is perfect. The staff was willing to help me with advices on the town, and provided me a map. The breakfast was ok, with a rather small choice of stuff to eat and any kind of good coffee.

<Content>Excellent Staff - Nice Hotel My colleagues and I were very happy with this hotel. They were helpful from the moment we arrived with our luggage several hours before checkin (they had one room ready, so we stored everything there).The staff were exceptionally nice and friendly. We had a an early morning flight, and Georgio, the man who works nights, made us coffees at 5:00AM, apologizing that the breakfast pastries simply hadn't been delivered yet. Many places in Firenze are fine, but not known for friendly staff.The location is great - it's off on a side street, so quieter than many places (Firenze is a loud city that doesn't sleep much), and the staff were also helpful in making recommendations about things like restaurants that fit into a budget. The rooms are comfortable - nothing exciting, but comfortable and clean; same with the bathrooms. Decent water pressure and plenty of hot water (not as hot or high-pressure as home, but this is Italy, not the US).Still, if I were to return, I'd stay here. The prices are very reasonable (there are cheaper, but not for the location and the quality). Still, it was the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff that makes this place stand out in a crowd.

<Content>Great central location The Lombardi is in a good location and it was a great value. Our room was relatively spacious and well-lit during the day because of a big window. However, at night, it was a little dim as there was only one light on the high ceiling. The staff was very friendly and everything was clean. The only drawback, which is typical of Italian hotels, was the air conditioning. Once you figured out the remote (on which the pictures on the buttons don't really make any sense), you can get the room to a decent temperature, but there is a complex timer on the remote as well, so sometimes the AC went out in the middle of the night and you woke up hot. Furthermore, if you tried to cool your room while you were gone, the staff would go in and turn off the AC so it was always hot when you got back.

<Content>Lombardi - convenient and quiet The Lombardi was a comfortable and convenient. We were there for several nights with friends. The lobby was very small and there was no place for the five of us to sit and visit. The rooms were basic and cleaned daily. Beds were hard and we needed more pillows, but linens were fresh and clean. Rooms were quiet for being in such a busy area of town, and we had a lovely little balcony that overlooked the courtyard of the hotel next door. The bathroom was tiny and the shower was not built for middle-aged, well fed Americans. Staff was nice but could not suggest restaurants or give us directions. Internet was outrageous but there is an internet cafe not far away. Breakfast was good and the sunny breakfast room was pleasant, and the freshly brewed espresso was plentiful.

<Content>great accomodations We stopped in and booked our room. The rooms are clean, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The location in Florence is great. Parking wasnt cheap, maybe 24 Euros a day? There is no elevator and the internet can be a little sporadic (they offer free wireless in the dining area) and there is a computer that you can use as well. But the cleanliness and friendliness cant be beat. And the hotel was a great value. I stayed with my 15 month old daughter, we had the room on the very top floor so that any noise she made wasnt heard........it was a long walk up but it was practical given the time zone difference, and her odd hours.

<Content>Great budget hotel Stayed here for two nights as part of Italian honeymoon. Our criteria for selecting hotels was something cheap, clean and close to attractions. And it was perfect for that.Rooms and hotel are becoming a bit tired looking. It's not by any means a luxury hotel. But the place is clean, there's air condtioning in rooms, beds and linen are comfortable, bathroom have shower with cubicle doors, and breakfast is simple but appetising.Didn't really have much to do with staff. They were all very pleasant when we did need anything. Pictures on walls were of paintings found in the Uffizi, a nice touch.There was noise outside our room window one night, locals in the courtyard in an adjoining building, but the other night was fine. It was probably a one off.Sights are all only a short walk from the hotel. Including a local market. ((Dining recommendation is the chinese on the corner of via Fiume and cafe jolly on piazza santa maria novella.))

<Content>Awesome Find! This place was amazing! Only 50 Euro a night for a double room with bath (albeit the shower was TINY), buffet-style breakfast with hot beverages of your choice (cappuccino, cafe americano), TV, hairdryer in bathroom, couchette, plenty of space to move around. The staff was very friendly but mostly non-English speaking. We got a great map of Florence from them that was very helpful. The rooms are themed with an artist and we saw most of the art in our room in the Uffizi! Also very close to the train station and within walking distance to anything you'd want to see.

<Content>A disappointment in view of the reviews I chose this hotel mostly because of the very favourable reviews here. From that point a view, it was a disappointment.The basic price was 60 euros per night for a double room; I paid an extra 5 euros per night for a superior room. There was nothing special about the room, except that it faced the courtyard rather than the street. Another guest complained about the noise from the street (one block away from the station, and often used by buses (coaches)), so perhaps the extra 5 euros were worth it.My room was in a short corridor, about 2 metres from the reception desk. People often talked while walking in the corridor, or when going to the breakfast room. The room was quite noisy because of this.I fiddled with the air conditioning control for some time before finding out that I couldn't operate it; I had to ask the staff to turn it on and off.I agree with the review dated 13 April 2004 that the shower cubicles were small. On the other hand, I had no problem about the hot water, [-----------]Breakfast was coffee or tea, orange juice, bread and pastries, yogurt, cereals, processed cheese and spreads.The hotel's web site says that the rooms have a modem connection, but my room didn't. There's a computer in the reception area you can use for a fee. I was happy to see that it used Linux rather than Windows. The electrical plugs were of a type I hadn't seen before; the hotel provided an adapter when I asked about this.The photos on the hotel's web site are fair enough, except for photo 8, showing a room with some kind of couch, which my room certainly didn't have.Overall, it was an acceptable hotel at a fair price for Florence, but not exceptional.

<Content>Good position / friendly staff turned up in florence at about 10pm on a tuesday night. i needed to be in milan for a flight home the following morning but had been delayed and there were no further trains. stumbled out of the railway station in florence tired and needing a room for the night as i would be leaving on the 6am train the following morning. now, it was the middle of high season in august and i was expecting problems in getting a room, (especially at 10pm), bit i was in luck with this hotel. i walked out of the station, avoided the trashy looking hotels immediately outside, and by accident, found this place. the gentleman on duty was very friendly and welcoming. yes, there was a room available as there had been a cancellation, and as i was only staying from 10pm-530am he would knock 10 euros off the normal price. such a change from some of the attitudes you can get in other hotels in continental europe if you dare to turn up unannounced at an odd time or whatever. the room was quiet -(away from the road), had air-con/fan, was tastefully decorated and a good size, clean, had a TV and was of a good quality. i couldn't have been happier as i got a good night's sleep, for a good price, in decent surroundings.when i left at 530 the following morning the same guy was still there at reception to wish me a good onward trip!i've given this hotel 5 stars as it was excellent for me in the brief time i was there. i would be happy to stay there again.

<Content>Good Location: A bit shabby. We had stayed here about 10 years ago, but it is no longer a family run establishment. The furniture is getting shabby (a bed post fell off, the futon in the room was threadbare in spots). It is very close to the bus station, so don't get a room facing the street. It is noisy at 6 am with the windows closed. Nice staff, helpful, OK if you are on a budget.

<Content>Convenient choice This hotel was recommended to me by the hotel booking service at Santa Maria Novella Railway Station. It is very convenient for the station and airport bus and also for the main monuments. The building is an attractive palazzo containing several hotels, the Lombardi is on the first floor. My room was average in size, clean and had a powerful shower. Furnishings were modest but adequate. Public areas are attractive including the breakfast room and the staff were friendly and efficient. The only criticism is the potential for disturbed sleep from noise. Although the building is on a side street, coaches run along it throughout the night and the noise carries around to rooms at the side of the building. Also the reception area is just along the corridor from the guest rooms so guests returning late at night can easily be heard. Overall this hotel offers a convenient location at a reasonable price, but is less suitable for stays of a couple of days or more.

<Content>Good deal for the price This hotel is right near the train station so if you are traveling by Eurail (like we were), it is very convenient! We were only a 10 minute walk from the Duomo with some pretty good restaurants around. The hotel offers breakfast with the room rate and you should DEFINITELY take advantage of that. Between 7:30AM and 11AM, they lay out cereal, pastries (with chocolate and fruit inside), yoghurt, OJ, water and espresso, of course. If you stay out late, they have a guy at the front desk waiting up for you. We got home around 1AM one night and the guy at the front desk looked like he was sleeping, waiting up for us. They didn't complain about it though so no big deal... I would recommend this place... great deal for the price!!

<Content>The Lombardi is a perfect, small hotel .... I stayed at the Lombardi Hotel twice, in 2001 and 2002, and I can honestly say it is an excellent 2 star budget hotel. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. The hotel is virtually just around the corner from Santa Maria Novella Railway Station and across the road from the local bus/coach stops (i.e. SITA, CAP and CAF). It is about 5 mins. walk from the Duomo and 10 mins or thereabouts from the Ponte Vecchio. Restaurants and shops are in abundance - and, there's a huge daily market - all a few minutes walk away. The only fault I found with the hotel was the size of the shower cubicles. I thought they were a bit on the small side. Otherwise, I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5. It really is in an excellent hotel and it's in a great location.

<Content>Great value for the money We only stayed one night at the Lombardi, but it was very pleasant. It is close to the train station. The room was good-sized. The person working at the front desk was very helpful and called a taxi for us. He was still at work when we left very early in the morning and offered us a delightful breakfast. He was very friendly. This is a great hotel for the money.

<Content>A very good hotel for the budget-minded traveler We just returned from a two week tour of Italy, and while in Florence for a couple days we stayed at the Hotel Lombardi. For the price range (100 Euros per night, double occupancy), I'd say it rates above average. The hotel is very convenient to the train station, just a couple short blocks away. This fact made me nervous at first, because in the U.S. the neighborhoods surrounding the train and bus stations are usually pretty seedy, but here in Florence, the neighborhood and the street were perfectly fine. The Lombardi occupies one floor of a sturdy old Florentine palazzo, and I was surprised to see on the entry sign by the front door that other hotels occupy other floors, even though it's all the same building. There are only about a half dozen rooms on the Lombardi's floor, each named for a different renaissance artist from the city's history, and then there's one large room in the corner reserved for the dining room and a small bar. Our room was cozy, which is a polite way of saying small, but it was more than adequate for our needs (simply sleeping and taking a morning shower), and the ceilings are so high that it actually felt like a much larger space. We requested a room facing away from the street (based on this website's advice) which meant we didn't have a view from our room, but it was nice and quiet. Everything was very clean, both in the room and in the public spaces. The free breakfast in the dining room was typical of what we found in other Italian hotels we stayed at on this trip--rolls, cereals, toast, yogurt, juice, and coffee. We arrived late in the evening and were greeted by a charming gentleman working the night shift who spoke perfect English and answered all our questions about getting around town, making international phone calls, etc. All in all, I highly recommend the Lombardi Hotel. So, you may be wondering why I give this hotel only a 4 rating instead of a 5. Well, there was a problem with the hot water. We found it to be barely adequate for a short shower before it started cooling off. As long as you're not the kind of person who likes to take a half hour steamy shower, this should only be a small inconvenience. Other than that, if you're traveling on a budget, the Hotel Lombardi is a good choice. I'd stay there again on my next trip to Italy.
