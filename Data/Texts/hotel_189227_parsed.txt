<Content>loved the location, the staff, and the ambiance of the hotel The hotel was wonderful, and it complimented the overall charm of Paris. The location was great, and we were able to walk almost the entire city from the hotel. The staff were marvelous--always ready to help, even w/ minor things. The only problem was that the room had two double beds rather than a queen.

<Content>Our new favourite hotel on the Left Bank! We stayed at this hotel for the first time for 3 nights in December, 2008. My wife and I visit Paris frequently and we almost exclusively stay on the Left Bank. We have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels either in the Latin Quarter or St Germain de Pres area. This hotel is in our view the best hotel for overall quality of room, location, service, and value for money. We stayed in a standard room which was typically small but pretty and clean. It was incredibly quiet. The only negative was the bed was a little uncomfortable, particularly the pillows. The location was outstanding near Le Bon Marche and St. Supulce. Service was great and friendly. We will stay here again!

<Content>great staff at the Hotel de l Abbaye Excellent hotel The staff were so helpful and it could not have been a better stay . We have stayed in many hotels in Paris and this was the best. We loved all the little details including excellent breakfasts facing the garden terrace with English newspapers . The staff also gave us wonderful reccomendations for dining close to the hotel on Christmas day.

<Content>not really kid friendly we booked two rooms for a family holiday with our two young children. rooms are clean and quaint, location is good, but a few problems we encountered: no mini fridges in the rooms. not sure if this is common all over paris, but for the price, we were a bit surprised at this. as last reviewer mentioned, they were STINGY. apart from the breakfast, which he mentioned, we had two rooms in total, paying over $1,600 on our accomodation in total and we got one bottle of Evian water on the first day each per room- it was never replenished. they also do not provide shampoo at the hotel either, only bath gel. its pretty rough on the hair! Stingy is okay when you are paying stingy for the rooms, but here not!and lastly, service incident to end our trip left a sour taste- we had already checked out and were killing time in the very parlour downstairs. i asked the receptionist if she could help warm up my kids milk for us. 15 min later, i knew the milk would be too hot for the kids to drink, so asked two different people to bring out the milk- no response- 5 people milling around reception, everyone seems too busy to bother with our milk. another 5 minutes later and the milk comes out, and as predicted too hot to even hold. lady said ca va? and i replied that it was too hot, she says in french, well, you'll just have to leave it out and wait then ...turned on her heels and stormed off, clearly annoyed and not interested in helping me anymore to get my kids their milk. nice touch.all maybe normal for paris, but for the price, not exactly impressive... its redeeming quality is that there are two (and only two!) very very friendly and helpful staff at the hotel- too bad not everyone there is...

<Content>Paris is still magical Although an indulgent overnight stay turned out to be an extremely expensive one as the pound plummeted, the hotel is hard to fault in terms of convenience, peacefulness, cleanliness and comfort. What a pity they are stingy enough to make guests pay extra for anything more than coffee and croissants at breakfast! Grim coffee, too! J  B

<Content>Quite, clean and romantic After reading these reviews I booked a room in this hotel and spent with my wife 2 nights starting 12th December in this lovely hotel. The fact that it is so close to St. Germain and the beautiful boutiques and restaurants and all that live stuff but still is a quiet retreat was a big advantage. All the rest was already written by other users : the winter garden, wonderful decoration, fireplace, very friendly staff. We found even the price for standard room ok for Paris hotel rates. The room was quite big. The only missing thing is indeed the shower.... but who cares !! We will for sure come back to there for summer !

<Content>too special Read the reviews, looked at the pictures, then booked a 3 night stay in a Superior room for my wife and I on the hotel website. About $450+/night. Wow, can't wait.Upon arrival, My first impression was that a lot of people put a lot of time, money and thought into this place. Drinks by the fireplace anyone? In Paris? with carpet, velvet couches surrounded by original sculpture and master paintings!? Very special indeed.Our room #2 was on the ground floor adjacent to the sitting / tv room. Thoughtful and clever designs throughout. Very comfy but non-supportive euro type bed. Fancy hot shower with no tub (which I prefer). Toilet was squeezed into a separate tiny closet, cool but tight for my long frame. Wonderful personal sitting/greenhouse with access to our own garden, awesome! All of this lead to great -you know what- on the first night and morning, 5-star fantastic.breakfast was simple but good, anything extra costs extra....why charge 5 euro for an omlette when you pay 100 times that per night? silly.Overall we liked our stay but the $ vs. the goods don't make this above average for us.Better for rich older people....like the ones peering at us, while we were grinning at breakfast.

The addition of a varied menu for light meals and late-night snacks is a real plus.Why stay anywhere else? A bit expensive, but worth it to be well-taken care of.

<Content>The only place I'll stay in Paris We've now stayed at L'Abbaye 4 times, and I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Paris. The neighbourhood, St Germain de Pres, is fantastic, a nice walk to most places you want to see, with a lot of great shopping and restaurants within minutes. The hotel itself is really lovely and charming, tucked back in a quiet courtyard off the main street. We never wanted to leave the lobby/reception/bar area, with it's great conservatory that opens onto a beautiful little garden. The rooms are small - typical for Paris - but are beautifully decorated and very comfortable, with good size bathroom, closets, televistion. The service is absolutely impeccable. Everyone is friendly and you can tell they want you to feel at home and have a great time. I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>L'Abbaye Saint-Germain is excellent This is the third time we've stayed at the Hotel de l'Abbaye. This time we had a large room (room 2) which was quite spectacular. We had our own small conservatory and courtyard! The public areas in the hotel provide a lovely environment with a cosy fire-side area, an area with small tables where you can sit and eat. drink or just read, a lovely conservatory which is ideal for having breakfast and a picturesque garden area (where you can smoke!) The service is impeccable and non-intrusive. The hotel is spotlessly clean. There is no restaurant but there is a very good, if simple, snack menu which is served throughout the day. The staff are extremely polite and friendly. I have stayed in about 10 different hotels in Paris and this one is by far the best. Although it is not cheap (our room cost 350 EUR per night), you really do feel that you are getting value for money. The location is also excellent being close to Rue de Rennes, Montparnasse, Luxembourg and St Germain. We go to Paris once a year at least and have no plans to stay anywhere else!

<Content>Lived up to expectations! Due to the reviews oin Tripadvisor we chose this hotel for our 4-day stay in Paris.We arrived before the room was ready (checkin is 12.00 which anyway is quite early) but while waitng was served a coffee and croissant in the lobby. 12.15 we checked. Our room was somewhat small but in excellent shape. The hotel is just 50 m off the noisy streets but as soon as you enter it is quiet. We could sleep with our window open with no noise problem. How ofte do you find a quiet room in a major city.The breakfast room (Orangeri) with the beautiful garden is very nice.Due to an early flight we had to check-out before breakfast opened but the waiter arranged for us to have our breakfast 20 min before opening time. That warms.The hotel is located within walking distance to most of the must-sees. Near Quartier Latin with its busy night life.We will stay here next time we go to Paris

<Content>Gem of an hotel Having spent half my life in Paris and half in North America, I have come to appreciate the best of the 2 worlds.Hotel de l Abbaye Saint-Germain did not disapointed me. The location is perfect, in St-Germain des Pres, close to the Luxembourg. It is also 5 minutes from the metro, on a direct line to go to La Gare du Nord ( Eurostar ) and easy connection to Charles De Gaulle airport.The hotel is in a courtyard, on a quiet street ( very difficult to find in Paris ).The decor is enchanting. You feel more like home that in an hotel. NIcely decorated salons with a fireplace, a small garden, a conservatory where you enjoy a wonderfull continental breakfast.The rooms are also gorgeous. We were lucky to have a little terrasse overlooking the patio. So romantic.The bathroom was gorgeous , more american than european in style . It was spotless. No carpet in the bathroom (which is pretty common in France).The staff is absolutely wonderfull, charming, warm, competent.Totally unlike the reputation some of the Parisians are known for ( and I used to be Parisian).My husband an I have travelled around but I think I is the first time I fell in love with an hotel.I hope we will be able to go back soonAgain lovely place and wonderfull service

<Content>Loved Hotel de l'Abbaye Saint-Germain The Hotel de l'Abbaye Saint-Germain exceeded my expectations. I travel extensively and always research Trip Advisor to review real experiences of travelers along with their pictures that truly reflect the property. Based on previous reviews I felt this hotel would suit my needs in the area of Paris that I wished to stay. Hotel de l'Abbaye is located in the Saint Germain district of Paris and the various sites that I was interested in seeing were in walking distance. I was delighted upon my arrival to find the hotel spotless and staff welcoming. The large floor to ceiling window in my room opened overlooking a beautiful enclosed courtyard filled with much greenery and a babbling fountain. It was a very tranquil setting and much appreciated after days of traveling. The room provided a safe in one of the closets and locks on both closets. There was a flatscreen TV and all the amenities that a fine property provides. The bathroom was modern, roomy and clean along with a hairdryer. A continental breakfast was included in the room rate. Coffee or tea is freshly brewed and served in a lovely pot along with croissants, various breads, butter and jams. The servicer was very polite, friendly and enjoyed his job. He genuinely waited upon each person in the room as an honored guest. The front desk staff were very helpful with any question and/or request. I will definitely choose Hotel de l'Abbbaye again upon my future returns to Paris.

<Content>charming, helpful This is a lovely hotel. It's clean, and the service is excellent. Also, the staff were friendly and helpful. They recommend great restaurants, and are great about calling taxis for you, or making reservations, or getting other info.The hotel is a short walk from Parc Luxebourg - which is gorgeous. It's in St Germaine, which is a great shopping district (take a map! the streets are pretty confusing).The included breakfast consists of jam and croissants/other pastries, plus coffee or juice. They charge extra for menu items. Anyway, we were quite happy with the croissants.The breakfast room and lobby are super comfortable. The former overlooks a quaint courtyard and the latter is amply supplied with every variety of magazine and newspaper.The room itself is Paris-sized for sure, but we certainly didn't feel cramped. It's comfortable and clean, with a nice big bathtub.For its price range, I would certainly recommend the Abbaye.

<Content>What a wonderful place to stay ! What a wonderful place to stay. Charming ambience with delightful staff who are so eager to please whatever the request. Small but very adequate and well-maintained bedrooms and bathrooms and we felt like we were in a real home-from-home. The location is perfect for getting around Paris - very near to the Metro and buses and many excellent shops and restaurants nearby. La Maison du Jardin is a few minutes away and is a delightful restaurant which makes a great place to eat if you arrive in Paris tired and hungry ! And as you step into the quiet side street of rue Cassette, the hustle and bustle of Paris melt away. As they say in their brochure, the hotel is a haven of comfort, excellent service and elegance. We can't wait to return.

<Content>Great Charm and Gentility We arrived at the hotel at 8am, exhausted and rumpled from an all night flight across the Atlantic. The front desk, after appologizing that our room would not be ready til 1pm, immediately suggested we leave our baggage, utilize the lavatory facilities, send an email home announcing our arrival if we liked and enjoy a complimentary breakfast in the garden conservatory. Their attention and concern set the tone for our two night stay. While our room was small, it was nicely decorated, and quiet, overlooking their lovely garden. Their cafe au lait was the best we had during our 4 weeks in France. When I had a problem confirming a leased car, the desk staff helped me work through it. When I tried practicing my French, they politely answered in French. Since they all spoke excellent English, however, they also switched to English whenever I seemed confused or if I asked a question in English. The hotel's public space was cozy and charming, the location was great, the staff delightful. I would happily stay here again and recommend it to my friends.

The hotel was beautiful, peaceful, the staff outstanding. It was a treat to go to the lovely dining area overlooking a courtyard every morning for a continental breakfast included in the cost. We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Charming Hotel My 18 year old daughter and I just recently returned from a great trip to London  Paris. After having spent 4 nights in a dark, musty hotel in London(was advertised as a 4 star), Hotel de L' Abbaye was a wonderful refuge. When we arrived in Paris, we got completely turned around and could not find our original hotel I had reservations at. Lionel was so gracious and accommodating, he had a room ready for us in five minutes! The location could not have been better. We were close to the Metro and the Latin Quarter. My daughter really enjoyed the festive atmosphere there! Yes the rooms are small, but so comforting, especially after a jammed packed day of sightseeing. We opened our window at night and slept to the sounds of the fountain below in the beautiful courtyard. Even after all of the exhausting days, when I returned home I felt relaxed and peaceful!Tip: Try the Chic Pizza down the street from the hotel at the corner. Great staff and wonderful pizza.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great position, rooms, garden, staff My wife and I spent 6 days at Hotel l'Abbaye, which we chose for two reasons; a friend of ours stayed there and recommended it highly and we lived next door (in an apartment) for 6 months and love the area. The hotel was excellent and we will stay there every time we are in Paris in future (finances permitting, it isn't cheap). The area is wonderful, a very quiet street but in the heart of St Germain des Pres a hop skip and a jump from the bustle of rue des Cannettes, the boutiques of Bd St Germain and the fabulous Luxembourg Gardens - and one minute to the metro and the buses (tip, use the buses in Paris if you can, they are cheap, regular and give you a great view of the city, and very easy to use).We paid for a slightly larger room and it was worth is - elegant, comfortable and a home away from home. The staff were excellent, the breakfast room, with its ivy covered courtyard and fountain are to die for, the breakfast is wonderful and the drinks and meals are surprisingly affordable and very nice.If you do stay I strongly recommend Cafe Cassette (particularly the salmon), just on the corner of rue Cassette and rue des Rennes, and the boulangerie one block up rue des Rennes is packed with locals getting their baguatte traditions and is a delight.OK, I'm biased, I love Paris, I love St Germain and I love rue Cassette but if you want a great hotel in the heart of the Left Bank action, yet a peaceful haven, you won't do better.One last tip - Positano in rue des Cannettes (just of Place St Sulpice) is a great Italian/pizza place, but get there at 7pm when it opens to avoid the queues.

<Content>Great little hotel Stayed for a long weekend having picked the hotel due to the high rating on Tripadvisor and we were definitely not disappointed. It is true that the location is not super prime but being only a 5 minute walk from Boulevard St Germain one could hardly say it is in the sticks.The ground floor and reception area are nicely decorated and there is a pleasant courtyard to the rear where you can have your evening aperitif. The staff on the front desk were very helpful but we were a little jaded that when we asked for a typical French restaurant we got sent somewhere that was filled with tourists, we could have done that on our own!The rooms are not huge but then again for this price they are above the Parisien average. They are very well decorated and appointed although missing a mini bar / water in the room which should be an automatic for a 4 star hotel.Breakfast is served in the living room and courtyard on the ground floor and is good (Fresh bread and pasteries with a payment extra menu for other) and the service is fine although a little slow. There are also papers in the morning.Overall we had a great experience.

<Content>An Oasis In the City Just returned from a 5 day stay. The hotel is clean and charming. Standard rooms are small, but, not by European Standards. Bathrooms are completely updated and clean. The lobby and bar are charming. A Parsienne breakfast, bread and coffee is included in the stay. You can find many cafe's along the streets near by if you need more. There are also a la carte eggs other breakfast items if you wish. We never ate lunch or tea at the hotel, but it is avaiable. For a small hotel they also have room service. The highlight is the courtyard breakfast and the quite street. We felt like we had our own town house in Paris. The hotel is a short walk to Jardin du Luxembourg and great shopping. Bon Marche is also a short walk. It is about a 15 minute stroll to Notre Dame and Ille de la cite. While we walked to the champs-elysees and Jardin Tuileries it would be about a 10 euro cab ride. Last year I stayed at the Palais de la Reine in the Place des Vosges. I would reccommend this hotel and area over the Marias any day. Take a cab to the Marais and see the busy streets but stay in the quiet relaxing atmosphere of the L'Abbaye. Also a great place for dinner the hotel reccommend is Maison du Jardin a quik walk around the corner. Right outside the door is Pizza Chic a family friendly great wood grilled pizza place.

<Content>Wish I could have loved it more The property is very beautiful and has fabulous common areas and yes, breakfast is fantastic - esp outside in the courtyard. The people who serve breakfast are really nice - great service.The location really isn't that great compared to other Paris 6/7 properties. It's on a non-descript side street that leads into another non-descript side street that is then off a busy avenue or two - it is near St. Sulpice but there are hotels that are closer to the Seine, the heart of St. Germain and the Luxembourg gardens.It is very expensive for what you get - we booked a suite and what qualified as a suite was pretty funny even for Paris standards - it was basically a large room but with enough space for two chairs and a desk. We frequently stay at another nearby hotel that really provides a suite for a similar price to what we paid.Service (breakfast) was great but I agree with comments about reception. In particular there was a gentleman with no hair and glasses (the only one) who was downright rude to us. They won't win any service awards.

<Content>Stuffy, overpriced 4 star My 18 year old daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights. Bedore this hotel we stayed for 10 nights at a 3 star hotel in the Marais district. We were dissappointed with the d Abbaye hotel. The rooms are very small. There was no bar fridge. No bottles of water in the room. The reception staff were quite rude to my daughter on a few occasions. We needed to keep some things food items in the fridge and were made to feel quite uncomfortable about this. The breakfast was basically bread and little else; I put patries in the same category as bread. No tea making facilities either. The beds were very uncomfortable as were the pillows. Breakfast was served in a small dining area that was rather stuffy though quaint I guess.I am comparing this hotel with the Marais 3 star property. Ok the Marais is noiser when you go out on the street but the actual room was not. Despite being a 3 star hotel, the room was very spacious and at least had a bar fridge and a kettle AS WELL which was great.Would not recommend Hotel d Abbaye for anyone else than older couples. Definitely not for families or anyone that wants to keep even a bottle of Perrier cold in their room. I noticed that this hotel recently became a 4 star property. Perhaps they are still trying to wrk out what 4-star actually means.

The staff was courteous and helpful and was just a pleasure to interact with. Everyone spoke English, or at least enough for my wife and I to have no problem communicating with the hotel staff. The facility was lovely, with a beautiful courtyard, fountain, and outdoor dining area. We especially enjoyed the birds at breakfast, which literally ate bread out of our hands in the courtyard. The room was delightful and done in great taste, as were all the hotel furnishings. The windows of our room opened to the courtyard, which was quiet and peaceful. It could not have been a more attractive and pleasant setting. If I had one thing to do over, I would have upgraded to a room with a shower rather than just a bathtub, but even the bathroom was well done.The hotel is conveniently located at the boundaries of the Latin Quarter, Luxemburg Gardens, and St. Germain, off a quiet side street a couple of blocks from the Saint Sulpice Metro stop.Thus it is convenient to most of city center Paris, especially LeftBank activities. I would go back any chance I had to stay at de l' Abbaye! It was truly a terrific experience for us.

<Content>great choice for my family Based on reviews I read on the tripadvisor website I chose this property for my family in Paris. It was an excellent choice. The hotel was perfect! Clean, quiet, close to the metro, and had all the amenties we needed. The staff was excellent and very polite. They were always willing to help. We booked two rooms as our two teenage sons accompanied us on this family vacation. We would definately stay at the Hotel L'Abbaye again and would recommend it to all of our friends. The hotel had a beautiful courtyard where breakfast was served every morning (included). The rooms were on the small side but we did not find this to be a drawback. Who wants to stay in the room when you're in Paris anyway. A self service bike rental station was at the end of the block and the metro station was only around the corner. A perfect way to get around Paris.

<Content>A Parisian Hotel, as you've always imagined it would be! This hotel really is as we all imagine Paris could be, small, intimate and chic. Professional, discreet staff not rude or dare I say, Parisien at all! All the comforts of a big chain but lovely charm too, right down to the 1/2lb in weight brass door key.Stayed in the smallest room as all that was left, and it was absolutely great. So well designed felt bigger. Breakfast very carbs orientated, but still my brioche this morning was still warm.........beat that!!Definatley the ONLY hotel I will consider on my return to Paris later in the year.Deserves its high rating.

<Content>Now a **** 4 star hotel This was my third visit to the Hotel de l'Abbaye and it was better than ever. It deserves to have the 4th star. Excellent accomodations, decor, location, staff and value. The breakfast was simple and good. The shrinking dollar was a little shocking, but the pleasures of this hotel and Paris made it worthwhile.

<Content>Good on the whole Good on the whole. Room was nice. Location was very good - in nice, smart area of the left bank and very near to the metro and good bus routes. Communal areas of the hotel were very nice, especially the nice courtyard with a fountain. Receiption staff were very polite. Quality of breakfast food and drink was excellent. Service at breakfast was hit and miss. On our last day, we had to wait 35 minutes to get served (even though all they have to do is take your order for drinks, then bring you a basket of croissants etc). Other people, who had arrived much later than us, were served before us and we had to complain. However, it would not put me off staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Gorgeous hotel My partner and I stayed in a room in the lowest price category, and it my have, in fact, been the worst room in the hotel--but that certainly doesn't mean it was unacceptable. The room was on the ground floor, with a window onto a dark, enclosed cement courtyard, next to the kitchen. It was very warm in the room (even in April), so we had to keep the window open, but they are very good about the noise, and it was not a problem. The bed was very small for two men of average size--I am accustomed to European travel, and this was a particularly small double bed. This room cost 230 Euros, and would have been well-priced at $1=1E, but at $1.60 to the Euro, it was perhaps not a great value. We inquired, and larger beds are available in the next price category. If you have the money, go for it.What you do get is a superb location on the Left Bank (we walked to everything--but we like walking) and an immaculate hotel with superior service. The absolute best part was petit-dejeuner every morning on the glassed-in terrace overlooking the private garden. It was the most enjoyable breakfast service I have ever had in a hotel--fast, efficient, and delicious. The decor in the lobby is very old world, but the rooms are more minimal (but well-decorated, not hyper-modern, but classic charm) We stayed 4 nights, and had a great time.

<Content>Perfection! We are regular visitors to Paris and have been searching for that perfect place to stay for years. There are a number of hotels we have liked very much, but each one had some drawback (too far from places we like to visit, or, too noisy, or, unfriendly staff, or decor that was not in line with what we like, etc.). So...we kept searching and, this year, found Hotel de l'Abbaye. It is perfection and we plan to make it our home away from home in Paris from now on. The management and staff are so friendly and helpful, the Saint Sulpice neighborhood is convenient and lovely, the common rooms and garden are beautiful, the room we had was excellent, the breakfast was delicious...I could go on and on. There is that divine birdsong to gently nudge you awake in the morning, for instance! We thoroughly enjoyed the concert at Saint Sulpice too...the church is a place so imbued with history and beauty that we have always liked to visit it whenever we could...to be so near to it and in such a wonderful hotel was heaven. We definitely did not want to leave when it was time to go and can't wait for our next stay in Paris.

<Content>Hotel LAbbaye was pure magic! I stayed at the Hotel L'Abbaye St Germain for 3 nights in June 08. From the moment I entered the hotel I knew that it would be special. The concierge was very welcoming and very helpful as were all of the hotel staff. The room, which had a view over the idyllic courtyard (more later), was spacious, very clean and had air conditioning. Each morning breakfast was served in the courtyard at the back of the hotel by extremely pleasant staff. It was amazing. Despite being in the heart of Paris, the only sounds were of birds chirping and water flowing from the water feature. The hotel was very close (2-3 min walk) to the St. Sulpice Metro stop (Line 4), and there was also a very good Parisian Cafe at the corner of the street with Rue de Rennes. The stay at this hotel made my holiday special and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to other travellers.

<Content>Loving l'Abbaye Hotel l'Abbaye came highly recommended and lived up to expectations. The room although small was exquisitely presented in beautiful Parisian style overlooking a lovely courtyard with a well designed and appointed bathroom.The common rooms and courtyard gave a feeling of staying in a beautiful house and the friendly staff only excentuated that sense.The area was central and quiet while being in short walking distance to the busiest and jumping area of Paris. Local cafes and supermarkets were also a great advantage.m+m walsh. Sydney, Australia

<Content>Romantic Hideaway Well located hotel where everything seems to work perfectly with the minimum of fuss. The staff were friendly and helpful and the facilities were very good. The standard room we booked overlooked the front courtyard and was just large enough but felt bigger because everything in the room was placed in just the right spot. Unlike the previous four hotels I have stayed in France this hotel has also figured out how to stop the shower flooding the bathroom floor - important if you are using it after someone else. Breakfast with the papers - local or international - in the rear courtyard was a perfect start to the day. While we didn't use the lounge and bar area a lot it was very inviting and well stocked with books and magazines. When we got back to the hotel each evening it felt like you were coming home to a very tranquil and romantic hideaway. I haven't uploaded any photos. If you look at the website what you see is what we got.

<Content>Hotel de l'Abbaye is the best! We arrived at this quaint little hotel for a one night stop coming from Italy on the way to the US. My cousin and I (2 women) had already been in France for 10 days and Italy for 5 days. The hotel is located in a great area of Paris with terrific shopping. It is close to Saint-Sulpice and within walking distance of The Louvre. The hotel staff was excellent and upgraded our room to a suite which was wonderful. Hotel l'Abbaye is quiet and peaceful with a beautiful garden terrace out back where we ate breakfast the next morning.

Walking is easy to the major galleries and then into the heart of the city.

We can recomend a stay in this four star hotel to anyonne who wants that little bit more for your money on a visit to Paris

<Content>Anniversary Trip The Hotel Abbaye was a great selection. If you are trying to select a hotel on line you know how many there are to choose from and our choice was magnificent. The staff was great from the time we arrived to when we left. The front desk helped with directions, restaurants, etc. All of the staff was courteous, efficient and accomadating. Close to the metro - two lines within 2 - 5 minutes easy walk. Great courtyard garden that allowed you to awake to the sound of singing birds. Quiet and peaceful. You didn't even realize you were in a major city. I can't say enough about how pleased we were.

<Content>Perfect location, perfect service, perfect hotel I stayed here for a business trip March 22-28, the room booked by my employer鈥檚 travel unit. The hotel鈥檚 4 stars are fairly earned. While there are only about 40 or so rooms, there seems to be a higher ratio of employees to rooms than some other similarly sized hotels. The concierges, bar staff, and other employees were world-class: always professional, pleasant, helpful, and informative. The hotel is beautiful, clean, and well maintained, but the service is even better. I stayed in room #2, on the ground floor, which looks in the small, perfect garden. This room had a small dining nook set out into the garden and a door leading to a patio that would be perfect for breakfast in warmer weather. The hotel was completely insulated from any street noise. I鈥檝e been to Paris dozens of times, but have always stayed in different hotels鈥攖his hotel might be my favorite and I will certainly return to it.

It is situated in the St Germain area 2 minutes walk form St Sulpice metro station or 10 minutes walk from the south bank of the river. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. Always very polite and courteous. The rooms were very clean, comfortable and well furnished. In general - we would recommend the hotel to anyone for its peaceful, out of the way, yet ideal location.

<Content>Very close to perfect I will tell you what I was looking for and I think you will see that the Hotel de L'Abbaye Saint-Germain came very close to being perfect. My husband prefers a 5 star hotel that has American type amenities like a stall shower and big screen TVs. My daughter and I don't care about the stars, we want something with personality, charm and lots of nearby strolling opportunities. We booked two rooms - one standard, which had two twin beds and a bath with handheld shower. Very charming, very comfortable - a little roomier than the European standard. The other room was a suite and it was just huge! It was actually a duplex with one floor having a small parlor with TV, couch, easy chair, desk and a full bath with tub and shower stall. The upstairs had a very roomy bedroom, queen size bed, half bathroom (just a toilet /sink) and a terrace that looked over the courtyard with two chairs and a table. Charming!!!! And the bathroom turned out to be my husband's favorite ever - heated floor in the shower, real water pressure, gorgeous marble. Not to mention that all TVs were large, flat panel. I heartily agree with previous posts that mention how very special the service is, on this level they can compete with any 5 star. And the public spaces for breakfast / evening cocktail / relaxation are great too. One very small criticism - the beds were just average in terms of comfort. The mattresses were quite firm and the sheets had that starched feeling, something I thought had gone out of style a long time ago. We had stayed at a Sofitel in Dijon the night before and while that is a very businessy hotel, the beds were incredible. Since Sofitel sells these mattresses through a brochure, I would suggest that the L'Abbaye grab a few of them ASAP.Well worth the price, even the upgrade cost for the suite.

<Content>Will go back to l'Abbaye St-Germain I have stayed at similar hotels in Paris (4-star boutique hotels) and concluded that l'Abbaye St-Germain offers the best deal. Rooms, although compact, are well layed-out and have space (desk, table) for your computer (wireless internet, available at cost, working well).Location is also a factor, in the 5th arrondissement, walking distance to St-Germain and Boul. St-Michel, and to pretty well all the center of Paris. In my view what really sets them apart from others is their breakfast: nothing like starting the morning with cafe au lait served under their smaill but cosy glass gallery or in summer their adjacent terrasse, and served always promptly and with a smile.A friend had recommended it to me; I like the place and will likely be back.

<Content>The Jewel of the Left Bank My wife and I visited Paris for the first time this month and stayed at the Hotel L'Abbaye. We absolutely loved it! The moment I walked in the front door I felt at home. Our room overlooked the small court yard in the back and it had these beautiful crank out windows that we could crack open and wake up to the birds singing every morning. It was great! The room was very clean and considerably spacious for a smaller hotel. The cleaning service was like clock work everyday, cleaning the room and also providing turn down service in the evening. The common areas of the hotel are the highlight. The sitting area by the fireplace is beautiful and the court yard with the small water fountain is very tranquil if the weather is warm enough to sit out there. There is ample sitting areas where you have breakfast in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening. The staff at this hotel is extremely professional and accomodating. They were very helpful with restuarant reservations and any other questions we had. I thought they were all very warm and friendly, especially Daniel who works the night shift.I highly recommend this hotel and think this is one of the better hotels I have stayed at. I think the location is perfect because it is off the beat and path which makes it quiet but you are just a five minute walk from Boulevard Saint Germain and the Metro. This is a fantastic hotel in a fantastic city!RonDuxbury, MA

<Content>Lovely hotel My wife and I visited Paris for 2 nights at Valentines 2008. It was our first visit to Paris together and we wanted to stay somehere special so we chose the lovely Hotel de l'Abbaye Saint Germain since it was recommended in our AA guide book and had virtually universal acclaim on Trip Advisor.Although close to the cafes and restaurants of Saint Germain and even closer to the useful Saint Sulpice metro station (and only about 10 minutes walk to the Seine), the hotel is an oasis of peace and quiet set around a lovely little courtyard.We paid extra for a large room and had a delightful ground floor room with its own little conservatory (containing 2 chairs and table with fruit basket) and its own little garden (with another 2 chairs and table), both of which overlooked the courtyard. Despite being in the heart of the city the only noise we could hear was birdsong!The staff are all friendly and helpful and speak perfect English (but were also prepared to humour my attempts to communicate with them in French!) and we would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay somewhere a bit special. Breakfast in the main conservatory is recommended (try the hot chocolate, it may not sound particularly breakfasty but is to die for, trust me!) as is afternoon tea in the lounge (in front of a real fire if like us you visit during the winter months).Beyond the hotel we only had time to do the cheesy touristy things (Louvre, Bateaux Mouches cruise, up the Eiffel Tower, dinner/show at the Lido, walks along the Seine), all of which were hugely enjoyable and are highly recommended, but hardly hidden gems!!All in all, a perfect escape!!

<Content>A Gem in the Saint-Germain I have stayed at the Hotel de l'Abbaye perhaps 4-5 times over the past two years. (I would have stayed more often, but it can be hard to book at times.) It is a gem of a boutique hotel! Set back in its own courtyard off the rue Cassette, it is a private oasis about a block and a half off the rue de Rennes. All of the sights of the left bank/Saint-Germain are within 10-20 minutes walks.The hotel has a very intimate, friendly feel. The staff always make me feel welcome - almost like you were visiting someone's home.The rooms are small, as is typical in France/Europe, but the bathrooms are modern and the furnishings first rate. (If you are tall, like me, be sure to ask whether the room has a shower - some only have bathtubs.)The hotel has limited food service: breakfast and a light lunch. But the coffee and croissants are great. I would return just for the coffee.

<Content>l'Abbaye is spectacular Small and comfortable. No shower curtain/door but thats a European thing from what I have been told. The mattress was a little soft but the service was absolutely spectacular. The dinning room was an indoor/outdoor sunroom that was perfect for morning breakfast and coffee before exploring the city. Exploring the city was made easy by the hotels location and easy access to many lines on the metro. Spectacular location, very professional and courteous help, and very clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel as the place to stay for the price range.

<Content>A wonderful boutique hotel We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel de l'Abbaye for 6 days over the New Year holiday. There were large floral arrangements of white amarylis and white hyacinths all throughout the lobby which was one of the little touches that were so wonderful in this hotel. The breakfast area looked out onto a well designed garden area displayed with red cyclamen, white daffodils, and more hyacinths. This hotel makes you feel special and relaxed because of these eye-pleasing touches. The staff was always polite, welcoming and very efficient and helpful with our varied questions. Our room was one of the apartment rooms and we had quite a large bathroom with a shower and a bath. The housekeeping service was very good, and we were happy with our room which had an upstairs bedroom and downstairs living area. We hope to return again in the future.

A typical French continental breakfast was included. Although we had a standard room that is quite small by any measure, it was attractively decorated (this being Paris) with an efficient layout. We thought the hotel offered a very good value for the money and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Enjoyed L'Abbaye once again The hotel is absolutely gorgeous. The downstairs area is especially charming - set out like an elegant French home with fresh flowers, a fireplace(great for chilly winter days) and comfortable lounges. The back garden with fountain is beautiful. The staff are helpful and willingly speak English. Its located close to many of Paris's main attractions notably the Louvre, Decorative arts Museum (both 20 mins walk away), Musee de Cluny (10-15mins), Notre Dame, good restaurants (do try Le Petit Cours) and leading fashion stores. My only quibble is that I find the beds very hard. Also as I have partner the twin beds pushed together rather than a queen sized bed makes sleeping together a bit uncomfortable. Don't know of this is the same in all rooms.

<Content>A wonderful little hotel This was a wonderful little hotel, beautifully located with exceptional service. Especially wonderful were the continental breakfasts, which are served anytime after 7 in a beautiful room with a coutyard/garden view. The hotel is exceptionally clean and very nicely appointed. The staff were attentive and helpful. The only negative is that we were given an icredibly tiny double room upon arrival, so small that there was not even room for the suitcases, and with not a single drawer of storage space. But the hotel staff happily moved us to a larger (but not especially spacious) room after we complained. The baths are nice but small, often with a tub but without shower. So if you don't mind a cozy room, this is a wonderful place to stay.

<Content>Paris December 2007 Very good welcome and service generally - we were however very surprised to find a person sleeping in the area for the television on the ground floor outside our room! This did not seem at all appropriate for this standard of hotel - but everything else was excellent.

<Content>A wonderful stay Hotel provides the perfect sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of St-Germain. Within easy walking distance of most major attractions - Louvre, the Seine, Notre Dame etc. Welcoming log fires and comfy sofas. Excellent staff, always friendly and helpful - good English spoken. Good quality continental breakfast served in conservatory dining room overlooking the courtyard. Bedroom not huge but well equipped and good for a big city hotel. Looking forward to our return visit.

<Content>Best Hotel in Paris! Stay all over the world and nothing compares to your staff! I had seen this hotel when I was living in Paris in the 90's and thought it quite charming. This is my favorite neighborhood in all the city. But, nothing can compare to the facilities and the staff in your hotel. I stay all over the world and have never stayed in such a quiet, perfect, serene location. It has reminded me of how much I miss about French culture and inspired me to plan a long-stay summer trip with you this year. I have missed Paris. I plan to communicate my pleasure with both Michelin and Conde Nast Traveller as I think this boutique hotel is far under rated. I was treated as if I stayed at Hotel de l'Abbaye on a regular basis. I shudder to think what is done for those who do. I could not have felt more welcome or comfortable. You are running a top ship and very fortunate to have the staff you do. And I mean ALL your staff. I could go on and on, but I fear I shall run out of space. Thank you to everyone for a lovely stay and for reminding me how very much I love Paris. I owe it all to you!

<Content>Charming for Americans on a budget! Hotel de L'Abbaye offered a relatively large room for a European hotel,, with a full bath and shower (yippee). The staff was very friendly and accomodating and attended to all o four needs immediately (eg empty wine glasses for our own wine, a bed made up for 2 married people rather than 2 female friends traveling together, etc.). I would definitely stay there again if the dollar continues to be as worthless as it is!!!

<Content>Long Weekend at the St Germain Hotel de l'Abbaye Saint-Germain it is very nicely located, near Saint Sulpice and St Germain churches, Luxembourg Palace and it鈥檚 beautiful gardens and many other lovely places within walking distance, such as Notre Dame, Monparnasse Cemetery, it is very charming and the decoration it is lovely. The room was a bit small, but it was so charming you forget about it. We took advantage of the nice sitting rooms downstairs, the fireplace, the winter garden overlooking the small garden and it鈥檚 fountain. We have paid 鈧?215 breakfast included.The staff was nice too. A place to be back. 14 to 19 November 2007

<Content>Wonderful stay at Hotel de l'Abbaye Saint-Germain The Hotel de l'Abbaye Saint-Germain is wonderful. It is very quiet with an off the street location but all of the key sites are in easy walking distance. The rooms are lovely and comfortable. The staff was friendly, helpful and provided great suggestions on local Restaurants. After a busy day on business or site seeing the hotel is a great place to return. I have stayed at several different hotels in Paris over the years and the Hotel de l'Abbaye Saint-Germain is now my favorite.

<Content>Perfect place to spend your time in Paris My wife and I are well traveled and have stayed in many hotels-The Abbaye is a real gem. Small-quiet and discreet-staff friendly and more than helpful. Quiet court-yards set the hotel back from the street-muffles the street noise-trust me-it 's great. Breakfast waiters charming. Did not experience any of the French rudeness that you always hear about in the states. Location is just around the corner from St. Sulpice Church in the 6th-you can walk everywhere and if your feet get tired-take the Paris Metro-St. Sulpice Metro Stop around the corner from the hotel. Typical bistros and shops surround the hotel-plenty of choices to pick from for dinner.We splurged on the duplex suite-it was the type of charming room you always hear about-comfortable bed-(2 twins pushed together)-some people complain about that-but in fact-it is very common in Europe-so get over yourselves for those who complain about this set-up. Remember-we find these small older buildings charming-remember that they had to work around old walls etc to modernize the rooms-expect that you'll find things about the room that might not make sense-but take in the whole experience-the hotel will not disappoint. I remember reading a comment written by a former guest who complained about the size of the elevator-I mean-really-so it is small-the hotel only has 4 floors-you are in it for a minute. GEES.For those who criticize this place-stay at a modern Holiday Inn--you don't deserve to stay here.

<Content>At Last - Our Perfect Paris Hotel A courtyard entrance, a rear garden, clean comfortable rooms, discreet personal service, peace and quiet - if this suits you as it suits us, this is the place for you.In a quiet road in St-Germain close to the shops but a reasonable distance away the L'Abbaye is an oasis.Breakfast is very simple. A hot drink of choice with orange juice and a basket of bread, pastries and preserves served in the lounge and conservatory on the ground floor.There is no restaurant. We were guided to (and booked in at )the excellent La Maison du Jardin 27 rue de Vaugirard 200 yards from the hotel. A small local restaurant serving excellent food at good prices 25euros for two courses, 30 euros for three, house wine at 9euros per 50cl. Other wines well-priced.

<Content>Fantastic hotel We stayed at this hotel twice while traveling through France. The location is close to the Luxembourg Garden on quiet side street. The staff is very helpful and kind. Breakfast is available in a warm series of rooms or the garden. The staff will gladly bring coffee (with rolls and fresh juice) to your room in the morning. During our first stay we we were in room 42 on the top floor. It looked over the garden and was quite comfortable. On the second stay we were in room 3 on the reception floor. Room 3 includes a sun room built into the garden.

The staff will speak English if you do and will speak French if you do, even if you speak poorly. The Amex bill will floor you on return, but there is no better place to stay in Paris.

<Content>Loved the Abbaye Saint-Germain We stayed here for a week in May 2007. A perfect location, quiet elegant hotel, prompt and kind service, with a good breakfast in a lovely location. We had room #4 with a patio with chair and table. Close to Metro and on a quiet street. The only thing we did not like here is the lack of shower as the tub had only a hose spray. Staff spoke English if you so desired and the room was always cleaned promptly and very well. Can't say enough positive things. This is a quiet place, probably not for families or loud people. We are a 50 somthing couple and this suited quite well. They also made all our dinner reservations via email prior to our arrival (from our selections). Arrangements were all seemless. Will stay here again as soon as we can get back.

<Content>Beaucoup d'Americans! No longer a secret I have long loved the Hotel de l'Abbaye for its central St-Germain-des-Pres location, charming rooms, personal service. My husband and I just spent a week here April 14-22. Everything was as lovely as ever and I do recommend this hotel whole-heartedly, though it's so popular it's getting awfully hard to book a room these days! My only major gripe: during our stay, the property was overrun, literally, with loud Americans. One group in particular crowded the rather petite breakfast room, pushing together the small tables to create space for 7 people, thus denying a spot for other guests who wanted to breakfast. The rest of us were forced to wait while their table stood half empty. And is it too much to use indoor voices? Americans -- please note that your voices do indeed carry and I, for one, don't want to hear about your upcoming shopping trips to J. Crew while I'm on a romantic weekend away with my husband. Also, it's inconsiderate to stand about talking in the hall and slamming doors when the doors are quite thin. I realize that this post seems a bit curmudgeonly, but the hidden Hotel de l'Abbaye is no longer a secret -- particularly among loud-voiced, middle-aged American women from North Carolina. If you have a low threshold for irritation, avoid. I've realized that I need to start looking for another secret hotel.

<Content>Paris charm My daughter and I were guests April 10-16. I had looked extensively for the right hotel and was so pleased with the l'abbaye! Everyone was friendly and accomodating. Upon arrival the type room (large twindouble) was not available, so the first night we spent in a duplex suite. It was sooo charming. I toyed with the idea of staying there. Sensibility prevailed, and the next morning we moved to the room expected. It too was lovely. There was enough room for storage as well as a small couch and coffee table where we had our breadfast a number of mornings. One disappointment was the common rooms were under refurbishment, so things were not perfect, however this was minor really. There is a lovely garden and lounge area. Each day we made it a point to relax a bit at the end of the day or in the late afternoon. I recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to experience a bit of Paris charm. Enjoy this magnificent city. It is truly the city of Lights.!!

<Content>Picture Perfect! Just returned from a week in Paris with a day trip to Brugge, Belgium. Many thanks to Trip advisor for helping us find this Gem!! From our previous trip we knew that we wanted to stay on the Left Bank in Ste. Germain, but just didn't know where to begin looking for great accomodations for a family of 4. Contacted the hotel directly after much research and was able to get a great rate for two connecting rooms. Web site was great, and still didn't do justice to how quaint and friendly this hotel was. Staff couldn't do enough for us...ended up with an upgrade to what they considered an apartment (actually they were two rooms but the entire unit had it's own private entrance). Our favorite waiter greeted us each morning with croissants, baguettes, and coffee from heaven (included in room rate). The feel of the inn was more that of an oversized BB which was just great. Rooms were of course small by our American standards, but actually spacious for Europe. Very clean, modern bathrooms with overhead showers. Intimate atmosphere with a certain upscale feel to it. Most of the staff knew us by the end of our trip. Location was prime within two blocks of Metro. Surrounded by enough shops to keep my wife and daughters awe struck and enough Cafes, Brasseries (Les Deux Magots - 2 blocks) for me!

<Content>An oasis of tranquility, charm and service in the heart of the Rive Gauche. Last fall when I received a notice from Air France offering very inexpensive winter fares I booked a flight on Valentine鈥檚 Day to take my wife Paris for a short stay. Based upon the strong recommendation of a colleague from work and the Trip Advisor ratings (at that time Hotel de l鈥橝bbaye was ranked #10) I made a reservation for four nights. After being stuck on the ground at JFK Airport for nearly 7 hours due to an ice storm we arrived in Paris after spending 13 陆 hours in the plane. When we reached the hotel we knew we鈥檇 made a great choice. You walk through two large doors into the cobblestone courtyard and enter a series of charming common rooms 鈥?one with a working fireplace. At reception we were greeted warmly and whisked up to our room. As soon as we got there our frustration and disappointment of losing most of our first day in Paris melted away. As our tickets were so cheap, I splurged and booked one of their duplex suites. It was like we had our own private apartment on the Left Bank. There was a welcome note from the hotel鈥檚 manager and a basket of incredible fresh fruit. Paris rewarded us with early Spring weather 鈥?high 50鈥檚 and low 60鈥檚 and sunny. So we were able to use the balcony of our room every day to eat breakfast or lunch or have drinks. The Hotel de l鈥橝bbaye was exactly the type of hotel we鈥檝e been looking for in Paris. On prior trips we鈥檝e stayed on the Ile St. Louis and large 鈥渋nstitutional鈥?hotels on the Right Bank. L鈥橝bbaye is smaller and more intimate in a terrific location. It is close to several Metro stations and different lines as well as the shops and sights of St. Germain des Pres. At the same time at night it was extremely quiet 鈥?we used to live in NYC and we could not believe we were in the heart a major city. Because the weather was so warm the windows in the apartments across the street were open and we could hear their conversations. I can鈥檛 say enough for the service we received. I booked the room using the hotel鈥檚 website. The staff was very responsive and helpful. I also communicated with the staff regarding restaurant reservations. They were able to get us into each restaurant we requested. When a restaurant was booked for one day, they worked with me on alternative times that fit our schedule. They also suggested a local restaurant for dinner on Sunday night (when many restaurants in Paris are closed) and it turned out to be an excellent meal. Our room was spotlessly cleaned each day, and we enjoyed the complimentarily continental breakfast which is an additional charge at most Paris hotels. And the desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. I speak a bit of French and they indulged me by communicating in French. My wife doesn鈥檛 speak any French and they effortlessly switched between English and French when she was with me.The hotel was the perfect spot for us to start our walking tours of various parts of Paris. And a welcome home to return to. And we will return to the Hotel de l鈥橝bbaye again on our next trip to Paris.

<Content>Disappointing bed  I recently stayed at the L'Abbaye on an long (2 week) buisness trip to Paris. It's a pleasant, quiet, clean hotel, as one would naturally hope for an official four star (the above info is incorrect). Every other aspect of my stay was however frustrating; added up I was ultimately very disappointed in my stay.- My booked double bed (I'm very tall) turned out to be two singles pushed together, with single sheets. I asked for a proper large bed and was told there wasn't one available (and that two singles was the default in France?) but they could remake the bed with double sheets. I later taked to the manager and was moved to a (slightly inferior!) room with a decent bed. - When I rang to extend  confirm my booking (the hotel did not respond to emails to their published address) I specifically asked whether internet (essential for my work) was included in the price (the website is ambigious on this point). This was confirmed by the front desk. I found a paid wifi service on my arrival. I was then told there was free wired Internet but the wall jacks in both rooms in which I stayed were dummies (no connection pins). The manager gave me a very limited time wifi card in compensation; I ended up spending an extra 150 euros over my stay (I didn't bother trying to get this back as work paid, but still vexing).- The included breakfast is very limited; a hot drink, and small glass of juice, and some pastries/bread/jam. The quality is decent but no options, nothing savoury, no fruit, no refils. It's the worst hotel breakfast I've had at several hotels in Paris.

<Content>Spotless, Great Location and Charming We stayed for 5 days and I recommend this hotel highly. The rooms were small (as are most in Paris) but impeccably clean, great linens on the bed - small tub with spray nozzle - marble bathrooms, large french doors that opened to the courtyard with a fountain and birds each morning. We stayed in the back of the building. Also don't miss breakfast in the Garden room - coffee, juices and pastries. It was our honeymoon - we returned to the room one night to a bottle of champagne, crackers and some olives on a lovely tray with a personalized note. Great location - metro nearby and the most outrageous outdoor food market 2 blocks away with the best fresh food Paris has to offer - I had an orange and a pear that where the best I ever ate - we also got some fresh quiche, bread, cheese and a bottle of wine there.

<Content>Depends on where your room is... I had the pleasure of visiting Paris this past December. You cannot beat the location of this hotel. It is surrounded by shops, restaurants, and near a metro.Pros- Great location, nice friendly service, the room size was fine for a european room.cons-NOISE! we spent one night in a room that faced the main street. Trust me it wasn't bearable. I put in earplugs from the flight over, took half a sleeping pill and still couldnt sleep. I am not a complainer. If you are going to stay in this hotel I would pass on the cute street view and book a room in the back of the hotel. We asked to be moved and they were very nice. We had a new room one night later. I had read some reviews others wrote about the rooms getting super hot. Even in december when we would get back in the evening we would need to open the windows because it would get so hot. I would be a little apprehensive about staying here in the summer. Also...it rained every single day we there and it was pretty miserable. I wouldnt recomend going in Dec. We went because we had vacation time that had to be used.The restaurant- I would go atleast once because it is cute but IMO it's not worth 10 euros. The only hot food there are the eggs.Enjoy Paris! I cannot wait to go back!~!

<Content>I love de L'Abbaye- charming, warm, and great location I've been to Paris many times, and had had this hotel recommended to me more than once- didn't book it until a trip with a girlfriend to hang out in cafes, shop, and wear red lipstick. The rooms are small, true, but for the price in Paris perfectly fine. Nice marble-y bathrooms with everything you need.The public rooms are the real show here- no less because we arrived in a very rainy week. There is a lovely living room with a fireplace - bit of a contest to see who can snag the comfy armchairs closest to the fire and read all day- and a solarium where you take breakfast. There is also a small bar, which of course is almost empty and only really hotel guests, so, unlike many Paris hotels, you can spend quite a lot of time in your hotel but still have a drink or just be out of your room.The location is killer- smack in the middle of the 6th near all the best shopping and great cafes.

<Content>Charming Left Bank Find Thanks to TripAdvisor, we were lucky to find this charming gem in the heart of the left bank.Booked direct through the hotel and were given room 23. Yes, it was a bit small, but the bathroom was a nice size and never felt cramped (this is Europe after all, most hotel rooms aren't nearly as large as the US). FYI, tub/shower had no curtain. Just somehting to be aware of.This hotel is great for several things: romance, location, staff, value.If you want a truly romantic Paris experience for a decent price, stay here. It is hard to find a great hotel for 200-215 Euros, so I think this is a great deal for the money.Breakfast was served in the charming parlor room downstairs. Staff was extremely helpful and courteous.ALSO, this hotel was just bumped from a 3 star to a 4 star hotel, while we were there. Prices may go up, but we hope not!I would definately stay at this hotel again for my next trip to Paris.Bon voyage!

<Content>Standard doubles are tiny, dark, and nosy. Pleasant staff, pleasant public rooms, pleasant breakfast BUT if you stay here do not stay in a standard double room-- either stay in a superior room or suite or go to another hotel. The standard doubles are small (like a NYC maid's room), the double bed JUST fits, our room looked out on a small dark courtyard. The room was stuffy but the courtyard was noisy as it looked out on the kitchen and office. To upgrade was about $140/night.So, my recommendation is stay someplace else unless you can afford a higher level room. There is NOTHING more depressing on a vacation than having a tiny, dark, noisy room which is not that cheap.

<Content>small, but very nice The rooms are a bit small, but the hotel makes effective use of every inch of space with built in cabinets and such. The room felt like a luxury room on a cruise ship. We where traveling with a large suitcase and two large carry ons and were able to stow away everything so we could get around. I would recommend getting a twin room, even if traveling as a couple. They are put side to side like a king anyway. You could run the A/C even in October and you can control the thermostat. So A/C in the summer probably won鈥檛 be an issue.Some reviews complained about the noise level at the hotel. I didn鈥檛 notice any big issue and I am a very light sleeper. We had room 19 which was at the top of the staircase, with a window facing the front courtyard, directly over the reception and lobby area and below another room. Quite possibly the noisiest room in the hotel, and noise was not an issue. This is of course with the caveat that you are in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Paris and in a building that was built before noise ordinances were invented. You will hear occasional noise from the street and people in the hall. But the hotel is located in a very quite street of Paris and most of the hotels guests are the older type who just want to relax and go to bed after having dinner. The staff is friendly and courteous. Most speak English. They have free internet access 24/7. It gets quite busy in the morning. It鈥檚 only one computer. Breakfast is nice and free, but does get boring. The restaurant next door is very good. It serves French country food. The hotel is also located within two famous pastry stores. The very upscale Pierre Herm茅 and the more traditional Luduree (both on rue Bonaparte). Luduree has a caf茅. It was a very nice hotel.

<Content>Excellent but more than a little expensive GOOD NEWSVery close to St. Sulpice Metro and excellent restaurant (Cafe Cassette). No smell, even though not officially non-smoking. Quiet, clean, comfortable, flat-screen TV, magnificent bathroom (both tub and shower). Superb espresso (on the house while we waited, see below). Did not eat (expensive) breakfast there but opted instead for Cafe Cassette just down the street. Professional desk staff spoke adequate English and watched our baggage before check-in and after check-out.BAD NEWSCheck-in time was supposedly noon, but the room was not ready until 3 pm. We had an espresso on the house, then explored a bit, then had another espresso, and finally got into the room (professional staff took all luggage up the elevator within 3 minutes of our entry). Paid 244 EUR per night (4 nights), which really felt more than a little expensive. In the Parisian scheme of things, however, it was probably worth it.

<Content>Super hotel in a super location We spent 3 nights at this hotel in early June and couldn't have been happier with the hotel, helpful staff, rooms, breakfast, location and price. For what you get in its location, L'Abbaye is a real find. Very quite, with a courtyard off the street. Rooms are beautifully done and clean with up to date bathrooms. Some rooms do not have showers, however, so if that is important to you, mention it in your booking. You are just a couple of short blocks from the nearest metro station and maybe 3 short blocks from another line's metro station. It is very easy to get around Paris this way as the hotel is so central that most sights you would want to see are not that far away. Breakfast is in a wonderful sun room overlooking the garden. It is continental with the option to purchase an egg dish, which we didn't feel the need to do. Delicious pastries and croissants. We have stayed in other more expensive hotels in Paris, but this hotel is better in every respect. Can't wait to return to Paris and L'Abbaye.

<Content>Lovely relaxing hotel this hotel is wonderful - the terrace and public areas calming and relaxing, the rooms beautifully decorated and presented... it does feel like you are staying in a private house rather than a hotel. breakfast on the terrace (until 12!!) is so relaxing and most of the staff very helpful and friendly. St Germain is the best place to stay to explore the city; the local restaurants and shops are great. The hotel booked a restaurant for us one evening which was a great choice. thoroughly recommended.

<Content>Sweet Hotel We visited Paris in late July and found this cosy hotel a sanctuary in the bustle of Paris. The rooms are indeed small but well equipped and spotless. The staff were helpful and polite and the courtyard area a delight. Overall I found the hotel to be great value for money in an excellent location and look forward to visiting again.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Spend 3 nights at Hotel de l'Abbaye recently. It was an outstanding experience. The staff were all excellent, the room was quiet and the breakfast service on the patio was a treat. We liked the location, well away from the more extreme tourist areas closer to the river. Metro and good food nearby. Only negative was the influx of noisy American tourists to the common areas on the weekend but this was not the hotel's fault. We will certainly be back soon.

<Content>Great Choice in Paris My wife and I stayed here during our first trip to Paris. We made our selection based on the previous great reviews and we agree. This is a great choice for a hotel in Paris. It is within walking distance of all the major tourist sites. The room was clean, decorated nicely, and quiet. It is located on a side street with little traffic, but is within blocks of numerous restaurants in the Saint-Germain area. The staff was very helpful and courteous. They all spoke English, and helped us several times with directions and dinner reservations. Breakfast in the hotel's courtyard was a great way to start the day. While all the restaurants in the area that we tried were great, we thought the restaurant next door was the best meal we had in Paris.

<Content>Impeccable! I stayed here on my first trip to Paris and it was perfect. The location was completely central for sightseeing, and even for some (albeit mild) nightlife. The staff had mastered the art of customer service: they were helpful when we needed them and invisible when we didn't. The rooms were adorable and perfectly decorated and efficient. The hotel itself was gorgeous and the breakfast room was airy and beautiful. Basically, my experience was faultless. I cannot say enough good things.

<Content>Home away from home in a big city I found this little gem on tripadvisor a year ago when planning our dream French holiday. It was rated as number 10 then and during the year I paniced as , although there were no bad results it dropped down in the ratings. Well I think it is due to not a lot of travellers reporting back, so if you have visited, review this hotel to try and get it back to the rating it deserves.It is wonderful. and when you sit in the quaint courtyard for breakfast with the only noise being the fountain and the resident little birds , you cannot believe you are in a big city. The staff where incredibly helpful and their recommendation for dinner up the road was a highlight of incredible food that we ate along the way. The lamb in phyllo speciality is to die for and I am still dreaming of it........ The boulangerie down the road ( the one with the continuous line ) is the best

<Content>A peaceful retreat in busy Saint Germain We just returned from a 10-day trip to Paris, and we stayed at the L'Abbaye on the recommendation of a coworker. I stayed in a postage stamp sized room at a small boutique hotel in the Marais the last time I was in Paris, and I did not want to repeat this experience. Therefore, I booked a larger room at the L'Abbaye and we were not disappointed. The room was lovely and had more than adequate closet and drawer space. The safe in the closet was a plus, and the bathroom had all the amenities. The staff was helpful and professional, and they confirmed all our reservations for restaurants and transportation. The main streets and boulevards of Saint Germain are noisy and bustling, so the location of the L'Abbaye on a quiet side street was a plus. The hotel is near two metro stops - St. Sulplice and Rennes - that are on different lines, so you have access to different parts of Paris. It is also near the Gare Montparnasse, where we took the railroad to Chartres. We had two delightful dinners at Le Table de Perigord (on the corner) and the Cafe Cassette on the corner of Rue Cassette and Rennes is a great place for drinks, a light meal, or dessert. When (not if) we return to Paris, we will definately return to the L'Abbaye.

<Content>This hotel was ideal in every way... My husband and I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for 9 nights.The hotel staff are personable, helpful and go out of their way for the little things. This was a last minute trip for us (3 weeks preparation) and upon checking their website found out that they were booked the days we wanted, so we called them, and it turned out they had a suite-salon modern available which suited us. We wanted something larger than the standard sized room anyhow. The room was spotless, and the marble bathroom had a tub, separate shower and plenty of room for toiletries.The breakfast of croissants juice and delicious coffee is included, however, there is a menu, if you choose. My suggestion is the hotel could add fruit in addition to the breads.The location is perfect - 5 minute walk to St. Sulpice and the Metro.Plenty of shopping in all directions. We would certainly return to this hotel.

<Content>Paris Ideal After much planning for a trip with my mother on her 'milestone' birthday, an ample room was not available in this hotel, so I booked at a boutique closer to the Seine. When a room became available closer to our departure date, I did not hesitate to take it, room 317, a lovely duplex with one bedroom and very comfortable sitting room. It was a bit of a splurge but well worth the extra space and euros. The staff was extremely accommodating in making us comfortable, helping with restaurant recommendations and outstanding breakfast service. I could hardly believe we were in the heart of a city because of the melodious song birds in the garden area outside. It is ideally located near the Jardins du Luxembourg (an essential respite from the siteseeing scedule), Eglise Saint-Sulpice (don't miss the Delacroix murals as you walk in the front entrance), a delightful patisserie around the corner, and many restaurants to choose from in the area (and entertainment at L'Odeon).The hotel is beautifully appointed with comfortable sitting areas and gorgeous chintzes of a simple and elegant design. The clientele was chic and sophisticated, the shopping nearby was similar to Soho in New York, but with much more beautiful architecture and less commercialism. This will be my destination hotel on return visits, hands down.

<Content>Excellent location and service I stayed in a single large room with my wife and son. The hotel is extremely well located and within walking distance of many sites and restaurants. Our room was on the second floor (3rd floor American) and looked into an internal courtyard. Although the hotel is centrally located we had a very quiet room. No street noise at all. The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. I recommend the hotel and would stay there again. It is somewhat expensive.

<Content>Paris en Printemps! I stayed at Hotel de L'Abbaye with my 10 year old daughter in early April '06. Twenty years ago, I spent a college semester in Paris at the nearby Alliance Francaise. I've returned back a number of times and can't get enough of the 6th. This was a special trip with my daughter -- an introduction to the city I love so much and I wanted to make it very special. I'd stayed in a few hotels in the 6th on business, but was intrigued by the reviews I read on Trip Advisor. I researched hotels extensively and Hotel de L'Abbaye was simply the most logical choice. THe hotel is GREAT. The street is very quiet and residential, yet just a half block off the busy Rue de Rennes. It's 5 mins maxby foot to the St Sulpice Metro, 10 mins to St. Germain and about a 15 min walk to the Seine (but I walk fast). The cobblestone entry courtyard is charming. While the hotel is in an old building and has the exceptional charm of a well kept small Parisian hotel, I didn't see any antique elements like wooden beams or stone walls that I'd seen at other small hotels in the 6th. That was ok with me. It's very tidy and well appointed. We were on the third floor overlooking the courtyard. The room was small, but I knew that in advance. The bathroom comparatively was grand. The staff was quiet friendly and allowed me to speak French and spoke French back which was generous. THey were helfpul with restaurant recommendations and with other suggestions during our visit. There were a number of French in the hotel during our stay which was nice to see. THe other hotels I'd stayd at in the 6th were a bit noisy and Hotel de L'Abbaye was no exception. I could hear toilets flushing and other plumbing sounds, but thankfully no talking! It was not a major nuisance and that's part of the charm! THe Luxembourg Gardens -- my hangout in school -- is quite close and there are loads of great restaurants and shipping nearby (as well as one of the city's best patisseries on Rue Bonaparte -- can't remember the name! but it's just a half block N of Place St. Sulipice on the left.. Shopping is great too. I would highly recommend Hotel de L'Abbaye to anyone. It is delightful. Enjoy the magic of Paris!

<Content>You must stay here If you are even thinking of staying here, then you should. We stayed for a week in a one of the larger rooms on the first floor. It had a sitting area (very small sun room) with table and 2 chairs. From there you could exit to your own small terrace with a second table and chairs. We were traveling with our 16-year old son, so the room and space was perfect for us. The bathroom had plenty of amenities, which was nice. The soaking tub (inc. hand-held shower) was especially refreshing, after walking around all day. The breakfast was delicious. Fresh fruit was provided in our room.The staff was extremely nice and helped answer all of our numerous questions. The hotel is in a perfect location, close the metro, and within walking distance to everything!

<Content>Lovely hotel, lovely area! My wife  I stayed 3 nights in March. The Hotel de l'Abbaye turned out to be our favorite hotel durig our trip to France  the UK. The decor of the hotel is elegant but very comfortable. The public areas were very nice, and the breakfast atrium was lovely. The continental breakfast served there was very good and perfect for getting ready for a day of touring. The staff were very professional and genuinely friendly  helpful. Our room was ample, not huge but very comfortable, as was the bathroom which was very well stocked. There was plenty of space to unpack our things in both the bed room  bathroom. The hotel is located in a quiet area near the Luxembourg gardens  St. Sulpice, which made many sights, Musee d'Orsay, St.-Germain, the Latin Quarter, even Ile-de-la-Cite, only a leisurely walk away. To reach attractions further away, we took the Metro from nearby stations. The area doesn't have a jumping nightlife, but there were many excellent restaurants distributed in the nearby Luxembourg/Odeon area.

<Content>Very nice We stayed at this hotel from Nov 19-23. This is a great little boutique hotel. Very friendly staff. All speak English. Unlike most Paris hotels they include breakfast in the room cost. The breakfast is juice, coffee and pastries served by a wonderful hard working man in a nice glassed in garden room. The only negative on this hotel was our bed which was a double made up of 2 very short singles pushed together and made up individually. So it was like being in seperate beds. Seemed a little strange. The rooms are teeny but most are in Paris. The bathroom adequate. Every thing spotless. And very important: it is totally quiet. We would defintely stay here again.

<Content>L'Abbaye in November We stayed at L'Abbaye for 7 nights in Mid-November, 2005. We really liked it's quiet location near Luxembourg Gardens in the 6eme. The entrance and the public rooms are charming. The staff is among the friendliest that we have ever dealt with in Paris.The standard room @ 199E is miniscule, and the carpet in our room, number 20, was badly stained along the foot of the beds (as it turns out, the only place you can really walk inside the room.) The bathroom was adequate and kept meticulously clean.The daily petit dejeuner that comes included with the price of the room became a bit boring and repetitive after a few days, although the room/s in which it is served are lovely. The breakfast consisted of coffee/tea, orange juice and a small basket of bread (baguette, croissant, sweet roll). The addition of fruit and/or yogurt would be a real plus.Although we enjoyed our stay, we will probably look elsewhere when we return next year, possibly an apartment.

Tasty continental breakfast with strong coffee. very good value at 199 euros inclusive of taxes and breakfast. We would definitely stay here again. With regards to the language, we had no problems if you tried a to speak a little french. everyone appreciated that we tried. Internet access: the hotel is wifi. the fee is 25 euros for 24 hours of use. also, there is a computer on the first floor which does not have a fee.

<Content>Lovely hotel -- if only the standard rooms weren't so small I have only one less-than-positive thing to say about the Hotel de l鈥橝bbaye, which is that the standard rooms are, as other reviewers have mentioned, very small. I stayed by myself in a standard double (Room 31), and, while it was adequate as a single, I wouldn鈥檛 have wanted to stay there with another person. On the plus side, the room was quiet and dark at night, the bed was comfortable, there was ample light for reading in bed (which was a good thing, since there was really nowhere else in the room to sit and read), and the bathroom was spotlessly clean, modern, and a decent size.Apart from the room size, I loved everything about the l鈥橝bbaye. The public areas are beautiful. Even though it was too cold when I was there to eat breakfast in the garden, the glassed-in breakfast area that looks out on the garden is lovely (and several copies of the International Herald Tribune are provided every morning, so I was always able to snag a copy, no matter how many other American guests were eating breakfast at the same time). The wood-burning fire in the lobby looked so welcoming when I came back to the hotel late one afternoon, chilled after a long day of sightseeing in the Parisian drizzle, that I brought my travel journal down to the lobby and wrote up my notes on the day while sitting in front of the fireplace.I found the staff at the l鈥橝bbaye to be uniformly helpful and fluent in English. When I arrived, at 11 a.m., my room wasn鈥檛 ready yet, so the desk clerk suggested that I wait in the breakfast room (where breakfast was still being served to late risers) and order breakfast if I wanted to, which I gratefully did. (Breakfast was included in my room rate and, even though breakfast on the day of arrival was, in effect, a bonus breakfast, no extra charge was made.) And when I asked another desk clerk to find a street address for me one day (having misplaced the address of a store I wanted to visit), he not only found it immediately but printed out an internet map of the neighborhood for me.Bottom line: if your budget runs to one of the larger rooms at the Hotel de l鈥橝bbaye, don鈥檛 hesitate to book a room there. If you can only swing one of the standard rooms, then whether the hotel is a good fit for you depends on how important the size of the room is to you, and whether you鈥檙e willing to put up with tight quarters in exchange for all the other good qualities I鈥檝e mentioned.

<Content>gem boutique hotel What a great little gem of a find in the Latin Quarter so close to the St. Sulpice metro stop, in the midst of all the shops and cafes. On a quiet street in the hustle bustle of town. The hotel is set back off the street with a little courtyard. The staff is very friendly and helpful. All speak English. They will recommend restaurants, confirm reservations, everything. There is internet access, they say .15E/minute, but nobody charged me at all. The price is great 199E, European breakfast included, which is enough given the lunch and dinner you're going to eat. The rooms are small, unless you book a larger room or suite, but adequate. The beds are short in the standard room. So if you are tall, book a more expensive room, it will be worth it. The bathroom is nice, blowdryer included. What a great place. We highly recommend it. THis was our 3rd time to Paris, perfect.

<Content>Never again We had booked our room in August, specifying we wanted a superior room as high up as possible. The hotel replied they would do their best to grant our wish. On arrival we were offered a room on the ground floor some distance from the reception desk and next to a lavatory, with a french window going out unto a narrow inside court. The room was dark even in mid-afternoon. When we complained it was pointed out to us with silky smoothness that they had only promised us a room. As rooms were allocated on a daily basis and this was the only one available of that category they were entirely justified and we were utterly wrong in complaining. As an alternative we were offered a standard (i.e. small) room and a suite at a 10 per cent discount. We left next morning.

<Content>A Tremendous Value In Paris My family booked four rooms for a Paris visit for my Mom's 75th birthday. As all family members had been to Paris previously and all had specific accommodation requests, my task to choose the hotel was a potential mine field, partcularly if you knew my family!After spending hours on the selection task I chose this hotel and it turned out wonderfully. All family members loved the place and would stay nowhere else in the future. The location is on a very quiet side street yet close to all that Paris offers. We were able to walk everywhere from this location. The rooms were quite nice and the lobby area is beautiful and provided a tranquil oasis for an early evening cocktail. It is geogously decorated and filled with spectacular floral arrangements and orchids. The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful and were totally proficient in English.Best of all however is what a bargain this is in high priced Paris. Our room rate was just 199 Euro per night including continental breakfast and taxes. Breakfast is served in a beautiful solarium with an outdoor garden and is very adequate but not the best I have had. It consisted of coffee, fresh orange juise and a basket of breakfast breads.All in all I can't imagine a better value in Paris.

The location is wonderful-on the Left Bank and surrounded by beautiful boutiques. You can walk anywhere in Paris from this hotel and we did. Although the standard room is small for a long stay, it is perfect for just a few nights and there are larger rooms available. The lobby is quite lovely and the breakfast area is charming. The staff is polite, and, although not warm, they are always helpful. When we reurn to Paris, which we certainly will, we will be happy to stay at Hotel de lAbbaye again.

<Content>Displeased with staff This hotel has been so well-regarded over the years that I found it very disappointing that the staff ignored my emails. I made a reservation months in advance and had to cancel it due to my traveling companion's change in travel plans. I sent the hotel one email on Sept. 3rd explaining the situation and that I would like a cancellation confirmation. Usually someone replies to emails within 24 to 48 hours. Two days passed and I received no reply. I then sent numerous emails during the week of Sept. 6th from my various email addresses both at home and at work. The emails I sent at work gave me notification that someone at the hotel read them. Yet I never got any acknowledgement from the hotel during this time.Finally I decided that I will fax the hotel and inform them that I will not be responsible if they charge my credit card the first night's deposit (as a no-show) as I have tried many times to get a cancellation from them. If that didn't work I was going to call them. Amazingly the hotel sent on Sept. 10th emails to all of my email addresses claiming they had emailed me several times during the week with my cancellation confirmation. In their email there was a cancellation confirmation (it was not an attachment) dated Sept. 4th. I don't believe the hotel ever sent me any cancellation confirmation emails during the week as they claim. For one thing it's peculiar that I received their emails dated Sept. 10th and nothing else before that so I know it's not that my server rejected their emails. Also no one at the hotel bothered to acknowledge that they read the emails I sent from my work address.In short, I am sure many people will disagree with me as the hotel has a good reputation, but I find the staff did not act professionally in my situation.

<Content>Wonderful all around My family spent five days at l'Abbaye. We had two rooms, both of which were extremely pretty. Although they were on the smaller side, we didn't care because (1) we were in Paris and (2) the rooms were well designed to maximize space, with full-length closets directly beside the bed and a small flat-screen TV tucked above the desk. The bathroom was modern and a good size.The common areas were equally charming, especially the breakfast room, and the staff friendly and attentive.The breakfast was delicious and a fantastic way to start the day.I would definitely stay here again and again.

<Content>What a great place to stay! We just returned from a weekend stay at Hotel de l'Abbaye (July 15th and 16th) - it was wonderful! We decided on this hotel based on reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not dissappointed. The hotel is in the 6th district and was within walking distance to several landmarks, including Notre Dame, the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower (this was a long walk but we did it!).The hotel itself is located off a side street, so it was very quiet. It is not big hotel, which we loved, but is elegantly decorated with a very welcoming appeal. We stayed in room #3 - it is on the first floor next to the lobby. We thought we would hear noise from the lobby, but we didn't. Our room opened up into the lovely garden and waterfall. The bathroom was very modern, with a large tub and separate shower. What impressed us the most was how much thought and effort the hotel staff made to improve the quality of our stay. We had never been to Paris before, and didn't speak much French, but the staff made us feel very welcome and appreciated. They made wonderful suggestions for dinner, and also made reservations for us. When we used room service, it was always very prompt and our waiters were always very kind and considerate. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We will definitely return to Hotel de l'Abbaye the next time we visit Paris.

<Content>This Hotel is Wonderful I stayed in this hotel in late May and it was a delight. The staff are friendly and immediately responsive. The rooms aren't large, but they are beautifully done with great linens and a flat-screen TV. The bathrooms have large (by European standards) marble bathtubs. My room was cleaned almost the moment I left it everyday. The location is superb for shopping or for visiting museums. The air conditioning works which is unusual for small Parisian hotels. The continental breakfast (which is included in the room rate) usually offers perfect croissants and baked breads. You will need to bring an adaptor if you use computers or hairdryers requiring US electrical current. I really can't say enough about this great find in Paris. On the other hand, I hope you don't pay attention to a word I've said here because by all rights Hotel de l'Abbaye should be sold out year round and I probably won't be able to get a reservation at this wonderful hotel next year!

It's a beautifully run hotel, with staff who are courteous, kind and considerate. The rooms may not be huge, but they are very clean and well kept. Perfect location in that you're close to the Metro and bustle of St Germain, but tucked away in a quiet side street.

Our room was small, (and the bed was just a double), but it was beautifully decorated, had a flat screen TV, a beautiful marble bathroom and was so quiet we overslept one day until 1 pm! The staff were unfailingly helpful and friendly and the breakfast, which was included in our price of 200 euros, inlcuded fresh juice, a basket of delicious breads with butter and jam, and coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Breakfast is served in a beautiful room overlooking the hotel's courtyard and in the summer breakfast is served outside. Unfortunately the weather was too cool or rainy while we were there, but we loved looking out onto the small fountain while reading the Herald Tribune and nibbling on stellar croissants. We looked at a larger room which was even more impressive than ours. If you like a little more sleeping space than a double offers, then we would recommend booking one of these larger rooms. The hotel is located close to everything. We walked to Notre Dame, Musee d'Orsay, the Louvre, Place de la Concorde and Musee Rodin without any difficulty. You couldn't ask for a better location.

<Content>We would stay here again! Was just in Paris last week and tried another hotel on Left Bank (Hotel de l'Academie) and I was just SO disappointed that I wish I had booked at Hotel de l'Abbaye again. My husband and I were here last summer and it was the perfect, quaint and charming get-away in the city. Excellent location. On a quiet street with a gorgeous front courtyard and equally delightful backyard garden where breakfast is served. This is a place where you can hang out and relax! Although the room was small (expected), it was clean, nicely decorated, with modern fixtures. Only complaint was that it was difficult to bathe in small tub and the bed mattresses need to be replaced (uncomfortable). Yet, overall, we were very happy with our stay and its friendly staff and we would go back again!

<Content>A Perfect Small Hotel After a lot of research my husband and I finally settled on the Hotel de L'Abbaye for our first (and hopefully not last) stay in Paris. It's got a great location in the St. Germain-de-Pres district - you can walk to just about everything. I simply can't say enough good things about this hotel. It was beautifully decorated, from the stunning floral arrangement in the lobby to the peaceful courtyard where breakfast (excellent croissants, baguettes, coffee) was served. The rooms must be soundproofed because I never heard a single sound from other guests for our entire four night stay - not a voice or a door or a footstep. Our room was decorated in modern style (some are traditional). It was very spacious and overlooked the interior courtyard, so there was no street noise, but I doubt any of the rooms get much of that because it is on a very tiny, quiet street. There was a small sitting area (with a basket of fruit on our arrival), and a flatscreen tv. The bathroom was spotless, entirely marble, with a bath, a separate shower stall and toilet stall, plenty of thick towels and great robes. The bed linens were incredibly soft and smooth. The staff was very friendly, spoke English, and they were great with restaurant suggestions and reservations.You really have to see this place to believe it. It was actually better than the descriptions. It's expensive, but not outrageous, and certainly worth every penny.

<Content>Nicest staff Stayed at Hotel de l'Abbaye last summer; the staff is excellent! The air conditioning in our room wasn't the best (typical I think of European hotels) and the staff was prompt to address the issue. We moved to a suite for same price as standard room. Hotel is lovely with quaint, comfortable courtyard and great complimentary couissant, juice  coffee for breakfast. Price was a little high with the currency difference, but made up for that with nice neighborhood and good access to metro.  After our stay in Paris, we went to Italy for a week and returned to Paris for one day to catch the Eurostar to London. We had planned to leave our luggage at the train station but found it cost 60 Euros for one small bag. We had 7 bags! We had a whole day ahead of us but couldn't leave our luggage. I called Hotel de l'Abbaye and asked could we leave our things at the hotel for the day and they were quick to accomodate us! We were able to enjoy another wonderful day in Paris thanks to the hotel's exceptional staff! Oh, and the best part was the fruit basket waiting for us upon arrival. The best peach I've ever had!

<Content>Good, clean Stayed 6 nights last week.....great location, clean. Of course, small room and bathroom (room #18) . The shower is sooo tiny! Grabbed pastry from a bakery one block away and coffee every AM and was cheaper than eating breakfast there. Train station is right there too. Not the Ritz, but neither is the price! Bernard was very helpful too.

<Content>The best of Paris We just returned from a 6 night stay at this cozy, friendly beautiful place. The staff went out of their way to be helpful and polite and the location is within walking distance of evrything you want to see. The front desk even booked our day trip to versailles. The room was small but nicely furnished (down to the heated towels) and for the price I dont imagine there is anywhere close to being as wonderful as Hotel De l'abbey. Its gets an A+++++++++++++ in my book.

<Content>wonderfull getaway My wife and I just returned from Paris and stayed at the Hotel de l'Abbaye. It could not have been a better location nor more perfect environment. Prior to our trip I had searched for months and had considered larger and more famous hotels but the reviews on tripadvisor were right on the money. The tranquility and the professional and courteous service I believe are the best points of this hotel. We requested rooms overlooking the courtyard were a plus but it really is on a small and quiet street. The Perigord restaurant is next door and it was a lovely small restaurant. This place was just right for those looking for a quiet haven in a large city.

<Content>Noisy Hotel I just got back from Paris and stayed at this hotel. There were 4 of us and we had two rooms. One of the rooms was a garden room which was absolutely beautiful. The other was just average. The rooms were very noisy and when mentioned to the staff they could have cared less. When I asked for assistance to confirm my airport car service the person working the desk in the evening, was put out by my request. He complained that they may not be there and you should do these things during the day. (It was a 24/7 operation we were calling). He also commented that I should wear shoes in the lobby because my slippers could be offensive to the other guests. It was 10 at night and my blistered tired feet could not stay in my shoes any longer and if it is not bothering me, why should it bother him. At breakfast our last day, we asked if we could sit in front of the fireplace to have breakfast as the dining room was quite crowded. We were told no because you don't eat breakfast in front of the fireplace. Interesting in that it is part of the bar area in the evening where food and drinks are served. This hotel needs to train their staff on the basics of customer service. Wouldn't rush back here.

<Content>Perfect for first time in Paris I stayed at L'Abbaye in February 2004. I was visiting a friend who lived nearby. She had recommended Relais St. Suplice, however, they were booked so I searched the internet and found the delightful website for L'Abbaye. First, L'Abbaye is truly a unique hotel and for someone who is visiting Paris for the first time, I would highly recommend it for its ambiance. It's wonderful arriving at their courtyard and feeling like you're entering an old and charming monastery in the heart of the Left Bank. That said, I paid a steep sum, 250 euro, for a room that was very small. It had a nice view to the front courtyard, but the twin beds were tiny. I almost felt as if I was Alice in Wonderland and had gone through a door into a doll's house! The bathroom was a nice size, modern and fully equipped. There was also a flat screen desktop T.V. Breakfast downstairs in the conservatory was lovely and the staff was extremely helpful. The location is great, however, I prefer to be on the other side of St. Germain, closer to the Seine. It's just a matter of preference. The shops all around are lovely and there are dozens of wonderful restaurants and cafes to choose from.

<Content>Very nice! The hotel was very charming, good size room and great staff and service. A lot of American couples and families. No shower but a tub with a hand held shower spray. WIthin walking distance to the Lovre. Air conditioning, ahhhhh! Breakfast was only a basket of breads and coffee however for extra you could order eggs. Internet for a fee avavilable in the lobby, kids IM-ing on it quite a bit though. Would reccomend and also would stay there again. The excerisions they recommend through paris vision was also very nice, expensive but I think worth it!

<Content>A great small hotel in Paris, at last! My girlfriend and I visited Paris on May Day weekend in 2004. I had made reservations at the Hotel de L'Abbaye on the strength of both Time Out and Tripadvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. Given hotel prices in Western Europe as a whole are on the steep side, I didn't think the hotel was overpriced. The double room was small-ish but overlooked the courtyard and had a very good sized en suite bathroom. Breakfast was included and service was excellent throughout our stay. It was fantastic to find a hotel in Paris with such pleasant staff and in such a good location. Just be prepared for all the Americans who too have caught on to this lovely hotel!

<Content>Perfect Tranquil Hotel My mother and I recently returned from our 7 day trip to Paris vowing to stay in no other Parisien Hotel -again! We found the location perfect, an idyll of peace with a beautiful little courtyard for breakfast and evening relaxation. The hotel ambience, decor and level of service were superb. Saint Sulpice Metro 3mins away and a 5/10 minute walk to Boulevard St Germain. We had 2 excellent meals at La Table du Perigord, just a stones throw from the Hotel. The area is quiet, refined and safe and the Luxembourg Gardens a 10 min walk away.

<Content>Heaven in l'Abbaye A few months ago, my family and I took our first trip to Paris. We were extremely uptight about finding the perfect hotel... it had to be in a quiet location, yet in the middle of everything; it had to be small, but with all of the necessary ameneties. Yes, we sound as if we were picky, but seeing as my parents were responsible for my sister and I (we're tough critics), it made sense. We ended up making reservations with the Hotel de l'Abbaye, a quaint establishment on the quiet street of Rue Cassette, and we couldn't have been happier. The rooms, large by European standards, were quintessential Paris. While not all rooms are decroated equally in this hotel, we received rooms that were adorned in a country French theme that managed to be both homey and stylish. The service was unparalleled- we were given wonderful (and complementary!) breakfasts of French croissants and chocolat chaud (hot chocolate), and the men and women at the front desk were always willing to help us plan tours or give us directions. We didn't once feel like stupid Americans, as the stereotype has become, and it was always wonderful to receive a cheerful welcome when we returned to the hotel each evening. I'm sure we won't fail to return to the Hotel de l'Abbaye on our next visit to Paris, for this hotel did not only offer us a place to stay, but memories that will last a lifetime.

<Content>l'Abbaye is great, but a tad overpriced The Hotel de l'Abbaye is a very nice, slightly modern hotel, well located in the Latin Quarter. Very quite, with nice ammenities. As is common in Europe (but not without exception), a double bed is really two twins pushed together. Great bath and shower and good closet space. Well functioning airconditioner. My only, relatively minor issues were:1. Lack of information at check-in. The hotel offers complimentary internet service, but we only found out by accident on our last day. We were also told by one employee that the hours of it are 8am to 8pm, but that same day, in trying to use it, found it closed at 7:15pm. 2. Huge room key that must be left at the counter when leaving. If returning late at night (after midnight), it required waiting for the night person to wake up and buzz you in.Aside from those, I would say the l'Abbaye is great, but a tad overpriced as I expended my stay in Paris at the Hotel Luxembourg (nearby), and found an equally great hotel for about 60 euros/night less.

<Content>Perfect! We stayed here from May 17-22 and we absolutely loved it! Everything about this hotel is charming; from the courtyard where they provide coffee and croissants at breakfast, to the rooms which are small but filled with character and immaculately clean. There is also a flat screen TV in each room. The staff was wonderful, and couldn't be nicer. The location is also great. You don't feel like just a tourist staying at a big hotel chain, like you may if you stayed on the right bank. There is great shopping nearby, and wonderful cafes that have been there for ages where great writers and famous thinkers spent their time. Stay at Hotel de l'Abbaye and you will keep coming back!

<Content>Simply wonderful Like other reviewers, my partner and I chose the Abbaye after a lot of Internet searching. It was well worth the search! The location is perfect... about two blocks from a Metro stop, lots of cafes, shopping, and upscale dining within easy walking distance -- yet tucked away on a quiet side street. We splurged on a duplex suite --meaning that we had a two-story little apartment. It was beautifully appointed and we had a nice patio/balcony overlooking the front courtyard. Lots of thoughtful touches -- a flat-screen TV, a big bathroom on the first floor, but also a small WC on the second floor, armoires with lights that went on when you opened the door, etc. We loved the room so much that (shame on us!) we even spent basically an entire day picknicking in the room and catching up on our reading. Try doing that in the typical Paris shoebox hotel room.The only caveat I would have is that this is a three-, not four-, star hotel. The front desk staff are nice but there is no concierge. The room-service menu is very basic (soups and croque-monsieurs, but nothing fancier). The beds (two twins pushed together, not a king like we had expected) are a little on the small side. The staff were not able to satisfy a couple of our more demanding service requests (help getting a shirt ironed, for instance). However, to get four-star service, we would have to spend as much (or more) as we did for our two-story room, and we would have had a much smaller hotel room and been in a much less interesting neighborhood. For us, it was well worth the trade-off, and we would definitely go back.

<Content>Americans Galore We spent five days this April in Paris at the Hotel de L'Abbaye. The service was wonderful. our room was small but looked out over the courtyard and we fell asleep each evening to the sound of the fountain there. We did have a few disappointments: The breakfast served was the same every morning without a variation. After a few days we paid extra and went out to a local cafe. The hotel was completely full and everyone was American. This made us feel as if we were in the States rather than in France. This would be a plus to some but for those looking for a true French experience, it was a letdown.Think we will try somewhere else on our next trip in September.

<Content>The best Paris can offer I chose this hotel after months of internet searching. Various reviews specifically on Trip advisor decided that this was the hotel for our Honeymoon. The hotel is on the Left bank of the city, in a very quiet location - but still only a 30 seconds walk from Rue St Germain and its fantastic shops  cafes. The hotel is beautifully decorated, with lovely flowers everywhere. The decor  atmosphere are both peaceful, as are the lovely gardens  adjoing dining area (I undertstand the hotel was formally an abbey). Our room although somewhat small (a standard room) but fine, well decorated, very clean - with an excellent bathroom. The hotel staff could not be more friendly, specifically helpfull in locating good restaurants etc. With both metro stations  bus stops really near - it meant the numerous sites on the west bank, and on the other side of the river were quickly  very easily accesible. We will use this hotel again, maybe to celebrate our first anniversary. Choose this hotel, not a faceless large chain. Enjoy.
