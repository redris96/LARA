<Content>Candour re the Courtyard I stayed at the Courtyard with my 2 daughters for 3 nights from 30th Nov. to 2 Dec. As other reviewers stated the location is its best assett and deserves 10 out of 10 for this. We were travelling from Ireland and were tired and cold on arrival and were left feeling even colder after check in. The young hostess was rude and unfriendly and, apart from asking for my credit card details and telling us our room number she spoke not a word, no welcome , no how are ye, no explanation of hotel facilities etc. This is so alien from other welcomes we have received in the United States I can only assume she was a stand in, we never saw her again and all other hotel staff were warm and friendly.Our room was big and comfortable but the toilet got blocked after a few uses. However it was fixed on request. We had a late flight on the day of departure and were allowed to hold on to the room until 2 o'clock at no extra cost.All in all we had a comfortable stay at the Marriott, quiet and efficient. More privacy might be afforded to guests when accessing their safety deposit boxes, however. It's a pity our first impression was so negative!Noeleen C.Kildare,Ireland.

<Content>Great Location Like many of the previous reviews, the hotel has a great location for tourists. A 2 minute walk and you are on Newbury Street which is a great area of Back Bay. Then a few more minutes and you are at the Public Garden and Boston Common. We loved the shower- big shower- no tub. The room was fine. The one draw back was the staff using the ice machine outside our room at 6am for 10 minutes, not allowing us to sleep in. Overall- it was a nice stay but a great location.

<Content>Ideal location Standard hotel accommodation with easy walking access to the touristy things we wanted to do during our two night stay. We breakfasted in the hotel, the all in menu was better value than picking individual items from the menu.

<Content>a potential problem for staying this hotel Here is the problem. Our regulations require the folio (to get the reimbursement) but the hotel won't supply one if the reservation was made by a third party organizer and the third party organizers don't have the data to provide a folio. The hotel itself is great but they are not willing to solve the problems like the one I had.

<Content>Great hotel Spent two nights in Boston at the Courtyard and loved it.Hotel is in a magic location, walking distance to seemingly everything we wanted to do in Boston. We had a 2 queen room which seemed very large, with a huge flat screen tv on the wall.The bathroom was nice, with a shower that had two shower heads, but only one would operate at a time(?!)Interestingly, there was a little laundry room next to the ice machine on the 2nd floor! A coin operated washing machine and dryer, with a big box of detergent! Very unusual, and handy too.The desk staff were superb, and we would stay here again anytime.

<Content>Excellent Hotel and Location We booked a suite here for seven nights at the end of July and would recommend it to any fellow Boston visitors. The room was spacious with a seperate living area which was ideal for relaxing in and watching TV in the mornings. We had breakfast in the hotel most dayss and though not a massive menu, it was all cooked and served to a high standard, and the buffet was good value at $15.The hotel is in an ideal location in the Back Bay area. Situated one block away from Copley Square, the Prudential centre, Boylston Street and near two 'T' stations it is easy to get around Boston. Also a 15 minute walk from Fenway Park, which is a must to watch a game or for the stadium tour.We would certainly stay at this hotel on our next Boston visit

<Content>Highly recommended Great choice for all of central Boston and Back Bay. Very smooth check in with pleasant staff and a great buffet breakfast. The rooms are great. Large enough for two adults and two teens. Shower a little counter intuitive for Europeans but hardly a big issue.Location as has been pointed out is superb with short walks to Boylston and Newbury St shopping. Easy stroll to Boston Common and if you want even through to Cambridgeshire Mall and Fanueil Hall. Subway is close if you prefer although stations being rebuilt this year and public AC not very effective/non existent. Would like to return. Costs very very reasonable for centre of a US city and much better than anything in NYC.

<Content>We love this hotel! We stayed for 7 days and would stay there again. The location was great -- right in the middle of Copley Square, across from a grocery store and down the street from all the shops and restaurants, and right around the corner from the T. The staff was warm, friendly, helpful and accommodating. The room contained a small fridge. The rooms were clean, clean. The beds great, with nice linens. The hotel lobby almost felt like you were in a small European hotel, where you could go sit on a couch and have a coffee or tea (complimentary), watch tv, or use the computer. My daughter, who can't sleep, was perfectly fine, comfortable and safe going down late at night to make a cup of tea or surf the internet.

<Content>Amazing Location We went to Boston for a 3 night stay with our 2 year old son. The hotel was in an amazing location and we could walk pretty much everywhere. It was close to shopping and dining experiences. The hotel itself was extremely clean and well kept and the staff was very friendly. The only drawback was that the size of the room was small for a king size bed and a pack and play, where my son slept. The bathroom was spacious and very clean, and the housekeeping was done in a very timely fashion. We would definately recommend this hotel for a great stay in Boston!

<Content>Great hotel! We had a great stay at Courtyard Boston Copley Square! The hotel staff was warm and inviting upon check in. Our seventh floor corner room had a king bed and a decent sized bathroom with a great shower! The location was close to everything including Boston Common and the Freedom Trail. Beacon Hill and Fenway Park were a short walk away along with the shops and restaurants of Newbury Street . The hotel is only two blocks from a T station which makes getting around easier if your feet are tired. We would definitely stay here again while visiting Boston!

<Content>Difficult Check In We booked two rooms at this hotel based on the good Trip Advisor reviews available at the time. The hotel is fine -- clean and convenient -- but nothing to get excited about. It took the staff about 30 minutes to check us in because 1)They said they had computer problems (but they checked someone else in ahead of us) 2) The lady who was helping us did not have full command of the English language and was trying to give someone on the phone directions without success 3) They just did not care very much. They also gave us a bad key and asked to reswipe my Amex 3 separate times, including after we we put our luggage in the room and came back downstairs. We were given two breakfast coupons for each room, even though we were paying for 3 people per room (which totalled $261 per room). Even after our unecessarily difficult check in experience we were advised that each additional person would have to pay $14.95 for breakfast -- which turned out to consist of the usual free type of continental breakfast you see everywhere. I made coffee in my room, ate a granola bar, and gave my kids the breakfast coupons. The other room got charged the additional $14.95 so they were not kidding. I will say the valet was great, and helped us get a very nice car and driver for our trip to the airport. Regardless, I would not stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Courtyard Copley Square!!! We LOVED this Courtyard. The location could not have been better. This was our first trip to Boston, we wanted to be in the middle of everything and this hotel is. Walking distance to almost everything. The staff was courteous and accomodating. Our room was spacious and comfortable- the bathroom was a good size and there was plenty of water pressure in the shower:) Exceded our expectations in every way. Definately worth every penny.

<Content>Quiet Sanctuary, but Service Needs Work This is an older building, but the rooms and bathrooms are a decent size, at least for one. Two people might get a little claustrophobic, especially if one is my girlfriend. The hotel is centrally located and easily accessible by T (Copley Station). Lots of places to eat nearby. I had a nice quiet room with bay windows, a king size bed, and a large bathroom - Room 605. Itfelt like a nice quiet sanctuary after a long day's travel or work.Front desk clerk was very friendly and accommodating, allowing me to check in at 11:00 a.m. on my first day. Unfortunately, that was partially offset on the last day by a failure to cancel my wake up call as requested - a pet peeve. Housekeeping repeatedly screwed up (didn't put away the ironing board, left water in the coffee maker from previous tenant, didn't replenish the packs of coffee, failed to clean the coffee maker - they must have something against caffeine).Finally I never could figure out how to set the thermostat - there seemed to be only two settings - on (or Arctic), and off. I left it off and was comfortable in early June.I will probably stay here again when business takes me to Copley Place. I prefer staying here to the hotels which are physically located in the mall - this Courtyard seems quieter and less hectic.Bottom line is the facilities are fine, but the service needswork.

<Content>Clean, convenient, nice staff but nothing exceptional Stayed here for 3 nights on business at the end of March/beginning of April. The first night I was in a room next to the stairs that was so small the tv was on the side of the bed (ie I had to lay in bed and turn my head to the side to watch it). Room window looked onto a brick wall, no fridge, the temperature control was broken and I heard the two heavy stairwell doors slamming all night. Beware the room next to the stairs! Staff was very accomodating the next day and switched me to another room immediately. Most staff was very nice and friendly, remembered me. My second room was much larger, window looked onto actual view, had a fridge, working temp control, etc. Much nicer. The hotel was very clean, pleasant enough though pretty generic mid-tier chain hotel. Thought the breakfast buffet was included but it costs $15. A little pricey. Go to Au Bon Pain or one of the myriad of other places near by instead if you want to eat quickly and more cost effectively. Free hi-speed internet access in the room (but not wi-fi) was nice to have. Overall, perfectly fine but nothing to write home about.

<Content>Great Time in Boston My boyfriend and I just returned from our weekend stay (Dec. 28th - 30th) in Boston and had a great time!Hotel InfoThe hotel staff was great and we had a room on the 6th floor in the corner that was nice and spacious. It also had a fridge and free internet access which was perfect for us. Very convenient location, which was close to T train station and restaurants (some were expensive). We also like to go dancing so we suggest checking out Saints right down the block from the hotel. Additionally, with the fridge we went to grocery store (Shaws)across the street to get juice and snacks.The breakfast is a bit expensive ranging from $10 to $15 so we preferred to eat cereal in our room (hoping to save some money) or get something in the area.The workout room (not a gym) is a bit small but my boyfriend was able to get a workout. It just can't hold more than 2 or 3 people.Where to eat?We love to eat and had a lovely lunch at Osushi (some of the BEST sushi I have ever had). I would suggest going to Chinatown (you can also get cheaper souveniers at a Washington St store on the way to Chinatown) or Chilli Duck for malaysian or Thai food. Also you can get good seafood near Quincy Market while visiting the freedom trail.All in all, I found Boston very similar to New York and look forward to visiting again.

<Content>Great place to stay This is a wonderful place to stay. It is located on Exeter Street in Back Bay which is within an easy walking distance of the Prudential Center and Copley Place; the T (subway) station, the Back Bay train station; Newbury Street shopping; and too many restaurants  lounges to mention. It definately has the cozy feel of a boutique hotel. The front desk staff should be commended for the service they provide to their guests. They are extremely friendly and helpful. Housekeeping does a terrific job -- our lovely room was spotless. The breakfast restaurant is bright, cheerful and the buffet is yummy. Service was excellent. We booked through the AAA website and received an very reasonable rate. You will love this hotel !

<Content>cute little "boutique" style hotel stayed here for 3 nights in Nov/07. THE GOOD: interesting little (100 rooms or so) hotel with a boutique feel. nice quirky rooms, all are different, as this was originally an apt. building (built about 100 years ago). Windows are large and they open. Get a room higher up if noise bothers you as this is right downtown. Great location very close walk to the subway and lots of restaurants and upscale shops. Compared to other hotels nearby (the Lenox, etc), your money goes a little further here. Staff seems genuinely pleasant, not just going through the routines. Rooms were done in 2004 but are holding up well. Bathroom was large with lots of clean towels, granite counters, strong water pressure in the shower and toiletries of a quality that you would expect from a mid-scale chain. free use of internet in the lobby and free cookies/fruit in the afternoon at the front desk.Breakfast buffet has sufficient choices and the kitchen and service staff did a great job of keeping everyone happy. Even the cook came out to see if we needed anything.THE BAD: a few too many stray hairs on the bathroom floor (which always drives me crazy). An extra blanket in the closet would have been nice, as our room was cold, especially when you sat next to the window. it was my second visit here and hopefully if we go back to Boston, we will stay here again

<Content>Great Option in Back Bay The Courtyard at Copley Square is a great hotel with a great location in the Back Bay. It's less expensive than the other hotels in the area (Westin's around the corner and Lenox Hotel across the street) and you still get more for your money. Our package included free hot breakfast each morning of our stay. The rooms seem newly rennovated, are very clean and the beds are very comfortable. We were in Boston to see Boston, so we didn't need the extra services that might come with a Westin or larger Marriott, as we were out and about most of the time. We even had a very early flight for which the front desk arranged a car service to pick us up for the airport at 4:30. All in all, great service, great breakfast, great beds and rooms and a very reasonable rate for the area.

<Content>Just what you would expect. Just got back from a 2 night stay here and I was quite satisfied with the hotel. Stayed with my two teens - 16 and 14. We were told only a king was available but that a double queen room would likely come open if we checked in early enough. No such luck so we all crammed in to a King with a cot - no problem but a bit cramped. Very nice room - all the amenities, very quiet and clean. Staff were very pleasent - great suggestions and eager to please. Two problems: (1) The breakfast buffet is overpriced and quite underwhelming - head outside to one of dozens of surrounding restaurants instead; (2) The exercise room is an after thought, tucked into the basement, inferior machines (cardio only as i recall) with no windows and no ventilation and no AC - the room was well over 100 degrees making exercise impossible. For the price this hotel is an excellent choice and I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Value, location and accomidations! I stayed at this hotel last week and was very impressed by the size and comfort of the rooms, the cleanliness, the location and the extra amenities offered by the hotel staff. Being right in downtown Boston and within walking distance of the shops on Newbury Street, the Boston Public Garden and the Copley Place was a wonderful treat. It was even better that the cost was not exorbitant and the rooms were beautiful appointed. There were also great extras such as a chocolate fountain in the hotel lobby for guests to partake in on Tuesday early evenings accompanied by the movie Willie Wonka on a flat screen TV for the kids. I highly recommend this hotel and I will certainly look to stay there again. Great valet parking too - and no more cost than what the parking garage would be!

<Content>Great Room Great Location I booked this hotel after seeing some other good reviews and I was not disappointed at all. I had booked a 2 bed queen suite some time ago but 2 days before we were due to fly I noticed they had a good rate for the Boston Experience Package which included breakfast and tickets for the Duck Tour, science museum and Imax theatre for only $10 more a night. I was able to make the change to this rate on the website. The Hotel location is excellent- close to the Prudential Centre Shops, the Duck Tour and plenty of Restaurants on Boyston Street. The suite (room 509) was lovely - very spacious - bed room with 2 large very comfortable double beds and a seperate living room with sofa bed, second TV etc This was very useful when our 5 yr old son was awake at 3 am and the rest of us wanted to sleep.. Nice bathroom with good quality smellies and bathrobes in the wardrobe. Breakfast was excellent. My kids loved the DIY waffle maker.

<Content>Loved the Courtyard! Loved the Courtyard! I booked this hotel through expedia because we got a good rate (for Boston) 170 bucks (canadian) a night with the Godiva Getaway package. Was a quick 10-15 min trip from the aiport, taxi driver didn't have any problems finding it. Taxi ride was 21.95 not including tip. We took the T back to the airport since we still had our Charlie Cards to use. Front desk was quick and friendly, they were great with directions too. The room was clean and fresh, beds and pillows were the best. The best part was the breakfast (included with the godiva package), it was fabulous. Bacon, sausage, eggs, belgian waffles with WARM REAL maple syrup as well as your regular toast, bagels, cereals and beverages. More than adequate. It was also convienient to the Copley T stop (right around the corner about a 5 min walk). We took the T everywhere, very easy to figure out. Many things are also within walking distance...Newbury Street, Prudential Centre, Boston Common, etc. Great hotel, great comfort, great staff, superb breakfast, good location. I would definetly return.

<Content>A nice surprise off Copley Very nice but small hotel very near the larger Marriott Copley Place. Hard to locate -- my cabbie tried to drop me at the main Courtyard by Marriott downtown. Evidently, this hotel was recently rebranded as a Courtyard.The rooms were normal large-city sized rooms -- in other words, they were a bit small. But for one person or a couple, they are fine. The shower was excellent - large with a good spray. All the room amenities were fairly new and functional. The bed was veyr comfortable and the room very quiet.The only complaints were that the room was quite cold. The thermostat seemed stuck on full air conditioning. This is NOT a full service hotel. No bar or restaurant, but there is much nearby. Cabs are not easy to catch; it's on a side street, but the bellman ran a block away to get me one.Hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful. Nice place to stay.

<Content>Courtyard Boston Copley Square Worth a Look We stayed for 4 nights over Memorial Day Weekend. We got a really good AAA discount. The room was nice enough but no refrigerator as stated on the website. Housekeeping was good enough and did leave extra towels as requested.Free Samuel Adams beer on Thursday night was fun.The location is really great, close to the Duck Tour, close to a couple of malls and Newbury Street. Within walking distance to Copley Square and the Bostix booth. We walked to Boston Common and the Public Gardens, no problem.  I have to admit after reading the excellent reviews I was just a little disappointed. I was definitely expecting too much! I think maybe the sign stating you can get a free $5 Starbucks gift certificate for a Tripadvisor review may be part of the reason for the great reviews.There were a couple of minor negatives: there are a couple of stairs at the entrance of the hotel we had to drag our suitcases up. I don鈥檛 know why it is not a ramp. One of the front desk employees was not very friendly. There were some really strange noises in the room; fortunately only the last night did the noise actually disturb our sleep. We were on the 10th floor, trying to avoid the street noise but I think it was a mistake.Overall for the price I would definitely recommend this hotel

<Content>88 Exeter Historic Hotel I just spent a week staying at this hotel and it was very pleasurable. The staff are very helpful and friendly. They go out of their way to make your stay very enjoyable. The hotel was converted around 2003 from an historic apartment building in Boston known as the 88 Exeter. They have on display various antiques and memorabilia from the building along with the original stained glass window that was in the door of the original building. Everyday the have fresh fruit and homemade baked cookies (the cranberry-nut cookies are yummy) at the front desk for those staying at the hotel. Also, almost every day they have a themed happy hour from 5:30pm to 7:00pm. During my stay they had a massage session one night, a Willy Wonka chocolate tasting an other night and a Sam Adams tasting on another night.The rooms are well decorated, spacious and come equipped with a coffee maker, refrigerator, iron/ironing board, internet connection and bathrobe. It is between Boylston and the Avenue of the Arts right next to the Boston Public Library. Also, it is very close to a Shaws Supermarket if you want to stock up the refrigerator. The hotel also has is own restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch. Give it a try -- you will be very happy you did.

<Content>Recommended Stayed here for three days in March 2007. Room was furnished very nicely. Common areas were small but appropriate to a Courtyard Marriott. Staff was friendly. Workout room was miniscule.

<Content>Fantasitic I just stayed the Courtyard in Copley Square Boston and it was outstanding. I was greeted by a lovely Welcome' when Arrived and was made to feel at ease staight away. The room was something out of this world, a large room with a king bed but it was desinged that you had a feeling of the room being really large. It had a new smell about it, the room was very clean and well appointed. Though for me the best thing were the staff really helpful and they surprised and many occasions they were just fantastic. For example Maddie overheard it was my wife's birthday and secretly sent a bottle of champange to the restaurant she had found for us. On one other delightful occasion we had our trip planned out with trips to musuems etc and at teh end when we came back there was a plate of cookie that they make on the premises but becuase we missed the cookie time they sent some to our bedroom. If ever you go to Boston you really should try the Courtyard it was great for me. Dave Stark

<Content>Nightmare - stay away  After reading all the great reviews here, we decided to try this hotel. It was a complete nightmare!\ First, they tried to charge me for an extra night despite the fact that the manager had communicated to me that would be happened. Then she (the receptionist, one of the rudest people I have ever met) refused to honor the rate I had booked the room at. Thank goodness I had printed out the confirmation. She was nasty about the revised rate. Then she gave us a room that barely fit our luggage, much less a rollaway-again, the confirmation showed we had requested a rollaway. So she pulled a bait and switch and offered us a suite for $75 more, we were exhausted so said we would take it. What a disaster! The pullout couch had a huge hole in it, there was no one to make up the bed and the air conditioner didn't work (which she also refused to believe). It was worn, small and smelled. We left, went to the Fairmont where they treated us like royalty. Just goes to show you get what you pay for

<Content>Not your typical Marriott Courtyard I had never stayed at this Courtyard since I usually stay at the Marriott Copley Place. However, with the Marriott priced at over $400 a night, we decided to try the Courtyard and I was very surprised by how modern, upscale and large the rooms were. As a matter of fact, it made me realize that the big Marriott across the street needed a facelift and that this Courtyard was much nicer in spite of the lower price! (They even offer free high speed wired internet access in all rooms!)Obviously, the drawback to the larger hotels, is that it has a small lobby and restaurant that is more self serve than a real restaurant and that room service is provided by menus from outside restaurants. However, given that you are in Boston, you have many restaurants within walking distance and tend to only stay in the hotel for the night to sleep.I will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it for both business and leisure stays.

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed here this weeekend. The hotel was very nice and the rooms were nicely updated, small, but every room in boston is. We didn't have a refrigerator, or ice on our floor. Those were the only two negatives. We had purchased the rendevous package, and for the extra price we received a half split of champagne and cheap chocolates. I'd skip the package for sure, as we only got that on one of the nights. The breakfast was Ok, but quite unorganized in regards to seating. There was one computer for the hotel to use as the business center. Couldn't ask for a better location, especially if you are taking the duck tour. Walking distance to Back Bay and the South End, Copley and Prudential are out the front door.

<Content>GREAT Hotel-Compares to 5 Star Hotels We stayed in this hotel during the last weekend of October. It was amazing! It is by far the BEST Courtyard we've ever seen. We often stay at higher end hotels (Four Seasons, Ritz, Westin, Fairmont, etc), and this hotel was better than most of these properties! It is a small hotel (81 rooms) with a GREAT location, GREAT service, and GREAT amenities! It is close to everything-T station, Copley Square, hundreds of wonderful restaraunts, great shopping...everything! Using Marriott reward points, we expected an average room. However, we were given a very large room that was much nicer than the room that is pictured online. During our stay, we made several different requests. Each one either met or exceeded our expectations! We visited friends staying at the Marriott Longwharf and felt that our room, location, and amenities were much better than the Longwharf (and less expensive also). Our stay even ended with a nice surprise....a Lincoln Towncar was available to take us to the airport for less than a cab would have cost us. If you are going to Boston, I would definitely check to see if the Courtyard Copley Square is available...you'll be glad that you did! When we return to Boston, this is where we will stay!

<Content>Suprisingly Great! My company booked a room at the Marriot Hotel in Boston and I thought it was the Marriot Copley . I found out that I was at the Courtyard by Marriott accross the street. I was a little upset at first because I was in meetings all day. I never stayed at the courtyard before. I walked in and the check in was easy and fast. The front desk staff was very helpful. They had cookies and fruit in the lobby. A beer tasting ....never heard of that one at a Courtyard but I was educated while drinking beer. Who would have thought of that. I invited a couple of my coworkers staying at a different hotel and we had a wonderful time. I will stay here again. The location is great, complimentary wireless, the decor was very elegant for a Courtyard.

<Content>A hidden Jewel! We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Copley Sq in August and found this 鈥渂outique Marriott鈥?hotel as an exception to the rule.As we checked in, we received an invitation to the evening鈥檚 complimentary activity- their Willy Wonka Chocolate Fountain. We were delightfully surprised and our children were absolutely thrilled! What a great start to our weekend get away to Boston!Our double queen room had 2 queen beds with ample room for my husband and I and 2 kids! The room was clean and in- room refrigerator was an added plus.The close proximity to the Duck Tours across the street and the Shaw鈥檚 Supermarket were 2 more features that made traveling with children as easier venture.The staff couldn鈥檛 have been nicer! We always received a 鈥渉ello鈥?as we passed the front desk and the morning breakfast staff provided very good service. We loved the Boston baked beans with eggs! Tried for the 1st time! Great Location, Marriott Rewards, and great Hospitality made this hotel a great and fun find for us!

<Content>Wonderful hotel! My family (husband, me, two sons, ages 10 and 12) just returned from a three day stay at the Courtyard Boston Copley Square. It's a wonderful hotel in a great location. It's not a large hotel, which gives it a nice, cozy quality. The rooms are a good size. The beds are very, very comfortable! The hotel's location is great - it's right around the corner from one of the Boston Ducks loading sites. It's also about a twenty-minute walk from the hotel to Fenway Park. Copley Square and the Prudential Tower are also nearby, along with many shops and restaurants. We did have a couple of problems during our stay, but the general manager and the front desk were very accomodating and made everything right. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to spend some time in the Back Bay.

<Content>Good Location and good Service Stayed here at the end of a New England tour and for the 4 July celebrations. The hotel is really small for a Marriott, but it still has most of the things you expect. The check in and out was quick and hassle free, they allowed a late checkout without charge or fuss (so we could recover from 4th July celebrations!).They do not have a car park but the valet will park / collect your car from a adjacent public park, there is a huge charge (like all hotels in Boston) of $40 a day. I really recommend NOT DRIVING in Boston as parking is a real problem and expensive. Taxi's are plentiful and fairly cheap the 'T' goes most places tourists want to see.The hotel offers free broadband in the room so take your laptop, but if you need the internet and don't have one (like me), the hotel allows use of their office and internet for free as well.Didn't try breakfast at the hotel but it looked resonable and on a par with places outside.The building is quite old and historical but totally clean and like new inside. The room we had was on the top floor (standard room) with good views across the city, tea coffee makings in the room and a fridge. Also had haridrier and iron / ironing board. Good size closet and plenty of drawer space.The area the hotel is in is just off Newbury with shops / restuarants on the door step so it is great to have a meal and stroll back. Staff were freindly and efficient. Would totally recommend this hotel.

<Content>Right size, Right place, Right price Courtyard by Marriott Copley Square may be a small hotel , b ut it's big on value and in a great location. The staff was very accommodating and the hotel offers weeknight activities in the lobby including beer tasting  chocolate night.Our room was small but adequate. The marble bathroom was quite large given the rest of the room size. The price ( under $260 ) is hard to beat especially where it's located -- Copley Square area. It's within walking distance to all major attractions (trust me, we walked to Fenway Park and back from the Aquarium (different days mind you)). The Prudential Center is a block away as is great shops and restaurants on Boyleston as well as trendy Newbury St.

<Content>Excellent stay that exceeded expectations We stayed here for two nights in the middle of a two week trip to New England. We stayed saturday 3rd June and Sunday 4th June. I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor before we booked and I was not at all disappointed, in fact it surpassed my expectations. The room for us as a family of four (children aged 10 and 8) was of an excellent size (two large beds and still plenty of other space). One of my daughters slept on the windowsill, it was so large and had a padded seat (saved sharing with her sister and fighting all night long!), just wrapped her up in one of the enormous quilt covers. We had a beautiful bathroom and coffee making facilities (which were easily adapted to making tea if you take your own teabags!), had an empty fridge for storing milk etc. an ironing board and iron (not that I used it!) a hairdryer and excellent TV with lots of channels. We couldn't fault them on anything. The room was clean and very comfortable. The staff were excellent, very helpful. The visit coordinator sorted out Duck Tour bookings for me and a restaurant booking for the saturday night (The Atlantic Fish Company on Boylston Street, whch was also excellent and only a 5 minute walk from the hotel). We went to the Boston Tea Party event in the hotel on the Saturday, which was excellent - lovely choice of teas in real muslin teabags in beautiful china cups, accompanied by little sandwiches and cakes (complimentary), excellent and very welcome after a long journey from New Hampshire. My girls were extremely disappointed that we missed a Willy Wonka Chocolate evening whilst there (chocolate fountain), so we will just have to go back and try that out next time. Boston is a fabulous city, feels very safe and there is loads to see. We didn't see it all, so plenty to do on a second trip!! Forgot to mention as well that the breakfast is excellent, well worth the money. Children got to make their own waffles, which was great fun. Buffet was plentiful, with loads of choice.

<Content>Excellence on Exeter St! We stayed here for one night on Feb 10th.This hotel truly is top class for the the money. It is not too big in a convenient location.The staff were very helpful in recommending restaurants, bars and what to do in the city in the short space of time we had.The room served our needs perfectly and the bed was up to the usual Marriott comfort with the featherbed topped mattress and duvet.They were serving a chocolate fondue in the foyer/breakfast area just after we turned up this was complimentary and good fun, I believe they do something similar everyday.We had the continental breakfast buffet the following morning which was very good. Plenty of fresh fruits, yogurts, cereals, pastries, coffee  juice, particularly enjoyed the granola topped yogurt with the strawberries in the base!We would stay here again for sure if ever in Boston again.

<Content>Best Find in the City I work for a fortune 50 company and we held a worldwide meeting at this hotel in December as well as another smaller event in February. The location, the rooms, and most importantly the staff were phenomenal. They go out of the way to make you feel comfortable and at home while in the center of the city. My highest compliments to Eric Churchill, Hotel Manager, Barbara Bowers, Director of Sales and Juliana Roshi, the lead concierge, they went out of their way to work with us on pricing, conference needs, and the hospitality was best in class. They went out of their way to ensure that our people had everything they needed and the hospitality events each evening were unique and enjoyable after a long day. You won't be disappointed if you stay here, the price, location and the people are the best.

<Content>A reasonable option in Boston An older building, nicely restored, with plenty of character. The staff at the hotel was very pleasant. Our room was spacious and pleasant. Unfortunately, it was a low floor overlooking Exeter Street. This was a problem at night as there is a club next door which seems to attract some significant street noise around midnight. As with all downtown Boston hotels, parking is expensive.
