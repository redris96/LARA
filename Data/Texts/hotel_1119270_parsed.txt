<Content>Nice Hotel , Poor Loacation Hotel is nice inside, Breakfast is nice and staff are helpful, Chris from the front desk was very helpful and polite, great bloke! Area that hotel is in is very suspect and does not feel safe, we were advised by many locals not to walk through the homeless area. Our first night was a nightmare as we were shipped off to another hotel due to plumbing issues at Cova. Front desk staff need to be faster and have their act together as things there were very slow. Room size was great and clean. All in all not the worst but a few things need to improve. Good to see they are having a go in a trouble area. Would recommend the free shuttle into town very handy and safe also. Would stay there again if needed.

<Content>Best value for the price Stayed for a Saturday night, the price was excellent compared with prices we got for crappy hotels two blocks away. The neighborhood is not the greatest but it's 10 minutes walk from union square. The rooms are amazing (except the view), compare them to hyatt quality. The staff was helpful, the breakfast decent.

<Content>Liked the Cova - nice hotel, little flaws We stayed at the Cova Hotel for 10 days. The rooms are really nice and staff is generally friendly. Everything is very clean and housekeeping is efficient. As stated in the other reviews, the location is central but not very good. Lots of homeless and strange people on the street. I don't think it's really unsafe but wouldn't recommend the hotel to people who are easily scared or women travelling alone.The breakfast is good compared to other hotel / motels in the US in a similar price range (choice of bagels, eggs, cereal, fresh fruit, waffles) but gets a bit boring after a while when staying longer. Coffee is American style, there's no espresso. The free wireless internet is good but sometimes slow and not very reliable - this could be improved. There is onsite parking but the 25$ a day is more than I paid for my rental car - so I decided to use street parking. It is possible to find street parking around the hotel, but it's metered during the day (9am - 6pm) and you have to carefully watch the signs for restrictions. PLUS: Nice, big and clean rooms, good value for money, free wireless internet, friendly staffMINUS: Location, Parking expensive, Internet slow

<Content>Hotel was good, area might put off some Our stay at the hotel seemed to like alot of other reviews. We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel itself was fine, our room was quite spacious and we had no problems with it. There was a light breakfast. It was a quite a short walk to Union Square. However, the area was that bit unsavoury, our first evening I was a bit unnerved but after that I got used to it, we did walk in the neighborhood in the mornings leaving our hotel and if were back in early evening, however, at night we got a taxi back to the hotel. Nobody ever bothered us so it was fine but I can understand how people might be a little apprehensive. There is so much to see in fabulous San Francisco so we weren't sticking around our hotel area.

<Content>Great Stay Great hotel. Free breakfast. Free Internet. Easy parking onsite. Staff was great.Had an issue with the TV and someone was sent immeadiately to fix it. Had issues with connecting to the internet, an employee was sent up with connection instructions. Nice to have a free breakfast at a hotel in the City.Rooms were very nice. Our bathroom was very spacious. I would stay at this hotel again.Yes, this hotel may not be in the best area, but the hotel staff will call you a cab or direct you the safest way on foot.Looking to stay at this hotel again at the end of September.

<Content>Beautiful Interior, Horrible Area, Very rude and unhelpful staff My mum and I stayed at Cova this July.I will say the rooms were lovely, brand new and very clean!Be warned about the area, Ellis St is nicknamed Crackville. We saw Dozens of people partaking in unsavoury activities day and night on the next block down from the hotel. It is very noisy and there are all sorts of goings on outside the hotel at all hours. Do not walk down Ellis St after dark, whatever you do!!The Staff do not speak very good English and are not helpful at all!When I checked out they charged me $20 for a phone call I didnt make, I had picked up the phone, dialed a number and it was engaged. They insisted on charging me for the call anyway. I was grateful we only had 4 nights there, it was more than enough!!!

<Content>Don`t Stay This hotel has been nicely refurbished inside,rooms are excellent,big modern and clean.Cleaning staff very friendly and give great service.Breakfast is good with good choice and nice roof top room though a bit crowded at times.Location is worst in san fran with drugs prostitution and homeless hanging around.Reception staff are unhelpful while management were downright rude and offensive. Do not trust with credit card imprint ! Restaurant was closed perhaps for renovation could be a great hotel but for unhelpful staff and unfortunate location.

<Content>I was booted to another hotel despite my confirmed reservation I just want other travellers to know that this could happen. I had made reservation via Otels.com. On the day I was to stay there I called the hotel both at their 800 number and at their local number. Each time I got a message saying to leave my number and that I would be called back within an hour. I left 4 messages and was never called back. I finally took a cab to the hotel to check in and was told 'nobody listens to the messages on weekends'. !!! The clerk couldn't find me on the list of expected guests. She went into the back room and returned saying that because my reservation (which had been made 2 weeks earlier) was made very late they would have to send me to another hotel purportedly because of a plumbing problem. I dont really believe there was a plumbing problem but if there was I think it was handled poorly and no matter what they need to answer their telephone and check their messages. They drove me to another hotel (the Sam Wong in chinatown) and thus I did have accomodation for the night, but as you all know all hotels are not the same and we do research to make sure we will have the best possible hotel experience, When these efforts go awry it is frustrating. So to all who decide to try the Cova, beware and good luck . From the lobby it looked like a decent place but the staff have alot to learn about how to run a hotel.

<Content>Huge SURPRISE! We booked this hotel because we were traveling on a budget. We actually booked the room for $125 a night. We were really nervous when we were pulling up, the area seemed a little shady. However, to our surprise we were staying in the most beautiful hotel. Everything on the interior has been remodeled. Its a very very modern hotel. We had flat screen tvs and the most comfortable bed. we had a delicious breakfast on the roof in the morning. We were about a mile from all the major shops and then we took the bus to fisherman's wharf. I think it was like $4 bucks round trip and it took about 15 minutes. We walked at night time from the mall and it was a okay but if I did not have my husband I would have felt unsafe. But you cannot beat this hotel. Its spectacular. I was shocked. We only booked one night because we were unsure and we ended up staying g 3 nights. It was well worth it. I would recommend this for hotel for anyone. Its clean, beautiful and the staff was outstanding. They helped us to get reservations and gave us directions anywhere we needed to go.

<Content>Great rooms and nice service This is a really great hotel. From the outside you first would not expect it as the building is not new, however once you get to the room, it's really luxury. I stayed there shortly before the 4th of July. The staff also let's the guests know that the rooms are completely newly rennovated. One employee of the evening shift asked all the guest who came back in from the city how they liked their room. He was obviously proud of it and he can be. The breakfast is included, the breakfast room (I believe on the 8th floor - not completely sure) is also new and offers a view over S.F. A roof top is in front of the breakfast room. You can easily walk to Union Square, Market Street, etc. and the staff always tell you which way to go (when coming out of the hotel to the left and then right) to avoid the not so nice areas. The breakfast ladies were extremely nice and so were the Front Office employees. When my wireless didn't work in one room, the male employee in the evening immediately gave me a different room. I would definitely go back there, because it's a very personalized atmosphere and a great price.

<Content>Nice Hotel,Not so nice neighbourhood I was here for my convention along with my colleague.The Rooms and shower were pretty good. The staff at the hotel, Mohi especially was very helpful. The breakfast was very nice, with a lot of choice, so you can go out in the morning with a full belly. For eating, Subway and TacoBell KFC , were just around the corner.The only problem was that the TV and internet services they offered were not so good, they were just about OK. Overall enjoyed the stay, got my job done, what i was there for.

<Content>WOW! OMIGOD! The room was beautiful. I travel alot for business, I thought I would get away to San Francisco for the Holiday Week. Of course all rooms were outrageous for a simple room. I found ATH for $120 a day.Yes, like what the other travelers said, the neighborhood isn't rated G or PG13 for that matter, but the rooms completely makes up for it 100%. They were spectacular and incredible.As an epicurean. Let me tell you about Larkin street.(X street) I had one of the most amazing meals there. Pagoluc, a Vietnamese restaurant, served Beef in 7 ways with a bed of exoctic herbs and vegetable. Yummy! Next block down, Bodega, had the best vietnamese noodle soup (pho) and awesome raosted squab with caramerlized onions and raisins. Saigon Cafe and their BBQ chicken sandwiches are out of this world for $2.50! Restaurants are really good around the neighborhood, I was blown away by a few of them. A few blocks away on Polk St. more food. I vegged that week. I went to shows, movie theater is 3 blocks away, Union Square was easy to get to, Transportation was direct and uncomplicated.The beds at ATH were sooo comfy. Clean white sheets, springs on the matress were strong, not lumpy and lobsided, The room had a great scent, uber clean, the bathroom is bigger than my apartment, and get this,the towels were bathsheet size! Slept really well and ate incredibly without breaking the bankI actually felt like I was in my own mordern ashram, because when I left. I actually felt recharged and ready to face the hectic new year. You would love it there, sorry can't say much about the view.

<Content>Little Gem in SF Despite some not so positive reviews - our stay at the hotel was great. We were initially put in a room with a double bed but quickly remedied by Alfonso for a king size. Parking was a cinch  very secure, reasonable rate of $15. Very close walking distance to Union Square. I had no issues with the 鈥渆nvironment鈥?around the hotel its typical SF and we were out walking after 10 pm. If you wish to walk best to go up 1 or 2 blocks and walk down O'Farrell or Geary Street as these streets were far nicer to walk down. The room was beautiful 鈥?remodeled. The bed was fantastic especially the pillows. Flat screen tv 鈥?although I recommend covering the blue light on it b/c it did wake me  they have an ipod type alarm clock. Breakfast was quick (typical continental), top floor 鈥?great views  I didn鈥檛 expect much, but I would for sure stay again there. Skip eating at Kuletos - I got food poisening!

<Content>Diamond in the Rough I would have rated this hotel 'above average' had it not been for the undesirable location. First off the door to the hotel is located to the left of the Japanese restaurant. The lobby is nothing to write home about. When I made my reservation online I asked for a remodeled room. I was given room 305 and it was amazing. Everything in the room was modern and new. Triple sheeting on the comfy queen size bed, flat screen t.v, oblong leather ottoman at the foot of the beds, beautiful sage green sateen curtains, nice green chair in the corner, the bathroom was amazing. Everthing was shiny and new. The sink in the bathroom was ultra modern and the swing out shower curtain rod gives you more room to move around. The continental breakfast on the 8th floor was great. The breakfast room was decorated beautifully with calming colors and pictures and wooden floor boxes. The breakfast selection included name brand juice, tea, coffee, hot choclate, cup o noodles, fruit, yougurt, waffles, croissants, bagels, wheat  white bread. I saw a young group of business travelers, a few couples. I would not recommend this hotel if you are traveling with children because it's not fun explaining the triple X shops all around the area.Underground secure parking is $15 and I would NOT recommend using public transportation at night in this area.

<Content>Fooled Do not be fooled by the pictures of this hotel on line or the 2 star rating that price line has it listed for. It is also listed in the Cathedral Hill district, which is not true. This hotel is a complete dump and is in the worst part of San Francisco according to our taxi driver. We booked it for three nights and just stayed one night and that is only because we arrived into town so late. There are homeless people everwhere because there is a homeless shelter right beside the hotel, in addtion there are hookers and drug dealers. So I guess if you are looking for this type of entertainment then it may suite you, but for a family and average person I wouldn't recommend it. There was actually a shooting right outside of the hotel the second day we were in San Francisco. My husband went to go get our bags to change them to the new hotel and there were police everywhere and he was told two guys were shot and one was killed. I will give it to them that they keep it clean and the continental breakfast area is decorated nicely. I'm not sure how they got the pictures of the rooms to look so nice online because it does not look at all like that when you walk in. So from a very unpleased customer I advise you to stay clear of this hotel and if you already have reservations just cancel them now and find a new hotel. Trust me it is worth the time and money!

<Content>Great bargain hotel! This hotel has just been refurbished and as it stands is an absolute bargain. The rooms are clean, the beds are comfy, it has flat screen tvs on the wall and the bathroom is lovely including a great shower. The room was also nice and spacious. I would warn that the area it is in is not the best, just mainly homeless people that are harmless enough but also some prostitute/pimp types around that are a little more intimidating. Overall it is the perfect place to stay on a budget for younger travelers, maybe not ideal for families or the elderly.

<Content>Great Deal at the Air Travel The hotel looks the same as it did when I used to stay here - but the new floor that I stayed on had the most amazing rooms. Everything was new and even the lobby looked better than the last time I was here over a year ago. There are big flat screen tvs on the wall and the beds are new.The free breakfast was also much better than I expected.I love the Tenderloin and I am very glad I do not have to find an alternative to the great deal at the Air Travel Hotel

Don't come hear for the hotel, say here for the fantastic restaurants that are literary 10 yards away. It's also hand for buses and cable cars to the tourist areas.The are is a definite no - no for single travellers and familys with young children (What's that daddy ?, That's a syringe, dear.

<Content>Sketchy A buddy and I did a road trip across the western united states and most of the nights we slept in the back of my van. When we got to San Francisco we realized that it wouldn't be safe to do that. We randomly stumbled on the Air Travel hotel (a fancy chinese food and hotel in one!). It wasn't much better than sleeping in the van. (Though it felt nice to have a shower)Pros: Secure underground parking in a sketchy area. Not a bad bed.Cons: Door connecting to other room was open. Really old and run down. Smelled funny. Terrible neighborhood. I would stay here again if the YMCA was full. But if I was planning a trip to SF again, I'd find somewhere else.

<Content>OK hotel, AWFUL neighborhood The hotel was OK (although it didn't have working air conditioning in the room), but the neighborhood was the worst. It's located in the heart of the tenderloin, and there were drug dealers outside of the property.The room and the entire hotel were clean. The staff was friendly and you can't beat the price -- especially if you take into consideration the free parking!! But I, personally, wouldn't go back. I'd rather pay a bit more and stay someplace else.

<Content>One word - "dump" Bad enough the hotel is a dump, but add a less than friendly staff for total discomfort. The place might not be quite as bad if they at least pretended to take an interest in guests comfort. Seems $ is what matters most. I didn't like my room partially because of the southern exposure. (No a.c. which is common in SF, but it was unseasonably hot and faced directly south. The room baked to well over 90+ degrees each day.) I asked if they had a fan - no. Could I have a different room - no. Well then I found somewhere else to stay for the remainder of my trip, and they charged me a $50 early check-out fee. The room was fairly spacious but the furniture was shabby at best. The curtains were tattered. The bathroom had a thick layer of old dirt and scum that would require a remodel to get rid of, not just a good scrubbing. There was hair on the bathtub and sink from another guest. The tub drain was sluggish and I had to shower in standing water. The toilet flushed inadequately. Sometimes there was scalding hot water, sometimes no hot water. There is no fan in the cave-like bathroom - no air circulation. The hallways had a funky musty stale smell, beat up old carpeting and dingy walls. I read other reviews which seemed to focus on t he neighborhood. The homeless situation is yet another reality of San Francisco. I find them harmless. They are not violent or mean. They just happen to be on the street. It's heartbreaking. Besides, the review is supposed to be of the hotel, not the city of SF. I wouldn't stay at the Air Travel Hotel again if it was offered free. I'll just chalk it up to making a big mistake, and move on. Never again!

<Content>cheap hotel, but San Francisco...? The hotel was basic, but that's what we expected for the price. Rooms clean, but dated. Double room had a little kitchenette with Fridge. Air-con, but ours must have been turned off. Shower great if your 5ft tall!No breakfast was included, but there are loads of restaurants  cafes down Geary Street, e.g. Lefty O'Douls, which is one of the most reasonably priced.Next door is a Chinese restaurant (hotel is run by Chinese staff, so there may be a connection). A couple of blocks away (on Geary St) is a Pizza hut take away, so when we were tired we ate here.The area was a bit of a shock to us however. We're from London so have experienced our fair share homeless people, but this did not prepare us for San Francisco. e.g. You walk out of a large shop on Market Street (main street), walk down one block, you suddenly meet about 20 homeless people. Not threatening, but I'm sure they are opportunists  I wouldn't want to walk past them when it's dark or alone.The hotel was only 4 blocks from Civic Centre, but to get there you have to pass at least 2 groups of homeless people.The hotel even suggests keeping cash, passport in an inside pocket of your clothing  getting a a taxi if your away from the hotel past 10pmThe free internet was good, but had to get the hub rebooted a couple of times (on the 3rd floor) when the service went down. I met the guy who was supporting the network  they are installing extra wireless routers on 2 of the floors to improve the signal strength.Hotel desk staff not too helpful, better to do things yourself (on internet) than ask. Night staff particularly awkward (e.g. remote control for TV not working, I'll look into it, but never did, we had to complain twice.)
