<Content>Avoid! Avoid! Avoid! Booked Hyatt Regency for the proximity to Madeleine, one of the nicest area in Paris. The hotel is OK overall, we liked the lobby area, the bar/restaurant and especially the cafe that serves breakfast until 1 or 2pm on weekends. The room was quite small, but you expect that in Paris. Avoid the SPA area which is a joke, and also the massage offering which is provided by an external company. Very bad experience. The worst moment was check-out. We checked-out, and we left our suitcases in the luggage room. We realized we forgot some clothes in the room, and requested them only two hours later when we returned to get the suitcases. At that moment we were returned everything BUT the leather jacket, the most expensive item of all. It has never happened to us to have our clothes STOLEN in a hotel before, and we would not have expected that from a Hyatt. The hotel failed to solve our issue, so our stay was ended with a bitter taste about the staff at Hyatt Regency Madeleine. Too bad for them, the property was ok overall.

<Content>A reality check -- please!!! I just returned from three nights at the Hyatt Regency Paris Madeleine, and overall, the reviews on this site are accurate. I would rate the property a low 4, but I acknowledge that I have no familiarity with other hotels in Paris. Perhaps it really is as good as some claim.Check in 鈥?quick, accurate but not that friendly. I was pleased that my room was ready on arrival at 1 pm. Entering the Executive King (204, right next to elevator, when I had asked specifically to be far from it), I was hit with blast furnace heat. I tried to adjust the thermostat, but could only turn it on or off with various fan settings. The room was very quiet, however, with double pane windows, but I knew that I would have to open some windows to relieve the heat. And it was very noisy with the fresh air. So I went back to front desk and asked to be moved. The room - they were happy to move me, and within a few minutes I was shown a second room, a Deluxe King, for 100 euro less a night. This room was extremely quiet, overlooking a courtyard, even with the windows open (although I agree with other reviewers about doors slamming, footsteps, construction pounding, and other interior hotel noise). The size of the two rooms seemed to be the same, although the Deluxe bathroom was bigger. It also looked a bit dingier 鈥?carpet were not that clean, there were three insufficient lights (the room was rather dark), and other than an uncomfortable desk chair, no place to sit. There was very little tabletop space, and no clock anywhere. A large flat screen TV worked the first day but did not the day I checked out. The bed was hard as rocks (much like those in China) with a nice sheets and a good duvet (but a bit hot). Wireless internet access was available for 23 Euro a day. The minibar was the move anything get charged type, but there was a small area for personal stuff. The bathroom 鈥?spacious, well-lit, sufficient towels. Tub was difficult to get in and out of and the rain shower, with water falling straight down, made it hard not to bump into the temperature water control knob. I had problems with temperature control throughout my stay (including in the shower). Whatever came out of the vents was very warm, so I opened the windows. But once the windows were open, the heating shut off. Meaning that it was have the windows closed and bake or open them up and freeze.Restaurants 鈥?Caf茅 M was the location of the continental breakfast each morning. It鈥檚 a dark, sexy space, with comfortable chairs and nice soothing music. I thought the buffet was very good, even at about 35 Euros. The attendants were polite and helpful and the food was filling and of high quality. I also ate lunch at La Chinnoserie and was pleased with the quality of the food and the service. Fitness center/spa 鈥?there is a small exercise room, a relaxation lounge, and locker rooms with steam and sauna. The Hyatt website is misleading about the services offered though. I booked a manicure and pedicure, expecting something like what you get in the US with a soak, scrub, moisturizer and massage, as well as a polish. The esthetician came in with a suitcase of equipment and I had to sit on a table like at a doctors office. I wasn鈥檛 sure about the cleanliness of the implements, and the services were really just cut, shape, and polish. Very, very expensive for this minimal treatment.Location 鈥?good, but not great, in my opinion. A few blocks from two metro stations. Sidewalks in Paris can be bumpy and uneven, which makes for strenuous walks. Monoprix is a few blocks north, good to pick up stuff so you don鈥檛 have to pay extortionist prices from the minibar. There was absolutely nothing open on Sunday. All in all, I was not bothered by the price or the size of the room, but the lack of a chair, poor lighting, little desktop space, no clock, and impossible temperature control made my stay less than satisfactory.

<Content>Great Hotel but very expensive My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights in late October using Hyatt Gold Passport points to pay for our room. Good thing too, for this hotel was expensive, but then everything in Paris is expensive.Check-in was flawless and the staff speaks good English. The room was large and well appointed, with a comfortable bed, very high quality Duvet, and lots of big fluffy pillows. Lots of light fixtures with nice bright reading lights. Good writing desk, though the desk chair was a little uncomfortable. There was a nice stuffed chair in the room which was good for reading.Big bathroom with good shower and large fluffy towels. Two telephones and a fancy clock/radio/CD player unit. Bottles of water were provided. There was a large Phillips flat screen TV. The room was very quiet and no outside noise could be heard.Any complaints? A couple minor ones. I took a 300 ml plastic water bottle from the minibar so I could get the bottle to use when we walked around town and after being charged 9 euros for this little bottle of water (outrageous) the housekeeping staff took the bottle and I could never get it replaced. Also as is typical at Hyatts worldwide, the Internet charges were exorbitant at 18 euros for 24 hours. Free service was available in the Business Center, but it only had one terminal and a non-standard European Keyboard that was very difficult to use.Breakfast was very expensive in the hotel at 22 euros for a continental breakfast of coffee and four pieces of bread, or 32 euros for one including some meats and cheeses. We only did this once, and afterward opted to go out to one of the many fine eating places only a block or two away. The cost of breakfast frightened us away from trying dinner there.But overall this was a great hotel, located conveniently to both the Madeline and St. Augustine metro stations. The staff was excellent and very attentive, and service was impeccable. If you can afford it this is a great hotel.

<Content>Fabulous Small Details We ended up at the Hyatt due to a booking snafu, and we were thrilled with the hotel. We especially loved the fact that we could exchange dollars into euro without a service fee. The turndown service included 2 bottles of Evian on the bedside tables. We were able to choose the English language Herald Tribune for delivery in the morning so we could keep track of US news (along with CNN and BBC on TV). There are several brasseries in walking distance for dinner with great dinner options (we found the hotel options a little pricey). Monoprix up the street is a great resource for snacks, extra bottled water, and juice. It was perfect for my husband and me, but may not be a good fit for families.

<Content>Great location for shopping We stayed in this hotel during our last trip to Paris and it was excellent. Hotel is completely new or/and refurbished. Beds were great, breakfast was delicious, gym was small but had all the equipments needed to stay in shape including a sauna. Staff at reception was nice and helpful... much better service than the snobish Park Hyatt near Place Vendome... and equally close to all the department stores and shops near Madeleine.

<Content>Exceeded expections What a fabulous hotel, it is on the scale of a boutique hotel but it is a Hyatt. We had just come from a Mandarin Oriental in Switzerland and my expections were not that high for this Hyatt hotel yet it was far superior to the Mandarin.The service here was fantastic. Every single staff member went out of their way to accomodate every request we made. The rooms are quite large and well appointed. We were traveling with our mother and they put us in two corner rooms that we were essentially able to turn into a suite with a private adjoining hallway. I can't say enough about this hotel. The location is great, very accessible to everything but not right in the middle of all the tourist traffic. ++++

<Content>Very very good choice for Paris Was in Paris just for one night for a business dinner. I chose this hotel because of the brand name and the location. I was not disappointed. Excellent (i.e. smiling and efficient) staff at the reception. Large room, which is difficult to find in Paris (although that was expected at the Hyatt, for 390 euros). Very large flat-screen and swiveling TV. I had a siesta around 5-7 PM and then I went out to dinner. When I came back the room was cleaned, the bed was made and everything (included my stuff) was in the right place.Overall experience: excellent. I rated this hotel four stars instead of five because I wasnt able to test other aspects of the hotel (business centre, bar, breakfast, gym, if there was one). But as far as I could see this was basically perfect. I would insist in particular on the staff, the service and the size of the room.

<Content>A great find Centrally located within easy walking distance of the Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, fabulous shops and excellent restaurants (Maxim's is just around the corner!), this hotel was a real treat to stay in. With a very stylish and modern bar/foyer area, the real surprise was the size of the deluxe rooms and the ensuite bathrooms. We were travelling in a party of eight and most of us had stayed in Paris before - without exception we all agreed that the rooms were the best we had stayed in for this calibre of hotel.The only criticism, if you could call it that, was that the breakfast was expensive (we had booked on a 'bed only' basis but two couples tried the breakfast one morning). However, there were plenty of cafes nearby where we could get a croissant and ad lib coffee.The staff were most helpful throughout our stay and the hotel website has a great concierge facility through which we booked transport from the airport when we were making our reservations.Overall, we would all recommend this hotel, particulary for couples wanting to experience the best of Paris virtually on the doorstep - a highly enjoyable experience. We won't hesitate to return.

<Content>Great Hotel!! A very small Hyatt right in one of the best districts of Paris. Because of this, its pricey.However, because its small (they say its the smallest Hyatt in the world) it gives a very personal touch to service which is nice - makesone feel at home which is not a common feeling in Paris!Rooms are very comfortable and well equipped although the Air Conditioning in mine didn't work!!There is a bit of a shortage of dining outlets but what there is is good. Its probably best to eat out.Well worth a visit if you are looking for a smaller, friendly hotel.

<Content>Good location; good service; comfortable rooms We stayed at this hotel for two night in October 2007. The hotel is undergoing renovations on the exterior, so the hotel entrance is covered in scaffolding, but other than that, the renovation had little impact on our enjoyment of the property.The staff are friendly and efficient - check in was relatively seamless.The hotel is quite small. The reception and lobby area are both quite small, but I suppose not unusual for Europe. The rooms are small but very nicely furnished and very comfortable.There is a small spa/sauna in the basement, but it was not particularly inviting or well-patronised.The best thing about this hotel is perhaps its location in the heart of very cosmopolitan Madeleine.

<Content>Convenient location. Tiny room. Just back from a weekend here while watching the end of the Tour de France. The hotel is quite convenient for the central sites, but a little way from a decent choice of bistros. There is some refurbishment going on which means only one restaurant is open, but there was no noise (or any sign of) workmen. But then it was France, on a weekend.For 380鈧?I thought the room was tiny, but well presented. Compared to, for example, the Hyatt Great Eastern in London where we stayed at the beginning of July, where the room was about 3 times the size for nearly half the price.We did get a 50cl bottle of red wine and a bottle opener as a welcome present, although I haven't tried it yet so couldn't comment on that.The reception staff were perfectly nice, and service at breakfast was fine. Breakfast was everything we wanted, but not the range you might find in other Hyatts.We ate dinner in the Hotel's Cafe M on Sunday night. For 190鈧?including 4 glasses of wine I thought it at best average. My braised beef was very hot and with a slight film on the liquid suggesting it had been too close to a microwave. The female waiter suggested a good wine match for my starter, but her male colleague clearly had no idea about matching desert wines which weren't remotely sweet and didn't work at all with our choices.

<Content>Hyatt is just a hyped (and expensive) travelodge I stayed here two years ago and had a great stay - good room, nice service, and free minibar on the deal. This time, however, standards had slipped, and I now had a dingy and too-small-for-the-680euros-price room (which, honestly, is no bigger than a travelodge room with an oversized bathroom). Complained, but no help - that was the price for a night - and now all I can hear is sex from the next room (which you can also hear from the corridor as the room gives right onto it (no entrance way), the TV doesn't work and the staff are just too officious for their own good. It's a shame as the last stay was perfect - I fear they are a bit too precious about themselves now. I like the ambience here, it's just the rooms and the people - I heard two more people complaining at reception.Plus 110 euros for a lobster dish in the restaurant? pah.

<Content>loved it! I stayed here on my last trip to Paris with my sister and parents. We had two rooms on the same floor. Surprisingly, for European standards, our room was quite large. And it was modern yet stylish. The bathrooms are huge and comfortable and the service was very good. Maybe not as wonderful as the Plaza Athenee where we stayed before, but definitely pleasant and helpful, and not at all snobbish like some reviewers stated. For what we paid (around 350 Euro) the hotel is first class and the location is excellent- close to everything, but on a quiet street. Well worth it and I would highly recommend!

<Content>Nothing wrong, but a bit bland Spent 1 night in a deluxe room for the rather scary rate of Euro 455, room only. The room is very modern with a flat screen TV, in typical Hyatt style (ie huge bathroom, with a massive stand alone shower, with smaller than usual bedroom). There is nothing wrong with this place - the room looks like it was refurbished very recently, and the location is great for tourists. It is very bland, though, especially compared to somewhere like InterContinental LeGrand nearby which takes your breath away and is a far bigger property. Some odd things put me off as well - my room overlooked the central courtyard which led to a slight problem with light from the spotlights outside. The TV was also unplugged when I got into the room, and the check-in guy was convinced I had stayed there before! (Welcome back, this time you are on the 4th floor)Nice touches were the free newspapers in the lobby (although I wouldn't have needed one if the newspaper I had requested had actually been delivered to me) and free internet in the tiny business centre - but there is only 1 PC. Overall, you won't have any major complaints here but you won't be rushing home to tell your friends about it either. I recommend it mainly for anyone who insists on a modern, fully refurbished room when they travel.

<Content>Fabulous stay The hotel staff were polite and attentive. The rooms were clean, beautiful and well kept. We received an adjoining room for our children with a shared entry way that was an excellent arrangement for family accomodations. The guest relations manager was excellent and went above and beyond in making arrangements for us. The hotel is in the heart of Paris and within walking distance of the Louve, Eiffel Tower, Les Invalides, even Notre Dame (if you are not in a hurry). The hotel is also just a few blocks from the Madeleine square where you can connect with several of the subway lines. I'd highly recommend purchasing a six day subway ticket if you are going to stay for a week or more -- the subway is easy and goes everywhere. Don't miss breakfast in the nearby Cafe Madeleine -- it's charming and wonderful.We'll definitely stay at this hotel when we return.

<Content>Absolutely perfect in every way! MY husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Madeleine for a long weekend and truly could not have had a more perfect experience. The hotel is absolutely lovely. It only has 86 rooms so you get the best of both worlds- the boutique charm and size size coupled with the professionalism and care of a major worlwide chain . The decor is great -- a modern yet comfortable Parisian look. Our room was just fabulous with a large king size bed with crisp white linens, feather pillows, and a feather duvet. The drapes were plush and oversized giving the modern room a very warm feel. There was a huge flat screen TV and movies on demand along with your basic international channels like BBC and CNN etc. The room has high speed internet access if you need to bring work with you or their business center has free internet as well. The bathroom was amazing with mirrored walls and marble flooring. There was a huge jacuzzi tub and a seperate shower with great water pressure. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was so incredible to see at night when we were getting ready for the evening. The staff is just so helpful and FRIENDLY (don't listen to the rumors about mean Parisians) and go out of there way to make your stay great. Ask for the concierge, Aurore Dinis, if you go. She sat down with us for a glass of champagne when we arrived to help us figure out where we should eat each night etc. She made all the bookings for us and her suggestions could not have been better. She even helped us with a personal errand on her day off after we left because my husband bought something in the wrong size --so she exchanged it for us and had it sent to us the next day! Now that is service. We have been alot of places and have never been treated so well.They convert their sitting area in to a restaurant for meal times which is so great because you feel like you are eating in your living room. We had breakfast at the hotel every morning and it was just fabulous. We also had lunch on our last day and it was delicious as well. The location is great. My husband and I walked everywhere on our trip because the weather was nice (It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the Louvre) and felt like that was a sight in its own. Just walking through the streets of Paris is a joy so it makes the effort worth the while. Plus, then you can eat all the french food you want. However, apparently their metro is great.We could not recommend this hotel more highly. Finding the perfect hotel in a huge city can be hard, but trust me, this is it! Look no further.

<Content>Boutique Hyatt The Madeleine nicely balances the features of a boutique hotel (fewer rooms, understated and well-appointed decor, warm service and quiet location) with the standard Hyatt amenities found across the chain. My mother and I stayed here for four nights and found the front desk to be very welcoming, and helpful with restaurant and tour reservations. We give the Madeleine top marks for cleanliness; the linens were bright and fresh. The room size was perfectly fine, in line with urban European hotels although those accustomed to American Hyatts may find issue with them. There is a small room just off the front desk where one can use the Internet, without charge, to keep family and friends updated. We loved the location, close to boutiques as well as Galeries Lafayette and Printemps (though Le Bon Marche on the Left Bank is better edited) for shopping, the Opera Garnier for those interested in the arts, and Fauchon, Hediard, Kayser (the best croissants and baguettes; the hotel breakfast pales in comparison) and Senderens for those interested in food. Our taxi driver was initially confused as to the Madeleine's location (the sign is very discreet). Overall, the Madeleine provides a nice compromise with a Parisian feel and the lack of unpleasant surprises (as well as the opportunity for pleasant surprises) that some find comforting in an international chain. I would recommend this hotel for solo travellers, business travellers, mother-daughter pairs and more mature couples (younger couples and families with children may find the hotel and neighbourhood not so exciting).

<Content>Good room, Poor Service The service at the hotel was poor for the price paid. Staff at the front desk tended to be supercilious and arrogant and one staff member even made fun of their whining American guests. Part of the package included a fruit basket being delivered nightly to the room; when asked why we were not recieving it, we were turned away by staff member who told us that that we were not entitled to it! Staff would make assertions that certain things had been done etc, without checking if things had been done. In other words, appearances seem to be more highly valued than actually being helpful. Further, the staff booked a French speaking tour for us, even though we only speak English. Breakfast was extremely limited, only the basics were provided and one of the staff serving tea would refuse to speak English and was quite testy. One morning we could hear screams and raucous laughter coming from the kitchen which is adjacent to the breakfast dining area, until a waiter had to go in and tell the chefs to quieten down. Highly unprofessional for such a high class hotel.On a positive note, the executive room at the Hyatt was exceptionally clean, modern and spacious and was tastefully decorated. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our room and there was even a box of welcome candies under the xmas tree in our room.

<Content>A Little Slice of Paris - Live Like The Locals Do... My husband and I did a two week tour of France for our honeymoon (Nantes, Bourdeaux, Avignon, Lyon, Paris)- almost three years ago. We stayed at The Hyatt Madeleine in Paris for the final leg of our journey for four nights/five days. I didn't know about this web site until recently or I would have posted our feedback after our trip. I figure it's never too late to give feedback! We really liked the style of this hotel - small, boutique and right in the middle of real French neighborhoods. We enjoyed walking around the area each morning and evening and eating at local bistros and restaurants as do the locals and shopping where they do each day. (We recall the restaurant across the street from the hotel did a great job at making a fine French ravioli dish one night - who would have thought the French could do a great pasta dish but, they did! We ended up eating there two nights due to this and the owner gave us complimentary wine and desert the second time - how nice!!!). From the hotel, it's a few quick blocks to the Place de la Concorde, Fouchons, Maximes, The Louvre, The Tuillieres Gardens, The River Seine, a Metro station and more. Great location if you ask me. Much like other reviewers, we agree the room we got was VERY small. Room for a queen sized bed, one night table, a desk/chair, tv and just enough room to pass by each other if we didn't each too much each night! The furniture, textiles etc. were all in good shape and the bathroom was top notch and modern as can be (you will give this place high marks after spending weeks throughout France and seeing what they call bathrooms in many places - holes in the ground...no wash clothes...no ice....limited towels...carpet that is like burlap to the feet and more!). LIke many hotels in Europe, the AC and heat are PRE-regulated so, don't try adjusting up and down all the time - they don't allow that as they conserve energy more than we do. The lights also don't go on unless you put in your room card - that way - when you leave, lights have to go off again - more energy conservation. We had a courtyard view - so-so. Room service was always prompt - including the food service and the cleaning staff. The front desk and concierge were very nice to us and very helpful. We especially enjoyed one bell hop who spoke many languages and was always chatty and friendly. We should have told them we were on our honeymoon and gotten a better room but, they appeared booked so, we didn't want to up and move in the middle after we had already done so much travel. We lived with it and it was fine. Like anything...try learning a little French and using it as much as you can. Even though we spoke it poorly, our attempts and smiles went a long way to good treatment both at the hotel and in the city. I had two years of French and french grandparents - that helped a bit. My husband had no French - although he did the accent poorly and massacred a few words - the French gave us two thumbs up for our honest attempts at the language and customs. We plan to return to Paris more than once to finish seeing all that we didn't before. We would consider this hotel again - just a bigger room with a better view.

<Content>The staff makes the difference The Hyatt Paris- Madeleine is a wonderful hotel. The rooms are a little on the small side, typical of European botique hotels. This 82 room gem is nicely located in the Madeleine district with great proximity to the Opera district as well as the Champs Elysees. The lobby is bright, airy and very welcoming. The breakfast is quite good although 28 Euro for continental breakfast is a bit steep. What really makes this hotel is the staff. From the reception staff at the front desk to the servers in the lobby to the housekeepers on the floors, these people were the most engaging, friendly, welcoming staff I've ever encountered. The concierge were very helpful with recommendations for restaurants as well as directions to the sites and even made SNCF reservations for us. Our stay was perfect and it was all about the people that made this hotel fantastic!!

<Content>Sublime Maybe it was the slow December season, maybe it was because I'm a diamond level Hyatt goldpassport member, but my three days at this hotel were truly memorable, in general for the well-appointed comfort, but in particular because of the friendly, well trained/meaning and helpful staff. This is a well managed chain hotel that is up there with the boutiques. I spend over 150 nights a year in hotels, my three nights at this Hyatt on vacation AND using reward points was truly memorable. You can't buy a better location.

<Content>Pluses and Minuses I spent 5 nights at the Hyatt while attending a conference in Paris. This boutique hotel should get an A+ for very tasteful decor. There is a central lobby reception area which multitasks as an all purpose bar/lounge/breakfast room and dinner hall with a beautiful glass ceiling affording a lovely nighttime view. Hotel service was friendly and competent. The health club was excellent and was always empty since no one exercises in Paris. My standard room over the central courtyard was very quiet and stylishly contemporary with high ceilings but the size of a walk-in closet. There is no dresser in the room so I used my suitcase for storage. The only room chair was at the desk. The bathroom was luxurious but lacked an exhaust fan or space for toiletries. The neighborhood is very nice and the hotel is 2 min. from the Metro. I'd go again if alone but the rooms are too small to comfortably accomodate two people. Also, check out Air India Business Class to Paris, it's wonderful and inexpensive.

<Content>Well located and peaceful This hotel has had varied reviews on TA, but I was pretty impressed after a recent long weekend stay. The hotel is pretty new and well located, in my view, in the 8th arrondisement, near the shopping areas on Boulevard Haussmann and Rue du Faubourg St Honore, It is 5 minutes walk from Place de la Concorde, and has good Metro links to other parts of the city. The area is quiet at night, but good restaurants and bars are a short walk away.We has a Deluxe Room, which was nicely laid out, clean and reasonable size. The bathroom was spacious with a bath and separate double shower. The room overlooked the internal courtyard and was therefore quiet. We had breakfast in the lobby area, which I thought was very nice. More relaxing to sit in than the restaurants in some hotels. The nearby Cafe M also looked very nice. The check-in and service staff were very helpful throughout our stay. I have no difficulty in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Worth every Euro! Just returned from our first trip to Paris and were extremely apprehensive about the choice of hotel. We chose the Hyatt Madeleine from descriptions and photos online and couldn't be happier with our choice! This really felt like a 5-star hotel. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful, the service left you feeling pampered (small welcome gifts, weather updates with turndown service, robes, slippers). The spa, although small, was wonderful and in six days, we had the spa to ourselves. The location is fantastic. You could literally walk everywhere, sightseeing, shopping, metro, bus tours. We had a room on the third floor facing the front with floor to ceiling windows. It really made all the difference to have a view up and down the boulevard. With so many beautiful sights to see in the city, we did really enjoy staying in the hotel as well. Would absolutely stay again!

<Content>Great Hotel Once a year, my family and I like to go to Paris and stay at the Hyatt Regency Madeleine. The hotel used to be a hidden gem but is now gaining notoriety as one of Paris's secret hotspot hotels. The staff are very, very attentive and friendly. If you can avoid getting the 'Queen' Room, every other room is fantastic. I'd say the Queen Rooms (because of size) are the only draw to the hotel's accomodations although they are nicely furnished and comfortable.Room 304 is an executive deluxe room and is absolutely fantastic. I can say in the past 4 stays, I've always had a good experience with the Hyatt Madeleine.

<Content>Small Rooms and an Indifferent Staff My wife and I arrived about 1:00 PM after a long flight from Los Angeles and perhaps not surprizingly were unable to check into our room. That would not have bothered me had someone been available to help with the luggage. It was only after I carried our bags to the front desk, confirmed that the room was not ready and then stood around in the lobby for another ten minutes before anyone arrived to help with the bags. The room was small but comfortable. Breakfast was served in the loby area which was not large enough to handle those seeking to eat at 9:00 AM. The best reason to stay at this hotel is the location.

<Content>A good city hotel I found this hotel in line with other Hyatts around the world. The check in staff were polite and courteous, as were the bell boys etc. The only thing that let this hotel down was the restaurant. Whilst the food quality is excellent, the service is awful, with us being rushed all the time by the waiters, and certainly not the type of service I have experienced at nearly every other restuarant in France an Paris.I would certainly stay there again, but eat at one of the million other restaurants nearby.

<Content>Good and Bad I just returned from a trip to Paris with 3 friends where we stayed in a deluxe room at the Hyatt Regency Madeleine. The hotel looks visually beautiful but we had some problems during our stay. The A/C didn't work in one room while the other room was cool. We called the first night about the A/C and were told that someone from engineering would come to fix it the next morning. We asked if we could switch rooms but the hotel was sold out. Nobody came the next day so we called again during daytime hours. Someone came in and worked on the A/C for awhile, tested the temperature and left. It got even hotter. We were able to cool the room by opening the window, but we were over the street so there was a lot of road noise which made it difficult to sleep or even hear our TV. There also is no bar in the hotel - just table service in the lobby. The atmosphere is very upscale and I travel a lot on business and like to stay in nice hotels, but it feels a bit stuffy at this Hyatt (both literally and figuratively).If you are concerned about being able to control the climate in your room, make sure you ask if the A/C or heating is individually controlled. I found out that in these older hotels in Europe, even if there is a thermostat in your room, that doesn't mean that you can really control the temperature. It's pretty much on winter (heating) or summer (cooling) overall, and controlled from a central location.

<Content>A wonderful stay! I stayed at the hotel over the New Year's holiday with my sister and had a perfectly enjoyable experience! The staff was very gracious and accomodating -- even before we arrived. I emailed the hotel about our early arrival and Paris and requested an early-check-in and a need for two twin beds. I received an immediate response reassuring me that they would have our room ready for us upon arrival. Our room was perfect. We had a small welcoming gift from the hotel manager waiting for us, robes and slippers and a charming turndown service every night that included a note with the weather for the following day and recommended sights/events. The location was wonderful as well. Just a few steps from so many sights and great shopping! I have visited Paris the last 3 years over the Christmas holidays and this by far was the loveliest hotel and location. I would recommend this hotel to colleagues traveling on business as well as family and friends traveling for pleasure.

<Content>Very Glad to Move to the Park Hyatt We spent one night here, due to inability to secure reservations at the Park Hyatt Place Vendome all 6 nights. It has a classy entrance, although reception staff less than warm. We were told we were upgraded to a 'deluxe' room  shown what was basically enough room for 1 bed  a desk with a view of the street ( not a very attractive street, BTW). Expressed extreme displeasure with this  were told for 100 E more we could upgrade to a Jr. Suite on the 4th floor. This had an entranceway  somewhat larger room (not by much). The balcony was nice  we could see the top of the Eiffel Tower. Breakfast was so-so  I just felt the staff felt they were doing us all a favor by even being there. Location is ok, but on a rather grungy part of Blvd. Haussmann. I think this is a disappointment for the very high rates  was surprised it got so many favorable TripAdvisor reviews.

<Content>Boutique style Hotel with Parisien Panache This boutique hotel, while not cheap, was nevertheless very enjoyable. We were in Paris to celebrate a 40th birthday. The concierge booked us a great restaurant and even had them organise a cake! It is in a great location with many sights within walking distance of the hotel. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable with a cool, trendy interior. One tip though; ask for a room that overlooks the courtyard as the street side rooms are quite noisy at night.The chinoiserie is a great, albeit expensive place to chill out with a glass of champagne and a bite to eat after a hard day's sightseeing or shopping. Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Disappointing My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights at the beginning of October. 2 nights were free from our Gold Passport points and 3 nights were on our corporate rate plan. We received a room facing the courtyard which is expected given the corporate rate. The room was on the smallish side and the bed faced a weird direction (directly to the bathroom and door). Duvet was comfortable and bathroom amenities and the rainshower were good. HOWEVER, if you want to sleep in (past 7.30am) each morning (if you are on vacation you might want to), don't stay here because all the room doors close with a bang. We were woken up each morning with banging doors as our alarm clock. This however was not the major issue. Service at the hotel was poor. We requested reception/ concierge to help us book a restaurant for dinner. They confirmed the booking via a message to us. When we arrived at the restaurant, there was no booking. Then our room card key did not work for 3 days out of the 5 days we stayed there. The last draw came when we had to ask them to call a taxi for us to leave for the airport and then, we had to go out to find if our taxi had arrived and then go back into the hotel, pick up our luggage ourselves and bring out to the taxi. All the time, nobody offered any assistance. Service is very poor at a hotel of this class. I have stayed at many hotels due to business travels and the service at this one is one of the worst. The Hotel La Tremoille where we stayed last year was way better. I wonder if we would have been treated better if we had paid a more expensive rate. I will never know because I won't stay here anymore.

<Content>Very nice hotel A delightful hotel. The accommadations were well appointed, but the room (overlooking the courtyeard) was a bit small. Great bathroom with huge fluffy towels. The lobby restaurant was ideal for breakfast, but not cheap. Maid service was excellent. The concierge and front desk staff were very helpful. Location is good. Walking distance to a couple of very good restaurants and to Printemps and Galleries Lafayette.

<Content>Top class hotel in Paris I was lucky enough to stay in this hotel for three nights from 20th to 23rd August. I must admit that this hotel is top class. The staff are really friendly and helpful and spoke fluent english which was a help, although we did try to speak French to them on occasion!! We dined in the Chinoiserie every night of our stay and the food was fabulous. The one fault I would have is that the menu didn't change during our stay and whilst this was ok for us, for those on a longer vacation the menu could become quite tiresome. That said, what we ate every night was delicious and I would return for the Carre d'agneau and the piece de boeuf Charolais again and again. When I return to Paris I will also be returning to the Hyatt Regency Madeleine.

<Content>Thanks Tripadvisor Thanks to tripadvisor, I booked at the Hyatt Madeline. It is a beautiful hotel throughout. The room was perfect and seemed almost brand new. There is not a lot of activity at night, a quiet neighborhood.
