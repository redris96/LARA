<Content>WORST HOTEL EVER This hotel was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. The light in the bathroom didnt work and when we informed the front desk they did nothing, so we had no light for the whole stay. i would go as far as to say they ruined our trip. They sat us at a dirty table in an almost empty breakfast room and when my boyfriend moved the dirty cups the waiter (if you could call him that) swore at him.... We ended up walking out. We had to stay an extra night because we couldnt get anything else and they tried to charge us 100euros for the night even though i told them we were already staying there- so i got my sister to book it online and we got it for 58 euros. then they said we sould have told them we were staying there These were the most vile people I have ever met.The hotel itself was very very basic, we had read a review on here that said they were surprised it was a 2 star - we were also surprised, i wouldnt even give it 1 star. it was in a great location - but you couldnt pay me to stay there again.

<Content>Small ,family run hotel well located The hotel Giada is a little tricky to find simply because it has a small entrance and there is so many hotels in the back streets around the Medici palace. At night the area it is in is a little suspect, but having said that we never encountered any problems on our few days there.However, out front of the hotel is the home to the large Florence market, which means that through the night you can hear the market traders wheeling their stalls down the side streets. You wouldn't think this enough to wake you, but we were forced to move rooms because we couldn't sleep with the racket. Our original room was spacious and ornate and very clean. The room we moved to was much more cramped and modern, but at least we found a good nights sleep.The breakfast was very nice, with fresh food, but because its only a small hotel then there isn't much space in the breakfast room, and you have to get down there early. Breakfast was from 7am-10am and anybody who got there after 9.30am were lucky to get any food. At times the staff would be helpful, but at other times we felt like an inconvenience, mainl depended upon mood and which family member you happened to run into.

<Content>Amazing Location Hello, (Ciao)we stayed at the Hotel Giada for three days in June and it's in a great location, close to the train station (Santa Maria Novella), definitely within walking distance, across the street from San Lorenzo church (listen for the church bells.....great sound), and walking distance to Accademia, Ufittzi, Duomo and more....OK, OK, so the front desk people did not seem to want to be my best friend, but they were helpful and have free internet access....we stayed in a family quad room with bathroom right off the kitchen area....breakfast is rolls, juice, cheese salami, yogurt and fruit...good to get you going in the morning.....the room was air conditioned, and with the windows shut we never heard the street noise....street market is right out front and around the corner.....and as a side trip we hired a driver to take us to San Gimignano (about an hour away)...I don't think you could ask for a better location.

<Content>Happy Guest I was very pleased with the accommodation and service I received at this hotel. My room, inlcuding the bathroom were baseic but very clean. They hotel in provided real towels instead of those dish cloths you sometimes get in Italy. The hotel also provided a computer with free internet access and also allowed me to wait in the reception after I had checked out, before I walked to the train station.My only note of caution would be that the location is very noisy after the market closes between 8pm and 11pm and also in the morning when the stall owners are setting up, 7am to 9am.Otherwise i would say this was great value. I would stay again.

<Content>Do not fall in this hell because of the location The only convinient of this Hotel is the location, but believe me it is not worth it. Terrible service, terrible staff attitud and they did not help to find my cellphone. They ruined my staying in Florence. I am a traveler, I have been in so many hotels in the world and I have never seen such a terrible service. You can find other well located Hotels around.

<Content>Good location, Bad Staff The Hotel is located right in the historical center, next to S.Lorenzo Basilica, and this is definetely a plus. You will not need to catch any kind of public transport or cab, and the train station is just 300m from the hotel.The hotel is opposite S. Lorenzo market, so the street is quite messy all day long, but that is part of being in the city center.The room was clean, basic but quite comfortable, breakfast was ok. The hotel is at the first floor of an historical building, so to get to the reception you need to ring the bell and to go up to the first floor (and that's fine for me).I have been very disappointed by the staff, the owner and her man don't even say hi to you when you check in or out (and not in any other moment you might get in contact with them). Of course I was not expecting to become a close friend, but they are really too rude and this is not the way to behave with customers.Will I come back? Surely not.

<Content>Small but great This is a small hotel and hard to find. It is about a 5-10 minute walk from the train and bus stations. Don't think that a taxi will get you there. The hotel is in the middle of the market and no cars could get anywhere near the hotel. It is hard to find and up one floor. The room was small but adequate. I could not hear the vendors setting up their stalls. It probalby depends on the room you have. Several restaurants are nearby. Breakfast was buffet. Free internet is available to guests. I would recommend to peoople on a budget who are used to getting themselves around without the use of taxis. If you are a shopaholic, this is the place for you. It was raining when I arrived and some of the street vendors were huddled in the entranceway to the hotel. This could be a bit unnnerving to some people.

<Content>Great rooms The hotel looks slightly dodgy from the outside. However, do not be put off as the interior is quite new. The room is very large, much larger than I expected. The bathroom is spacious. The location is also very convenient to all attractions and the train station. There are 2 negatives: 1) there is a constant noise in the backgrouond, of people talking loudly, laughing, vehicles' engines running. 2) the breakfast is rather sad. the brewed coffee is bland. Bread is also stale.

<Content>Great room and location Our host must have been in a bad mood during our 2 night stay as we saw nothing of the friendly service most other people were talking about - most people seemed to be walking on egg shells around him! Anyway, it was a good thing we didn't come to Florence to make friends. The room was really good - nice, clean, spacious, with a newly renovated feeling. Airconditioned and breakfast included. Probably the best place we stayed in on our European trip. We didn't hear much noise from the market and felt very safe with the access controlled doors from the street. Location great. Only downside with our room was a phone in the lobby outside that was ringing late at night and woke us up. Otherwise would stay again.

<Content>Fantastic location! This hotel was booked primarily on the reviews! Thanks to all, we picked this fantastic place. The only thing that worried my family were the comments on the noise from the market. We (my husband,myself and our 2 teenage girls 16 and 17) experienced absolutely NO outside noise day or night!! We stayed in a quad room (#29) which faced the market. It is not pictured on the reviews, however, this room was huge! We had plenty of room! The location is fantastic. We were able to walk from the train station and back with 9...yes...9 pieces of luggage and we managed quite well...with the exception of a few people laughing at us! Trust me....the shopping in Florence is the BEST!!! Just a quick other note...Take bus 12 or 13 to see great sites of Florence without paying the price of a tour....you can get off at any of the tourist places...then just hop back onto one of the same buses to take you back to the main train station! oops...one other thing...across the road from the train station is a tourist info centre...they don't charge for city maps and they will plan out very good map of all the places to see!!!

<Content>Great location and Excellent Staff! We looked and looked for a BB and finally decided on Giada. The hotel is in a great location. Everything is in short walking distance (even though it looks far on a map - it is truly very very close). Statue of David is 4 blocks away, Duomo is 2 blocks, train station is 2 - 3 blocks, Ponte Vecchio is a 7 minute walk approx (much to see and shop along the way). The staff are wonderful! They helped me set up my laptop, which I am not savvy on at all. Oh yes, did I mention the free WI FI and use of their lobby computer. The room is what I expected and the continental breakfast is perfect. Options of croissants, buns, cereal, ham/cheese panini and coffees (cappuccinos, espresso, regular coffee, etc.) They have affordable beverages on hand in the breakfast room. If it rains, which it has on our stay, complimentary umbrellas.The bathroom is what I expect in Europe. It is smaller than what we would get in the States and it does the job. :)Also, it is secure and quiet. The double paned windows work great. I know some have mentioned the noise from the market, but I look at it like this, if you don't plan on sleeping in beyond 8:30am - 9:00am, you will be fine. It won't be the noise from the market necessarily waking you, it would be the church bells at this time.Take advise on the recommended restaurants from the staff!I would highly recommend staying here.

<Content>Good Experience My husband and I really enjoyed our time at the Hotel Giada. We were able to leave our bags there in the morning and tour around Florence. The room was clean and the shower was hot. This was all we wanted from a hotel. Breakfast was solid but small. The location was perfect, across the street from the Medici Chapel, in the middle of the San Lorenzo market, and five minutes from the Duomo. We had a room at the front of the hotel and we could not hear a single thing from the market below.Good experience and a nice place.

<Content>Great little hotel We have just returned from a week in Florence. The hotel was excellent for our requirements, clean, good continental breakfast with cheese, ham, cereals and lovely fresh bread and croissants. We were located in a central room on the first floor and experienced no noise from outside as mentioned in some reviews. The owners appear to be working hard to update many facilities in the hotel but this work did not create any problems. A great central location only short walks to reach all the major sites, The Duomo, Ponte Vechio bridge and Uffizi. Terrific choice of eating places, again all within easy walking distance. We found the staff approachable and although no bar, it was still possible to buy a beer or soft drink from the hotel reception after a long day sightseeing. We will definitely return.

<Content>A nice Hotel, but a couple of problems I stayed at the Giada for 4 nights in September 2006.A very nice Hotel, very comfortable, with a good bathroom.However, I would describe the Hotel as a bit antiseptic. It was cold and uninviting not a friendly warm Hotel where the staff became involved with the guests welfare. The staff were not overly friendly and the Hotel sometimes even smelled a bit of antiseptic. The famous San Lorenzo markets are in the same street as the Hotel making the Hotel a bit hard to find. I was really looking forward to seeing the markets and walking through them each time I left the Hotel. However, that was not to be the case. I found the markets to be a real inconvience and a dammed nuisence. They were extremely noisy and had nothing but junk. Most of the traders were north Africans who peddled leather goods and rubbish. There was absolutely nothing Italian about these markets at all. If you are looking for a real Italian market experience, you will be very disappointed..They started early in the morning and did not clear away until about 9-00pm at night. During this time the noise level was extreme and sometimes the noise continued on into the small hours of the morning, with the younger traders playing football and generally making a lot of noise. This did affect sleeping and it is a problem for this Hotel.The presence of the markets also made it impossible to see and photograph the old Medici chapels over the road from the Hotel.I would definately not go so far as to tell people not to stay at the Hotel. If the staff had been a bit more friendly and the markets had not been there I would have described the Hotel as excellent.It is very close to some wonderful restaurants and most importantly, it is within walking distance of the main Railway Station to enable you to drag your luggage there instead of getting a taxi. I would guess the distance to be about 400 meters.

<Content>Did not like it at all The room smelled of urine from the second night I was there. There were flies in the room. The man at the front desk is very very unfriendly. Made me wonder if I had offended him in some way. It is extremely difficult to find during the day when the market is in operation. The only plus was the decent breakfast. If I ever go to Florence again I would spend money on a more expensive hotel

<Content>Nice little hotel! I am pretty shocked at some of the earlier comments. Cars can't get there? Tiny elevators? No view? Well, this is a 2* hotel that's in the center of Florence, right across from the Medici Chapel. I think some people may not understand the geography of the city, and have unreasonable expectations.The rooms are of all different size. There were three adults in my party, so we had a pretty large room that they could also use for a quad. The hallways and public area are well decorated, while our room is just so so. Our key card worked all the time, and I didn't find any security problem during our two-night stay. Felt totally safe.Some people mentioned noise. If you're sensitive to noise, then Giada is not for you. You'll hear the merchant carts on San Lorenzo being pulled through the street every morning and evening. Maybe better when the A/C is on, which masked the noise, but you probably could still hear it.Also, while the lady owner is very nice and sweet, the husband doesn't like to talk much. He did a good job setting the breakfast every morning; and he also came to fix our heat the first evening. But he's not the type that smiles all the time, neither will he say Hi often. You may want to know about that.The price, the room, the location, the breakfast are all very satisfactory. I had some worries before my arrival, but I can heartily recommend it to anybody who can tolerate some noise from outside.

<Content>Hotel Giada I stayed at the Hotel Giada for eight nights. I enjoyed my expereince and would stay there again. The breakfast is great, especially if you compare it to what you normally get in Europe. Here you have yogurt, cereals, breads, hard-boiled eggs, ham and cheese, and great coffee or tea. It is true that the rooms can be dark and are outfitted in older bedding, but I found them to be clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are small but clean. Each room has a safe, fridge, and TV. The staff is really nice and helpful, and work to make sure that you are having a good stay at the hotel and in Florence. Free use of the internet in the lobby is also really nice. The hotel is right in the middle of the markets, which are great and pack up in the evening so the streets are quiet. You can easily walk to and from the train station (5min walk) and everything else for that matter. Clearly this hotel is not a five star hotel, but it is a great two star! If you are the type that is never happy and really hard to please don't stay here stay at a five star hotel.

<Content>Hotel Giada ...Not very friendly Ok, this is the story. My husband and I stayed in the Hotel Giada for just one night and that was enough. First of all, they happen to have the worst staff members ever, they're not nice at all. The were rude, and we never heard the words thank you your welcome or a simple Have a nice trip. I'm sure they are always booked because it's well located, but that's it. The room was very dark, had a weird smell and the funny part is that the room had just a little window facing a wall and the bathroom uncomfortable, like very old and breaking apart. I bet there are some better places to stay in Florence.

<Content>I'm sorry to say you shouldn't stay.... Description:I think the two folks who own the Giada (Eva  husband) are lovely, but I would never stay there again and do not reccomend it.Giada is in the middle of the markets, about 5 blocks from the train station. Cabs cannot go there, so you have to lug your stuff either over cobbble streets while dodging trucks and scooters or on the narrow sloping sidewalks, where no native will give you an inch to walk. It was difficult. The room appears very clean, but is furnished thrift-store style. We found a tick on the wall, and I got flea bites all around my ankles.The shower is a 1.5 foot box that you have to squeeze into through a tiny opening in the corner (tight, even for my size 4 mama). The toilet runs spontaneously. The TV has no CNN or BBC, so no English programs. The big American breakfast is runny yougurt, warm sour juice, horrible croissants, fruit, Kraft American singles, and hard boiled eggs  coffee  tea. /no iron available, and none allowed to be used in the hotel. The reception is closed from 11-7, so you cannot get a wake-up call, (we had to sit up all night to make sure we caught our 6 am train to Rome), and the security is extreme (locking hallways, video camaras everywhere), faulty (swipe cards that work occasionally, scary after the staff goes home), and sketchy (locked hallways left wide open at times). The elevator fits 1 person and a suitcase. The markets that surround it are not little gems, just extensions of the area stores, and they all hawk the same things. Boring. No originality. The outside street can smell, at times, of sewage. Barely a window in the room, with no view. Fridge in the room, but not very cold. Nothing in it to purchase. Hairdryer they provide does not work. Rooms are not bright, although, I believe, they are painted yellow. Hotel is hard to spot when the markets are open, as are street signs in Florence, which can leave you wandering the streets. Staff has limited English.Unique Qualities:Staff is either Eva or her husband, and they are sweet great people. They have free internet while the lobby is open, but it will not access some American email providers I found out. They will make you tea during the times they are there if you'd like. They have lots of maps, dictionaries, and umbrellas in the reception, which they will let you use.Breakfast is free, and if you can eat anything just to fill your belly you may find it adequate.AC in the room works and works great, but boy is it loud. It sounds like a heavy rainstorm pelting down.Comparative Price: about averagePrices: US$120-180Type: Bed and BreakfastAddress: Canto De Nelli 2Directions:Across from the ugly church behind the leather coat stand. Which leather coat stand? When you find the bricked-up church window w/ the crumbling bricks (lots of its windows are bricked-up; it must be the crumbly one) across the street from that is Giada.Phone: -----

<Content>I was cheated When I walked in and asked for a room, the staff showed me a very nice room on the 2nd floor. After I agreed to stay there for 5 nights, he told me he has to move me to another room after the 1st night. I agreed only to find the 2nd room they offered was much smaller -- about half of the size of the 1st room. I didn't feel like looking for another hotel so I stayed. But I certainly would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Warm and Friendly Hotel My family just returned from a wonderful trip to Italy. There were nine of us staying at the Hotel Giada. The owners, Eva and Antonio were unbelievably friendly and so accommodating. They helped us arrange a tour to Siena and San Gimignano - one we would all highly recommend. They also recommended two different restaurants close by...one was better than the next. The bustling San Lorenzo market is right outside the Hotel, but we didn't hear any street noise from inside the hotel. The breakfast room was cozy and the food good. Great value for the price. We will certainly return! Our experience at the Hotel Giada was superior to our experience earlier in the week at a 4-star Hotel in Rome.

<Content>LIfe, not noise! As has been said by many reviewers, the Giada is very centrally located and great value for money. I can't agree with what many people have said about the noise in the surrounding area though. Yes, it can be very noisy but what many regard as noise I think I choose to see as LIFE! If you want undisturbed peace and tranquillity (and sometimes I do too) then don't take a break in the middle of an Italian city. All I have ever visited are buzzing, vibrant, lively, and in places cacophonic - that's part of what makes them Italian.Florence is a fabulous city, I can't wait to go back, and if you do need some quiet, try the Boboli gardens.

<Content>I recommend Hotel Giada, but... I stayed at Hotel Giada from October 11-15, 2005, and I definitely recommend this hotel. However, I feel that I have to give one suggestion - invest in earplugs or request a room in the back away from the street. The hotel is in the heart of the San Lorenzo market, which makes it a little difficult to find during the day, but, for the most part, the location is excellent; very easy to find from the train station and is within walking distance to many top sites. The market vendors start to pack things up around 8 p.m. or so, which includes the hauling of their carts down the street which creates a great deal of noise and then the city workers come in with their sweeper trucks, again creating a great deal of noise. Then, the vendors start to set up very early in the morning. I am a very sound sleeper, but I did find it difficult to fall asleep most of the time I was there.However, the hotel itself and rooms were very clean. I had a single room, so it was smaller than I expected, but there was plenty of room for one (besides, when in Italy who wants to hang out in their hotel all day!). The two gentlemen that run the hotel are fantastic. They are young, fun and are more than willing to answer any questions you may have.All in all, if you are looking for a hotel that is extremely reasonably priced, clean, in close proximity to public transportation and in an area that even a single gal felt safe in, then Hotel Giada is for you. Just keep in mind that it isn't going to be the Hilton or Plaza, and you will enjoy your stay. AND REMEMBER THE EARPLUGS!!!!

<Content>Great deal in the heart of it all. We stayed here based on reviews. I must say I was surprised with the Giada. I see people griping about what they got for their money....if you want to stay in a 5 star hotel then do it. This place was great, and a bargain at 85 Euro. Breakfast was good.(cold cereal, yogart, ham, hard boiled eggs). It depends on what side of the hotel you stay on (to try and avoid the noise of the people setting up and taking down the carts for the leather outside flea mall). We stayed right off the Breakfast room and had no noise at all. The room was decent, clean sheets, no bed bugs, like I read about in some other places. The shower was tight....but it is typical of Europe. I would stay here again if I ever go back to Florence. Couple of other things I will add for those going to Florence and stay here, Great location, Walking distance to all. right outside the front door to the left....great Gelato!(and this is the alley the guys go up and down with the carts, keep that in mind when getting your room), keep going down the alleyway and than it opens to 4 or 5 restaurants, (we found the first one to have very tasty pizza and food) then to the left there is a true Irish bar for those of us who need a beer and not a wine. Murphys stout on hand here!! But the guy at the bar did give us red wine to try and it was the best I had while in Italy....but I am a beer guy not a wine guy. Rome was next stop for us and for 140 euro a night this place seemed like a dream. Hope this helps some of you, and good luck.

<Content>Didn't really like it We stayed 3 nights and had a back room, so we didn't find it noisy.There is a key-controlled lift used by the hotel to carry luggage up to your floor, but you have to walk. Our double was on the 2nd floor (3rd), but with 22 steps between floors, it felt as if we were walking up to the 4th. Everything worked including the A/C, and for the central location I guess 85 euros with in-room shower in September is a good deal, Still I would not stay there again. In addition our room was at the end of a corridor with only one way out. I normally don't worry about these things, but had there been a fire...Pros: Generous breakfast.Cons: No elevator, above safety consideration

<Content>Excellent Location Had a lovely stay at the Giada in July 2005. Excellent location - walking distance from train - and walking distance to Duomo (just a block away really), Ponte Vecchio (sp?) etc. Stayed in 4 bed room just off breakfast room and above the markets, but thanks to the excellent double glazed windows, and double door, slept very soundly; it was very quiet. The (buffet) breakfast is very good in a charming room looking over at the Medici bells. Having a fridge in the room was good because it can get very hot in July. Air conditioning also worked well, but was a little noisy. Bathroom was small but clean and new fittings. Seemed to have good security (key card to get in to building). Recommended for location and value for money.

<Content>A bit too noisy! It is a small and old hotel with a beautiful location in the heart of Florence.Our room was big and had all the amenities promised, although the furniture just looked old.What you have to keep in mind if you choose this hotel is that rooms facing the via Canto d猫 Nelli and the adjacent square are very moisy: market stalls start arriving as early as 5 a.m. and will wake you up with their noisy wheels and the cries of their owners. However it is a good value for money.

<Content>Noisy at night..... Small hotel right in the heart of Florence. Rooms are clean and a good size, breakfast is adequate, but location is quite noisy at night. The main Florence market is at the front door which starts quite early in the morning and an alley way running down the side of the hotel outside our room which mean it was noisy all night.

<Content>Very nice clean, and excellent cofe We stayed at the Hotel Giada for three days and liked it very much. The owners are very nice and they make you feel right at home. Its a beautiful hotel, very clean. The hotel is extremely close to the main tourist attractions. We had access to the internet in the lobby. The breakfast room was very big with two windows overlook the Medicee Chapels, and the assortment of cold cereals, rolls and croissants, ham, juices, and wrapped baked goods made a substantial meal. The Caf茅 was excellent like we have at home. Will definitely come back.. Highly recommended!

<Content>Very nice hotel, great location and friendly owner We had a wonderful 3 nights stay at the hotel Giada, , we had one double very large, with the nice bathroom. The location is fabulous within walking distance of all the key attractions and the staff are very charming and helpful. Very substantial breakfast with meat, cheese, cappucino and everything else you would expect from an expanded Continental Breakfast. Very good internet access. Best of all was the friendly and helpful service from Eva who made reservations for us at the museums.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, friendly, great location Just returned from our first short visit to Florence. Great place. We will definitely go back and will definitely choose the Hotel Giada for it's great location (less than 10 minutes walk from the main train station where the airport shuttle bus from Pisa stops), friendly owners, more than adequate cold buffet breakfast, air-conditioning, lift and free internet access. We like to go out in the morning and return to the hotel after our evening meal. When you spend such a short time in a hotel room you don't need all the comforts of home. The shower was powerful and hot. There is a bustling market right outside the front door. Our room was at the rear of the hotel so no street noise at all. Watch out for pickpockets, particularly when getting on the Citysightseeing tour bus at the Duomo which is again only a few minutes walk from the Hotel Giada. I agree that this hotel deserves a 3 star rating.

<Content>Fantastic Value and Location The hotel should really be a three star. The location is very nice, very central. The rooms are spotless and well equipped with nice linens and good air-conditioning. The staff is very helpful. Breakfast is good. I've stayed in over 50 hotels in Italy, Spain and the UK, in the last two months, all three or four stars and I would say this one is at par or better than many of the others I've visited.

<Content>Great Stay We recently took our vacation over in Europe, first time in 13 years. We went with our 2 children and travelled by plane and train around the country. Our first stop was in Florence, awesome city. We stayed at the Hotel Giada, Eva and her husband, Sergio, the owners of a really great gem. We read prior reviews of MANY other hotels all over the country, prior to booking. Yes, we really took a shot in the dark when we reached all of hotel choices, but we were pleasantly surprised and very happy in the end with all of our choices. We thank you for your service of providing the everyday person feedback to their choice of hotels. The Hotel Giada was really fabulous, with both Eva and Sergio being absolutely lovely people, who knew how to treat a new visitor to their country. We can't say enough about them and their hotel, except, Thank You!!! For being the nicest, hospitable, comforting, genuine people we've ever met. We also can't thank you both enough for the warmth you provided our 2 boys during their stay. The room, off the breakfast area was very quiet, the street noise non-existent, and location a perfect gem!!! We also will recommend all of friends as well... We'll definitely come back and stay at the Hotel Giada again and thank you to Eva and Sergio for making this an awesome start of our vacation!!!!

<Content>Convenient and good service, but my wife says we won't stay there again The location is okay. It is convenient to all of the key sites in Florence: everything is within a 20-minute stroll. However, it is located in the midst of the leather market, so you must walk through stalls to get to the hotel entrance. It also means that some rooms must hear the maneuvering of carts beginning at 5 in the morning (request a room that is not on the street).The staff is helpful and the breakfast is ample. The lobby even has a PC that allows you to surf the Internet. It is a very nice thing to have, but to set expectations, it is Windows 98 and the connection is not superfast. Another positive is the elevator.The room in which we stayed (#23) is large and clean. The TV has CNN-World and BBC that allows you to catch up on world news. However, the corkboard wall panelling and the flourescent lighting is not very attractiveAll-in-all, the hotel is nice, but the room did not provide the quiet refuge we needed after fighting the tourists and traffic of the streets in Florence. But, after looking at all of the other hotels in the area (Giada looks much better), we think it is a better idea to stay outside of the city.

<Content>Good Breakfast, Clean, Nice People This is now our fourth hotel in Florence in the past two weeks. Weve stayed in four, three, and two stars. Giada should be way more than two stars. The woman who owns the hotel is so sweet, the breakfast is delicious, and the rooms/bathroom very spacious and clean. The location is perfect for travelers who want to be in the heart of Florences action. It is right outside San Lorenzo open air market....very fun. LOVE THIS PLACE!!

<Content>A lovely hotel I incidently booked this small hotel in the last minutes after the original one I booked couldn't provide me a room. So I had to pay 60euro per night to stay in a double room though I perfer a single one. The hotel is about 150 meters from either the main train station or Duomo. It just locates beside the Medici Champel where a street market is just under the window of my room. Surprisely, it's very quiet during the night after the merchants leave the street at about 7pm. The clean room is large and cosy. The shower room is very nice and operational. They do have a TV with CNN, the only english channel from satellite. I met two hotel receptionists during my 3-day stay in Florence. One of them can speak very good english. He helped me a lot during my stay. Though the other is also polite enough to be a worker in the hotel, I found it is a little bit more difficult to get help from him.

<Content>Great hotel, go for it...!!! I saw the website of the hotel and immediately fell in love with it. The location is perfect, it is just behind the Medici Chapels, 5 minutes walk from the Duomo and 7-8 minutes from Santa Maria Novella Train Station...The room is very sweet, very clean, the shower works excellently. It is also quiet. The breakfast is excellent, they serve all coffees, eggs, croissants, cheese and ham as well as cereals and milk. I was very impressed. There is another asset that this hotel has: You can open the main door (entrance of the main building) with a card key, also the 2nd floor door. Therefore it is very safe...I was a single traveler, for me this was an excellent value. Eva, the owner is also very sweet, she takes care of everything herself. I paid 45 EUR for a single room paid cash in December. Compared to the value, it is simply EXCELLENT... Go for it, no doubt, but the hotel fills up quickly, so don't be a last minute for reserving it...

<Content>Great location! Free internet!!! We stayed here the first of October and had a great time. The hotel is close to the train station and above a fantastic market place. The hotel is pretty average with a big room and small bathroom, pretty standard. The breakfast is decent. What makes this hotel great is the free internet you get (there is a computer you can use by the front desk up until 11pm) and the location.

<Content>Adequate Hotel Giada is a very basic hotel. Clean and comfortable-perfect for the budget minded traveler. The staff was generally helpful with information and making reservations to Uffizi etc. Only complaint was that the shower was quite small. Breakfast was continental style with eggs and cold cuts. Situated right across the street from San Lorenzo, it is within walking distance of all the major sites and the train station. Lots of little cafes and restaurants close-by and the leather market is literally right on your doorstep!

<Content>Good Value Hotel Giada is centrally located; 5 min walk from the train station and within walking distance of most of the sites. The room that we stayed in was simple and clean, but the bathroom was tiny. The staff is very helpful and friendly. I would recommend Giada to anyone traveling on a budget.

<Content>Heart of Florence While in Europe this summer, I stayed in hotel Giada in July. It was nice. It was not romantic. This is a typical budget hotel, similar to best western standards. Hot shower, toliet, bidet, big bed and big sink. Tiled floors. the rooms were old, which is expected. Safe hotel. They give you a card key so you can come and go. They have internet for free. Breakfast cereal coco and regualr flakes, eggs, cheese and meat. We did not get a taxi to the hotel. We walked. Literally across the street to the right. Walked with 6 luggage bags. no problem. becuase there is so much to see, we were never in our room. However, it is not romantic, no view. But who cares, is was clean and A/C cold.walking distance to everything... and right behind the flea market.
