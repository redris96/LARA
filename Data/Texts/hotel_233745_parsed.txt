<Content>Quality excellence Having found the hotel on tripadvisor.com i hunted around for a deal and found the best offer on the hotel website.We stayed in Theodore De Banville which was a good size room with a high standard of decoration and facilities (no kettle though!!)we couldn't fault the hotel or staff at all it was all very good. only complaints would be the VERY high bar cost, 拢10 for single whiskey etc

<Content>Chic and Intimate hotel We had a great two nights in the Hotel de Banville. It is fun, fashionable and friendly with a relaxed, intimate atmosphere. Our room was a little small but beautifully presented so the size really wasn't much of an issue. It was well located and there was secure parking close by. Breakfast was simple and served in the lobby. My husband felt the lobby might be trying to do too much accommodating breakfast each morning but I felt it was fine. We would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Unforgettable!! Unforgettable sums up our stay completely in this most beautiful Paris hotel. Other words I would use would include, tranquil, perfect, relaxing, stunning... I could go on but I believe that you are getting my point.I booked this hotel directly for my partners 25th birthday as a surprise. I got everything and more that I asked for which is the way I believe it should be. We booked the Amelie room - which in itself was a particular treat - with beautiful decoration, a stunning bathroom and the most spectacular view of the Eiffel Tower from the balcony. You can even catch a view of the top of the Arc de Triumph and other monuments if you have a beady eye. There was little noise from the hotel or the surrounding area, which made this stay very peaceful. In addition, I found the hotel staff to be fantastic. In particular, Blerina - here is a personal thank you to you - you helped make my partner鈥檚 birthday sublime by helping organise champagne and birthday decorations for our room - this was the cherry on top for our stay!! I truly believe that I could write an essay about just how magnificent this hotel was, the staff, and the room the location, but I appreciate that there is not time. What I will end with is that if you are planning a trip to Paris, and you want to do things the Paris way (luxury, beauty) - this hotel is the place to be!

<Content>A hidden gem and should be in any top 10 of Paris hotels Having looked at, no joke, over 50 hotels in Paris i was delighted to come accross Hotel De Banville. Trying to find a great hotel for less than 鈧?00 a night which has a true Parisian feel to it was no easy task. Hotel De Banville is everything I wanted. fantastically individual rooms, beautiful bathrooms - some open plan to the room with the curtain dividers which I loved. The staff were fantastic and even remained patient when I kept changing my mind over which room to book as i wanted to make sure it was perfect. We stayed in one of the Prelude rooms which was perfect. It's in a great location close to Montmartre which is one of my favourite places in Paris and is so close via the metro to anywhere in paris. And only 10 mins in a cab from Gare du Nord. I can't say enough about this hotel - at many other hotels you'd be paying 鈧?00 a night for a name and a room and experience of half the quality.

<Content>Great hotel for a weekend in Paris Went to Paris for D' Arc horse races and booked Hotel de Banville by accident as this was nearby the hotel where our friends were staying. Very pleasant surprise. Feeling of a classic modern boutique hotel with great service, newly renovated rooms with bed rooms in a classic style and bathrooms super modern, nice breakfast and very private. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a romantic weekend in Paris!

<Content>Fantastic hotel, very friendly staff We booked a double room through Airmiles for a long weekend to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. I was impressed from the second we walked in through the doors. The foyer was small but beautifully presented and, more importantly, clean. Checking was easy, we were given a map with the hotel and nearest metro station clearly marked on it. Our room was on the 5th floor, we rode up in the smallest lift I've ever been in but that just made us smile. Our room was very clean and light, the bathroom was cleaner than some hotels I've been in and the power shower was exactly that unlike most hotel showers!!Our booking included breakfast which was served in the lobby or you could have it in your room. There was ample food available and the staff didn't look surprised when I ordered an omelette instead of eating croissants etc with my husband (I have a wheat allergy) and it was a far nicer omelette than I can make myself!!In short, great hotel, comfortable bed and friendly staff, I swear they had a bell attached to the front doors so they could greet you just as you had one foot in the building. Can't wait to book our next stay.

<Content>Wonderful De Banville We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the de Banville to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. Everything already written on these pages about the hotel is spot-on. I am a Travel Agent and have stayed in many hotels but this hotel is one of the best.In a nice quiet residential area of Paris with some great restaurants close by (try San Remo's if you like Italian) and a pleasant 15 minute walk to the Arc de Tromphie.We stayed in the Ameile room. The room was very cosy with a lovely claw-foot bath to relax in after a full day visiting the sights. We also had a great view of the Eiffel Tower/Arc de Tromphie and a small balcony with table  chairs where we ate breakfast one morning. What more can one ask for! As a bonus at night, you get the chance to sit on the balcony and watch the Eiffel Tower's spectacular light show.The staff were extremley polite and helpful and spoke fluent English and the service was excellent. We requested a private car transfer from Gare de l'Est which the hotel provided for 25 Euros. Well worth doing to save queing for a taxi especially at 10pm at night. The driver was so helpful and polite and on our return to the Gare Du Nord to catch the Eurostar he even took our luggage all the way up to the check-in.Breakfast was also very good (croissants, cold meats etc.) and kept one going until a lunch-time snack.We can't wait to return again and stay in the lovely Ameile room.Tip For Sightseeing: Use L'Open Bus Tour. Bus stop near Arc de Tromphie. 4 routes, jump on/off at any stop and includes boat that runs up/down the Seine. Great way to see Paris and all the sights.

<Content>All that we had hoped for ...and more! We booked a two night stay at the Hotel for my 4th July birthday back in March. I had read up on many reviews on Trip Advisor adn knew we were in for a treat! The hotel exceeded our expectations!Our driver was late coming to collect us at the airport (we think he forgot us) but the hotel were very apologetic , as was the driver! When we arrived , the first thing I was greeted with was a 'Happy Birthday and told to enjoy some champagne on behalf o fthe hotel which was very nice!Our room, L'apartment de Marie was ready for us on arrival and it is such a beautiful Paris room, up on the 8th floor with such a fantastic view of the tower, the arc de triomphe and even sacre couer in the distance! Every member of staff were so friendly, helpful, approachable, always smiling and asking how you were! I dealt with Alexandre on reception in many e-mails and she was wonderful. Our favorites about the hotel would be the turn down service of the bed in evening, when they left the bedside lamps on low lighting with little chocs on pillow. Breakfast brought to room in morning! Lots of little extras in room, good magazines and Paris books, plenty of soaps, shampoos replaced every day! My boyfriend loved that the stocked the Guardian newspaper every day too! Overall service was top class!We expected the hotel to be in a nice location, but a little away from the main attractions,in reality it is much closer than we thought! The Arc de Triomphe is honestly only a 15 min max walk from hotel (a lovely walk), we strolled home from Dinner beside Tuilleries gardens one night and it took max 35 mins, again a lovely walk through Paris! Pack your comfy shoes and enjoy strolling through the streets. Area hotel is in is gorgeous, lots of nice brasseries on Perreire roundabout down the street, buzzes with Parisian charm!I agree with one other reviewer that I don't want to tell too many people about this place in case it becomes too busy and loses its charm!!!!! We will most definitely be back to the Hotel de Banville!

<Content>Lovely boutique Hotel Had a short stay here. The location is better if you have been to Paris before. For a first time traveller to Paris it is probably a bit far away from the main tourist sites. Having said that it is only a 15 minute metro ride into the main tourist sites.The staff we came across were very nice and helpful.Our room was on the top floor with a fantastic view of Paris including the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower!

<Content>Great Service at deBanville My wife and I recently stayed 6 nights at hotel deBanville (both planned and unplanned nights). Our intent was to celebrate her 60th birthday with 5 days in Paris then move on for a week in Provence. Unfortunately our trip got off to a rocky start as a result of various missed flight connections then with my wife contracting sometype of intestional bug which caused us to cancel the last half of the trip. Throughout our difficulties, the staff at the hotel was both sympathetic and most cooperative in tracking lost luggage, securing medical assistance and making sure we could stay additional nights at the hotel until we could arrange for an early flight home.During our stay I noticed that the staffing levels were quite high for a relatively small hotel (less than 40 rooms). This resulted in a high level of personal service. Also when we first made our reservations I noticed that the manager responded to all complaints posted on this site. He may not have been able to resolve every complaint but his public efforts in this regard influenced our decision to stay at the de Banville. The hotel is located in a residential neighbhorhood that was fun to explore. A metro stop is close by and you can be at most of the major sites within 15-20 minutes. Say hello to the staff for me when you visit the hotel. Regards Bob Howse

<Content>Great stay at the Hotel De Banville Had a three night stay at this hotel and enjoyed every minute of it. The staff were very friendly, (excellent english, which is great when your French ain't up to scratch!).Room was nice and clean. We didn't have a bath in our particular room which disappointed me a little. But when I did give the shower a go, it was just amazing! Nice powerful shower and hot water whenever you want it, which meets my criteria for a shower!Small bathroom but nicely decorated and nice little extras such as shampoo, shower gel , cotton buds etc. I had asked for a bottle of champagne to be in our room on arrival(as it was my boyfriends birthday) and they kindly obliged, even adding a few bowls of nice niblies!The hotel itself is a little away from the main centre of paris, but right next to a metro which can take you anywhere you want to go.We had breakfast included during our stay and it was spot on. Selection of cereals, breads, eggs, fruit, teas coffees. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to experience paris in fun, luxurious and clean environment.

<Content>A real Gem! We really loved it! My husband booked a 4 day break at the beginning of April for my 40th birthday. We had used Trip Advisor to choose this hotel and booked via AirMiles. I should say straight away that we are fussy. I hate dirt, unkemptness etc and was apprehensive about going. I really needn't have been as this hotel is absolutely marvellous. I can't recommend this strongly enough. We stayed in the Prelude room for a supplement per night. The room and the hotel is clean, romantic and has a certain elegance which brings a special air to any special occasion. The main foyer/bar area is lovely and has a real touch of class. Unfortunately, my husband fell as we walked around Paris on our first day. This gave us lots of opportunity to use all the hotel's facilities as I nursed him before travelling home on the 4th day. Room service (breakfast, lunch and dinner) was great, dry cleaning is prompt and done well, there is access to the internet in the main lobby, the rooms are clean, well decorated and appointed with everything one could need, but the real praise must go to the owner of this family run business and her handpicked staff. Each member of staff no matter what their job (both daytime and night-time staff) treated us like members of the family and did all they could to help us and offer us a special stay. This really did feel like a home from home and with my husband so poorly, this was really welcome. We had a taxi (arranged by the hotel before arrival from CDG to the hotel). The driver is lovely and helped us greatly. If you are looking for a hotel with style, class, elegance and romance, where every personal touch and attention to detail is given to your stay, then this is the one. The metro and local buses are within close walking distance and the area is lovely and exactly what I expected from a holiday in Paris.Would we return? Most definitely.

<Content>Relaxing weekend break Booked the Hotel de Banville via AirMiles after good reviews. Arrived at the hotel to find that the booking had not been received! Luckily they had rooms available and the staff were very helpful in sorting this out. We were allocated a room on the back of the hotel, which initially looked small and a little dark. However, on further inspection the furnishings were of very high quality and everything was immaculately clean. The bathroom was again small, but well furnished, with a lovely powerful shower. A quick look into other rooms while they were being cleaned showed they are all differently decorated and furnished, but of a similar size.The staff were all very helpful and friendly, and you could take breakfast in your room at no extra cost - lovely!The hotel is out of the main tourist areas, being about 15 mins walk to the Arc de Triumphe and Trocadero. However, it was peaceful and quiet, with a Metro and RER stop very close by.Despite the initial hitch, I would highly recommend this hotel - however, I would ask for a room on the front - they were brighter.

<Content>Everything GREAT We stayed it this hotel for 2 nights in the room Marie, 8th floor. Once you have accepted the generally high prices for hotels in Paris, then there is nothing negative to say about this hotel. Au contraire: it's great!Very friendly hotel staff. Super clean rooms.Good food (try have breakfast in the room with view on the Eiffel tower!)Themed rooms (every room seems to be different), great decor.Good location (100m to the metro, 20min to the train station nord/est)The only negative thing would be the very slow lift....but does that really matter?Anyway, try to get a room on the upper floor, street side. And there is one room (Am茅lie?) which has a baclony and Tour Eiffel view for unforgettable breakfasts)If I am in Paris again, I know where I will stay.

<Content>A splendid stay We have just returned from a 2 night stay in Paris and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. We were given an extremely warm and friendly welcome on arrival and were really pleased with our room. We stayed in a superior room - and the views from the balcony were simply stunning. To our delight, we had a fantastic uninterrupted view of the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe and the Sacre Coeur over the Parisian rooftops. The weather was fantastic and the sun streamed into the room. The room was extremely clean, quiet and comfortable and there was a fabulous roll top bath to lie back in whilst admiring the Eiffel Tower shimmering in the evening sky. Every single member of staff we met was so friendly and helpful, which in itself would encourage us to return and stay there again.The hotel is ideally situated for both the metro and RER and we got about Paris with ease. The hotel is in a nice area and there are a great range of restaurants/shops nearby - we particularly loved the restaurant du 17eme in the Place Pereire. Overall, an extremely enjoyable stay and we were sorry to be leaving. We would recommend this hotel to absolutely everyone.

<Content>Beautifully quaint hotel with exceptionally friendly staff Booked this trip as a romantic getaway for the last weekend before Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. Arrival at the hotel was slightly later than intended due to a 1.5 hour delay on the Eurostar and a long wait for a taxi at Gare du Nord but the welcome was extremely warm on arrival. Lift up to our room could only be described as cosy but it served it's purpose none the less. Room was beautifully and tastefully decorated and exactly what I hoped for when I initially booked the trip. Breakfast the next morning was adequate enough for us to fill up on before our exploration of the city - comprised of various pastries, cold meats  cheeses. The reception staff were extremely helpful throughout and spoke perfect English....which was very handy as my attempt at broken French was struggling to say the least!!! Didn't use the Metro but there is a stop about 100 yards away. A walk down to Champs Elysee took around 20 minutes.

This is a charming property, loved the design, rooms are very clean and comfortable. Continental breakfast was not exceptional but well above standards.

<Content>Ruined our engagment trip This review is dedicated to Thierry, the receptionist at this hotel.It has to be one of my worst hotel experience in memory: It went down hill right from check in. Very indifferent and arrogant. They made us feel marginalized like Afro-Americans in the 1950's. Remarkably, the room it self was lovely...We stayed in the Theodore de Banville room. Nice view...Very tastefully decorated, but a littel dated looking. Anyhow, the negative certainly overshadowed the positive very quickly when we discovered they told us we will lose the room the second night.( This is after confirming our booking directly with the hotel while we were in Toronto ). The second room was very frumpy and dated looking..rather tired. In each room, there was a bowl of fruit that looked like they were picked out of a garbage bin...beyond rotten...actually petrifying. I asked front desk to please remove the disgusting sight. They grudgingly did that, but later charged us for fruit and mineral water on our bill when we checked out. Unbelievable.That鈥檚 not all. There was construction going on in the main foyer. They started at 8:30 in morning. Sure, if you are a business traveler, you wouldn't care as much because you are leaving early in the morning. But, we were on a romantic vacation trying to sleep in a few hours. When I tactfully requested them to please give a few hours to sleep, they were rude and said they can't because of scheduling. Well, what about our schedule??Who cares if its a romantic hotel in a wonderful area if the staff /management decides to ruin your romantic holiday ? I had planned to propose to my girl firend in Paris that trip, but forced to wait 4 more month when we went to NYC because this trip was so depressing. Nothing like giving some one your hard money so they can insult you and abuse you.There are many, many romantic hotels in Paris with out this hassle.

My stay was four days and my room was on the seventh floor overlooking a courtyard, perfect! Continental breakfast was high in quality and plenty for anyone.Staff, kind and efficient. I was in Paris for five days before heading onto southern France, then back in Paris another two nights...where I was booked into a different hotel on the left bank. It was nice being directly in city center, however, on my return trip, I will be back at the Hotel de Banville.

<Content>Very refreshing change to Paris Hotels... The hotel de Banville was a refreshing change to other Parisian hotels that I'd previously stayed at. The staff were very friendly and helpful, with a nice attitude and a real understanding of customer service.The decor is very individual, each room has been created to have a different theme. This has been done with style and taste, which makes it all the more enjoyable and personal. The rooms are very comfortable, my 4 year old daughter rates the beds as the most 'bounciest' she has ever stayed on. The bathroom is very chic, with a really comfortable bath which is perfect for a good soak after long day walking around Paris.Overall, I'd recomend the hotel to anyone who likes things that are personal and individual, with considered taste and style.Phill GB

<Content>The little gem in Paris We've just returned from our latest trip to Paris-our 47th!!!! We have been staying at the Banville since 1984 and it just gets better each year. The rooms have been updated several times, as has the lobby area. It is a charming place to stay. The hotel is in a neighborhood-people acually live here. You are one block from the bus or the metro or the RER; this makes it incredibly convenient. There are wonderful restaurants wihtin walking distance. There is no need to get into a taxi to go to dinner.The staff is wonderful and extremely helpful. Everyone at the desk speaks English (and languages other than French) so you can always get information. The desk is manned 24 hours a day. We have traveled extnsively and always return to Paris and The Banville.We know you'll love this little gem.

<Content>As Good As It Gets! Bon! Bon! Bon! My bride and I stayed in the Hotel de Banville for two nights...the first two nights of our honeymoon in France. We wanted romance, atmosphere and a 'true Paris' feel, and the Banville delivered.The staff was outstanding, from the first email inquiring about the room, through the last morning we stayed there. Friendly, helpful, bi-lingual, and it seemed, always smiling and happy.The room -- les Preludes -- was immaculate, and decorated to a T. The bathroom was absolutely amazing, with a tub for two, his and hers sinks, lovely accent lighting, and hot, hot water with great water pressure.Our room looked out on the rooftops of Paris, and we were above a busy street. But when the modern double-paned windows were closed, we could hardly hear a thing...and we slept wonderfully on the great big bed with cotton linens.We're both big coffee drinkers, and so were were delighted when we meekly asked at about noon the next day, whether we could get some coffee. In 5 minutes, the staff arrived with a wonderful breakfast....twin pots of coffee, freshly steamed milk, fruit, croissants and sweet butter. So far, wonderful...but wonderful became magical when we visited the piano bar in the lobby later that evening. The owner, Marianne, was singing to the music of a talented pianist. They were great! My bride and I drank champagne Kirs, listened to the music and toasted our good fortune. We met Marianne, and she was so nice. She seemed genuinely touched that we had chosen her hotel for our honeymoon.I would recommend the Hotel de Banville enthusiastically. And I will stay there every time I am in Paris. Guaranteed.

Our toilet overflowed twice!!!! Incredibly rude service on multiple occassions. Terrible restaurant recomendations. Ridiculously expensive breakfast and drinks. 10 Euro for a beer, seriously this place is not the 4 Seasons. In general highly recommended against staying there. If you do stay there, there is a wonderful bakery and pastry shop down the street. The eclairs were.......mmmmm eclairs!!!!

<Content>the jack hammer hotel this has to be one of the worst hotels I have ever had the misfortune to stay at, I booked this hotel because it looked so nice on the website and I fell in love you it , I booked my suite 4 months in advance , when we arrived from Australia after a very long flight ,we arrived at the de banville at 800am wanting a rest after our long flight, of which I had already informed the staff of our arrival time a week in advance ,only be be told we could not check in to the room until 1500hrs so ,already tired we walked around Paris until 300pm ,when we got into our room the shower did not work so we had to have baths , we got into bed ready for a much needed sleep only to be kept up by the sound of jackhammers and drilling for hours on end , we dressed and asked could we have a quite room to sleep ,and were informed that they had no vacant rooms ,when I asked why I was not informed of this when I phoned and talked to them a week before my arrival.They just shrugged and did not care less , since then I have stayed in a number of fantastic hotels in Paris and have been very impressed with each and every one which included the hotel dokhans.,hotel le Vignon ,hotel st paul,the brighton and many others ,but unfortunately this is the sort of thing that can spoil a trip to Paris. I travel to europe every few months at the moment ,but for some people it might be their once in a lifetime trip and, that is the sort of thing that gives Paris a bad reputation.People running hotels with the rude uncaring attitude towards their guests , so my tip is there are so many brilliant and interesting places to stay in wonderful Paris without staying in this 1star whole in the wall ,If they spent as much care on the hotel and clientele as they do with their website the hotel would be much better off also interesting to note in Australia they featured in many travel brochures and now have been taken out of all ,obviously they have had a lot of other unhappy guests

<Content>An un-touristy Paris experience. Clean and quiet with character. I stayed here 5 nights at the end of January on Trip Advisor's recommendations and was not disappointed. This is in an affluent, well-kept residential neighborhood with plenty of restaurants from respectable brasseries to middle eastern and oriental spots. On the weekend, I made us of a huge indoor swimming pool (2 Euros - Piscine Champeret ---) just around the corner and caught some sunshine in a nearby pocket parks. Central Paris is a hike though a walk to the Champs Elysees is doable in about 30 minutes. Fortunately, the metro is just a few steps. I felt like I was a resident of Paris not a tourist and enjoyed the feeling of returning home to the Blvd BerthaThe hotel is very well maintained and nicely decorated. The bathroom was large. The usual European hand-held shower had no curtain. The WC was indeed a closet 鈥?on the opposite side of the room. It really needed some heat. The bed was comfortable 鈥?just the right firmness and there were good size pillows. My window looked out at the Eiffel Tower. The street was quiet at night. So was the hotel. Only once did an hour of wild love-making in the next room keep me awake. It could have been the sound of Channel 18 (the XXX channel) on the nice big LCD TV. As a businessman, I really appreciate the free Internet access. The service went down on Saturday afternoon and the apologetic manager arrived Sunday at 8:30 AM to repair a faulty router. Advice: I never got the WIFI working in the room. I had to use the data port which was located in an inconvenient location at the baseboard. Bring a 2-meter data cable or you'll be surfing while sitting on the floor or you'll have to sit in the lobby for the WIFI.Breakfast seemed a little over priced at 11 Euro. But they served just about everything. I preferred the croissants and coffee in the smoky caf茅 down the street.Guests during my stay included a few Japanese and British tourists, some youngish couples and some male and female business people who had meetings over breakfast in the lobby.There are other hotels in the neighborhood but this seemed to be the most substantial. I'll return.

<Content>The Beautiful Banville Just back from a two day stay at hotel de banville, which I could not recommend more to anyone who wants to experence real Paris. A wonderfully intimate hotel, with extremely friendly staff and modern, romantic decor. But its the room that really got me! Chambre de AMELIE, simple, romantic, beautiful! Everything good that has already been mentioned about this room, is true. We found it very easy to access all of the major tourist attractions from this hotel, using a very efficient transport system. (just do some research before your trip!)Overall, if your looking for a romantic, not overly touristy hotel with a personal feel, that's located in a true parisian part of town...this is the hotel for you!Signed... 25 year old romantic!

<Content>Romantic Rooms Judging by the international clientle when we stayed there recently this hotel has already been discovered,nonetheless its well worthy of mention,a little bit away from the centre its worth making the effort for.The big attraction in what is a relatively small establishment (38 rooms) is the rooms themselves better than many 5* hotels all are different in decor and style are beautifully finished with very good bathrooms and all other facilities,they really are special,the downside to this place is ,no restaurant,a small breakfast area and restricted public areas,but if its the accomadation that matters in a less busy (relatively) area of Paris then this takes some beating,plus being that little bit out of the centre means the prices for what you get are good.

<Content>A Parisian Gem Have just returned from 2 nights at the excellent Hotel de Banville, located in the quiet residential 17th District. We had booked this hotel after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, and were certainly not disappointed.We arrived late (after midnight)following a plane delay, but were greeted with a pleasant disposition, a feature of our holiday, as was the absolutely splendid assistance received from Reception, all conducted in perfect English, and with nothing too much trouble.The area is extremely convenient for the transport network, Porte de Champeret (Metro) and Pereire (Metrop  RER) both less than 5 mins walk, from which you can easily acces the many sites of interest in Paris. Also the area is full of a variety of splendid restaraunts.We have no doubt that when we return to Paris we will definitely use this hotel again.The only slight disappointment, would be that having seen the superb rooms on the web site, we had not booked one of the named rooms, however the fact that we were on the inside overlooking the courtyard meant that we had virtually no noise.

<Content>Best Hotel Room in Paris Recently returned from 4 nights at this hidden gem. From reviews on this website we stayed in La Chambre d'Amelie and were not disappointed. The room has wonderful views of the Eiffel Tower, even from the clawfoot bath, together with the Arc de Triomphe  Sacre Coeur. The hotel is beautifully kept and very clean. It was still very warm in Sept, and we were able to sit on the balcony at midnight and watch the amazing Eiffel Tower light display.It is located in French Paris - away from the tourists. We ate several times at Le Bistro du 17th (a 5 min walk away at 108 Avenue de Villiers) - even on week nights it was full of French people - got to be a good sign. Fabulous food and atmosphere for 32 euros each inc a bottle of wine. There are plenty of good restaurants in the area.Although away from the tourists, all the sites are quick and easy to get to. A 5 min walk away is the Pereire-Levallois RER stop (the RER trains were spacious and uncrowded) which gives a direct 10 min hop to the Eiffel Tower, and other stops along the river - Invalides, Musee D'Orsay, and Notre Dame. The Porte de Champerret metro stop is a 2 min walk away which gives a 10 min direct line to Opera - from here you can walk to the Louvre  Place Vendome. You can buy 2/3 day passes which cover the metro/RER. The hop on/hop off Batobus boat is a good way of travelling up and down the river. The Champs Elysee is a 15 min walk.A great hotel and place to stay if you want to experience real Paris. However, I would recommend booking direct with the hotel by email to ensure you get the room  views that you want. I believe the top three floors give city views.

<Content>Spendy, but worth it. The Hotel de Banville recently earned its 4th star (why does Trip Advisor only show 2?) and it's easy to see why. Everything about this hotel is visually appealing and lovingly maintained -- even the hallways and stairwell are photogenic! Plus, there's an elevator, so you only need to look at the beautfiful stairways as you walk DOWN! We stayed in Amelie's room which has a nice little balcony, complete with small round table and two chairs. From there we could look over the rooftops and get a great view of the Eiffel Tower. Better yet, at night we were treated to the fantastic Eiffel Tower light display. The room was very pretty, and very well kept-up. Amenities such as fluffy robes and an in-room safe were appreciated. The big, clawfoot tub is romantic - only wish there had been a shower, too. (If you hate doing the in-tub pseudo-shower, ask for another room.) The bathroom is well equipped (apart from the missing shower!), with 2 sinks and a separate WC, plus lots of towels, a magnified makeup mirror and so on. The room also had a small desk and chair, and a zoomy flat-screen TV.Hotel de Banville staff are very professional and pleasant. The location in the 17th arr. is quiet (at least by Parisian standards) and pretty. It's convenient to public transportation (which is cheap, clean and reliable...as long as there's no strike in progress!) and although it's not in the throbbing heart of Paris, it's within reasonable walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower, etc. (Fun to do: Walk to the Batobus terminal near the Eiffel Tower and then use the Batobus - the city's floating bus on the Seine - to get around to other locations such as the Musee D'Orsay, the Pompidou, etc.) The lovely Parc Monceau is about a mile away. And here's another plus - go out the front door, turn left and across the street you'll find not only an excellent cheese shop, but a first-rate boulangerie. In fact, the baker recently took best baguette honors, no mean feat in a city which takes its baguettes so seriously! There are only two downsides to the Hotel de Banville. First, the air conditioning is somewhat anemic, and although the neighborhood is pretty quiet, it's not quiet enough to sleep with windows wide open. (This mattered when we were there, as it was 85 to 90 degrees during the day and still too warm/muggy at night.) Also, when you open the window, it automatically shuts off the air. Energy efficient, but a bummer considering the 2nd downside - lots of hotel guests smoke, and the cigarette smell seems to circulate up through the beautiful stairwell and into the rooms.

<Content>Beautiful, authentic and cheap hotel We have just spent two nights at the beautiful Hotel de Banville in Paris. The lobby is really lovely as are the bedrooms. We even had a small balcony out from our room from which we could see the top section of the eiffel tower (and we didnt have to up grade to get it). The rooms are small but have ample space considering the amount of time you spend in them. My only suggestion would be that is you are wanting a hotel which is closer to all the action, this may not be the hotel for you. It is nearest to the Arc du Triomph (easy walk) but the Lourve and the Notre Dam are miles away and unless you like walking (we do but it was still very far away) you may want to stay closer to the latin quarter.

<Content>C'est Magnifique! This hotel is great.First, a couple of quick notes: 1. This is a three star hotel, not two (as this site suggests), and were it not for its size it would be four. 2. The 17th district is not for everyone (thank God). You'll have to walk an extra 15 minutes if you feel compelled to shop in the GAP on the Champs Elysees.Last week, my wife and I took a brief rendezvous to stay in our very favorite room in Paris... at the Hotel de Banville. The staff is incredibly helpful and courteous. The neighborhood is absolutely spectacular, and the decor is flawless. Perfect.It is not a typical tourist hotel. The patrons are upscale business people from all over the world, and the predominant language spoken in the lobby is ALWAYS French (though the staff will speak fluently in a myriad of languages without any attitude). This is the real Paris, folks. Classy, chic and supremely alluring. I recommend de Banville to any and all that may appreciate service, authenticity and a romantic hideaway in the most beautiful city in the world.

<Content>What a gem! Having read all the reviews for this hotel my wife and I decided to have a 2 night stay to celebrate our Silver Wedding. We booked a Pastourelle room and it lived up to our expectations. The room was beautiful, in fact the whole hotel was beautifully furnished. However, we only discovered when we got there that there are 3 Pastourelle rooms, only going up as far as floor 3, so if you want a view over Paris you need to either ask for a room on at least floor 5 or ask for the rooms, Julia, Maria or Amelia. The hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful. Unfortunately the weather wasn鈥檛 very kind to us (it seemed to pour with rain just as we set off to find some where to eat in the evening!) but luckily we found a brilliant restaurant 2 mins walk away on the Avenue de Villiers called 鈥橪e Bistro du 17鈥? A 3 course meal with wine and coffee included was on offer for 32 euros. There were at least 10 choices for each course. Both nights we were there it was packed with French people (always a good sign!). The hotel itself is a 20 mins walk to the Arc de Triomphe but only a 2 mins walk to the metro.The only down side to our stay was that in common with a lot of hotels one could hear the TV on in the room next door, not so good at 7am, but overall a highly recommended hotel and good value for money, especially if you book using a an agent we found on the internet who got us a discount of about 10% and included breakfast.

<Content>The Charming Hotel de Banville We stayed at Hotel de Banville in February of 2003, and were very impressed. The hotel staff was extremely helpful with all of our questions and spoke English very well, which was a relief since my French is terrible. The hotel is near a Metro station and it's in a wonderful and quiet neighborhood. Our room (on the sixth floor) was decorated beautifully and from our window we could see the top of the Eiffel Tower! A great hotel that's as charming on the outside as it is on the inside! I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Should have been better... Hotel de Banville COULD be a very nice place to stay. Our room (the apartment suite) was quite nice, the hotel is clean and pretty, and we loved being outside of the chaos of central Paris. The front desk staff were helpful, crisp and efficient, and gave us some good suggestions.What keeps me from recommending it, or at least from re-visiting, is that the hotel is currently undergoing MAJOR renovations that we were never told about, and I do mean major. I completely understand and applaud updating a property, but DO tell your guests in advance, and offer some discount. Paying full rate and waking each day of your long-dreamed-of vacation to scaffolding and loud drilling - literally right on the other side of your walls - is simply not right. Dust and tarps were everywhere. We experienced bouts of no water, no heat, and no electricity during our stay. Simply let guests know in advance so they can make the choice in time whether to stay or not, and if they do opt to stay, don't charge full rates.If I had to do it again, I would not stay here. I'm sure when the work is done it will be quite lovely, but the experience and the way it was handled left me with a bad taste.

<Content>Beautiful view of Eiffel Tower from balcony! We love this hotel where we just spent our honeymoon! It is so Parisian in every way. From the clawfoot tub to the divine croissants to the dignified, gracious service, we were never disappointed. The location is a bit off the beaten track, but only slightly. The trade-off -- a rich, authentic Paris experience -- was well worth it. Moreover, this is a neighborhood filled with wonderful French bakeries and gorgeous florists. I highly recommend visiting the website and choosing the room that catches your eye. As for romance, when we looked out our window and saw the Eiffel Tower in a shower of lights, we understood why people fall in love in Paris.

<Content>Totally fab! Paris's best kept secret. I've been visiting Paris five to six times a year for the past seven years and have stayed in over 20 hotels from 2* to 5*. This is quite simply the best, perfectly run by the friendliest and most efficient staff in Paris. Of course, room quality can vary but don't be a tightwad, book the best rooms and avoid the cheap ones, you get what you pay for. The apartements are highly recommended but, with any room, if you don't like stiflingly overheated rooms in the winter, take a leathermans tool kit so you can adjust the radiators (they take the knobs off).

<Content>Fantastic Service, Location and Rooms This is one of the best hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in. I would recommend it to anybody who is travelling to Paris. We stayed in the La chambre d'Am茅lie for 3 nights and enjoyed breakfast on the balcony each moning, I must say it was a rare delight.This hotel is very clean and the walk up the stairs to your room is wonderfull, due to the huge mirrors, fantastic lighting and marble effect walls. The entrance to the hotel is small but very inviting and the grand piano in the reception is fantastic.The staff were exceptionally friendly and efficent and they can even arrange for you to be collected at the airport by a chauffer for just a little more expensive than taking a taxi.Dont waste your time by booking and staying in one of the major hotel chains that have sites within paris, go independent for better customer service. We cant wait to go back and stay there soon.

<Content>A Special Place I spent my 40th birthday at this little boutique hotel. As my birthday happens to be on Bastille Day, it was most fitting! We got up too late to go to the Champs Elysee to watch the parade, so saw it on TV, and had a birds eye view from the Appartement de Marie (on the top floor) of the planes flying by. Then I luxuriated in the bath, whilst being able to see the Eiffel Tower - pure delightful decadence!A sweet and delightful romantic Parisian pied-a-terre - a real home from home - we loved it, every minute.

<Content>A wonderful night! We spent one night at the Hotel de Banville last week to end our trip to Paris, Amsterdam, and Bruges. The week before, we'd spent five nights at a two-star in the Latin Quarter, and we decided to splurge a bit for our final night in a different part of the city. The hotel was easily reached from the train station by the Metro, and the nearby RER-C stop whisks you to the Eiffel Tower or Notre Dame/St. Michel.Our room was on the seventh floor, and to our delight our view of city rooftops and trees included the top of the Eiffel Tower. The room itself was spacious, featuring a king-size bed, small loveseat, writing desk, large windows, and a TV. The good-sized bathroom included double sinks. Everything was immaculate.The concierge was helpful and professional, and the hotel itself is beautifully decorated in a classy, modern, unique style--the lobby and hallways are just gorgeous. Overall it was a wonderful stay, and we hope to return someday.
