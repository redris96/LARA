<Content>good room in central location The hotel must have begun life as something else because the lobby appears to have been a bar at one time. Buffet breakfast (not included in our room rate) is served in the bar. It is adequate for the price with the usual cold meats and cheeses, breads and even a hot plate with eggs, sausage and bacon.Our room (103) was a delux room. It was large, very clean and quiet even though there was quite a bit of Christmas noise in the street until about 23.00 each night. There was an elevator to the room but you must walk up 5 or 6 steps to reach it. The desk clerk carried our bags up the stairs to the elevator so that was not a problem. People with mobility issues might want to look elsewhere.The location, as others have said, is excellent. It is a short block from the Plaza Mayor and a few hundred yards from the Puerta del Sol. It is surrounded by restaurants, bars and other places to have a meal or a snack. Most museums and other places of interest are within walking distance within 15 to 30 minutes. The metro is a five minute walk away.Although services are limited, it met all our needs and I would certainly return on our next trip to Madird.

<Content>Liked everything but the noise We stayed for 3 days in September 2007.Location: Excellent. Within walking distance to the main points of interest (e.g., sights, restaurants, shopping). Close to public transportation.Room: We had a corner room on one of the upper floors. Although the room was clean and nicely decorated, I did not like having a corner room. We were right above the bus station and the buses running all night and all day drove me crazy. If you are a light sleeper like me you will find this annoying. The doors for the windows were also broken so we had a hard time closing them (and no one wants to be exposed to the public in their hotel room while changing, in their sleep wear, etc.) I would ask for a room away from the bus stop. However we did have a large view of the plaza, and all the action outside, so maybe for some this would be okay. Front Desk: Very friendly and helpful. Overall: We had a good stay. Would stay here again but away from the bus stop.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay at Plaza mayor very much Hotel Plaza Mayor has an excellent location - you can't get any more central than that. (Next to Plaza Mayor). Still it is very queit at night unlike some other hotels in central locations.At a cost of 85 Euros/day we got a very clean cosy room. It was not big, but not too small - at least you could comfortably unpack in there. Bathroom was impeccable, great shower - loved it.TV has CNN and Eurosport and MTV in English. The room had a balcony with a great view. Buffet breakfast can be purchased at an additional cost of 7.5 Euro. Staff in the hotel is just great. They all speak english, and are helpful, answering all kinds of questions and helping with directions and maps and recommendations. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Very disappointed Have just arrived home fron a 3 night stay. Having read other reviews we decided to go with this one, but what a disappointment. It was one of the worst hotels we have stayed in. We booked a superior, it was drab and smelly with outdated furniture and bed linen that had seen better times. We requested two additional pillows after arrival but what a big problem. No extra pillows were available! It seems you have to bring your own. On our last night after many many requests two were produced. The bathroom was cold, no heating and the towels almost threadbare. The lighting in the room was depressing dull and uninviting. It certainly was not a room to linger in. We looked at some of the other hotels closeby and there is no shortage of superior hotels. Better to look elsewhere .

<Content>Great central location! Hotel Plaza Mayor is really central to everything that we wanted to see. Very close to Atocha train station, to Plaza Mayor, Royal Palace and the Big 3 Museums. We booked through Venere.com based on the reviews on tripadvisor. What we didn't realise was between the reception and the elevator, there were a number of stairs along the way, which makes it quite difficult with our luggages. But the reception did offer help, so that was appreciated. The room that we got was not facing the street so it was pretty quiet, standard size (not big, but not cramped either) and the bathroom was clean. Wireless internet is free but you need to pay if you don't have your laptop with you. Brekky and the use of safety box is not included. Otherwise, this hotel serves the purpose, great location, helpful reception staff who helped with directions, maps and reservations. It has a homey feel to it, as there is living room area in front of our room with books on the shelves (left by previous guests, I assume. Great idea!).

<Content>Looks better on Internet ! This hotel - while not bad - left a lot to be desired for a Tourist Hotel ... the rooms are very small - their photos make them look larger ; no ice was available at all for drinks in room ; very noisy on weekend nights due to people in Plaza across street... BUT ... a very clean place with a helpful staff. I especially liked the free internet and location. Next to Plaza Mayor and much of central Madrid - walking distance to many places. While I did not have a bad experience, I would not stay there again.

<Content>Great Choice for Madrid Break I just returned from a 4 night break in Madrid and was impressed with Hotel Plaza Mayor. We did book the suite on the 6th floor for the extra space but I also saw the superior double room on the 5th floor which was quite spacious for European standards. As the suite is the only room on the 6th floor, we didn't have any problems with noise from other residents and had peaceful sleep each night. The location of the hotel is really central and very convenient for bars, cafes, shopping and sightseeing. We didn't have the breakfast in the hotel as preferred to sample the local cafes and there is plenty of options to choose from. Each room has individual air con / heat which was needed as it was a chilly 5/6 degrees during our stay in Madrid. Staff were pleasant and helpful throughout.I would recommend this hotel to any class of traveller but definitely think the superior rooms on 5th floor or suite is the best option as they aren't too pricey for such a central hotel and worth that little extra cost for comfort.

<Content>#9 on Trip Advisor list of Madrid hotels? Must be a joke! Since my overall experience was very negative, I will list positives first:- Clean- Nice renovated bathroom (marble, good water pressure)- Friendly and helpful front desk staff- Location (next to plaza Mayor, 2 mins walk to Puerta del Sol)The hotel itself and the room are clearly nothing more than a 2* -- chintzy furniture, spartan bed, skinny pillows, ratty blanket, no mini fridge, pay extra for safe.So how come I rated it a 1* instead of 2+? Counting down in order:3) First floor window faced into an inner courtside. That mean no external noise on the one hand, but on the other hand created an impression of being entombed at the bottom of a narrow well. It might as well have been made into a wall instead of a window. Dingy room paint  furniture inside + absence of natural light (let alone a decent view) outside meant for a depressing overall feeling. Best advice is just sleep and get out.2) Price: Paying 95 euros a night for this hotel is a ripioff. There are got to be tons of better hotels for same money or same hotels for less money.3) A must for a hotel is to allow a good night sleep. However the room acoustics would be worthy of a fine concert hall. Late night revelers coming back to the hotel? Will keep you up. Somebody talking at normal volume? You will hear. Turning on a tap or a shower in a neighboring room? Sounds like Niagara next door. No I am not kidding and I am not an extremely light sleeper. However 3 out of 4 nights we were woken up and kept up until the noise stopped.For the heck of it after the first depressing night we stopped by Hotel Regente near by and asked to see their room (being made up). Both hotel  room are much nicer looking (hotel is listed as 3*), they had vacancy...and the cost was only 80 euros. The only reason we didn't switch was because Hotel Mayor held us hostage (i.e. would have meant paying 1 night penalty for cancellation).In short, unless you are truly desperate (last minute) or can get an amazing rate, look elsewhere. But if you ignore my advice and go by many more people who loved this hotel can't all be wrong, my feelings won't be hurt :-)

We asked for a quiet room  got it - didn't face onto street. Room was a little on the small side - bathroom very small.Didn't take breakfast in hotel - went to Cafe Esparteros on the street of the same name. Try the porras with cafe con leche.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Value My daughter  I stayed at this hotel after reviewing guest reviews on this site. We were undecided btween this one and the Hotel Europa. We were very glad we picked the Plaza Mayor, we liked the location much better. Great location, quiet at night, helpful, professional, multi-lingual staff. Close to everything and the Plaza del Sol Metro.We stayed on a corner room on the 5th Floor which was big for European standards. Very clean, cold air conditioning, balcony overlooking square. All in all, w/very much recommend this hotel

<Content>Great location, good price, overall excellent value Picked the hotel using TripAdvisor and was not disappointed. Was great for the the price. Had been to Madrid before and wanted to be near lots of bars, restaurants etc. Couldn't have been in a better place - seconds from the Plaza Mayor and two minutes from the Puerta del Sol.Hotel quiet, public areas characterful and our room (on the side of the hotel) decent size and nice and clean. The reviews were right about the quietness - I could hear the swish of trousers as someone walked down the corridor at nighttime !I would happily go back to this hotel as the location just cannot be beaten for the price.

<Content>A Gem We recently stayed here four nights and really enjoyed our stay. The best aspect of this hotel is its location. It is centrally located in Madrid and just a short walk to most major sites. Only about a 10 minute walk to the train station which is very handy for side trips to Toledo, El Escorial, etc. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We'd like to give a shout-out to Dominique, who was particularly helpful. The rooms are clean and tastefully decorated. Our room was actually a little larger than what we have come to expect from most European hotels. While you're in Madrid make sure to frequent the local tapa bars. We really enjoyed Casa Toni (awesome fried eggplant), Oreja de Oro (sauteed miniature green peppers, my fave), and La Casa del Abuelo (anything with shrimp is great). Also make sure to try churros con chocolate at Chocolateria San Gines, near Puerta del Sol. Also a few restaurants we enjoyed were La Gloria de Montera Restaurante and La Paella Real Restaurante.

<Content>A Great find! This hotel boasts both a great price and a great location on the edge of the plaza mayor! The staff are helpful and friendly and assisted us with booking tours and general advice.While the hotel itself is lovely with good views from the front rooms, myself and two others stayed in the hotel's apartment just around the corner as the rooms were booked out.The apartment was perfect, nicely decorated, lovely and clean with marble lined bathroom. It has one double room and a comfy sofa bed in the living area. Ther is also a nice pool at the rear of the complex.I would recommend both the hotel and the apartment for your stay in Madrid! The price is fantastic and oh did I say the staff were lovely already!!

<Content>Top Location We stayed here for two nights in early September 2008. This is a good hotel. It is very well located a few steps away from Plaza Mayor and plenty of restaurants and shopping. Our room was an internal one with a small window looking out into an internal patio area. The room was small but clean with an excellent shower. Since we didn't spend much time in our room it was fine, but if you are looking for luxury, look elsewhere. We paid extra for breakfast and it was fairly standard fare, but nice. Staff were friendly and helpful. We would stay here again.

On the downside very small rooms. My room was quite dark but since I was there only at night ok. My room was not to the street so very calm. That was nice. Highly recommended. I did not took breakfast, since not included. But a lot of restaurants nearby. Nice City hotel will come back again.

<Content>Great value, perfect position Booked this hotel after hours of research on t'internet, finally discovering Tripadvisor.com and going with their recommendation! Nicely priced hotel, 275 euros for three nights over Bank Holiday (inc. tax), extremely clean and smart. Good customer care, even tho a non-working room safe couldn't be fixed and no reasonable alternative available. Best thing about this hotel is the location. Right next to Plaza Mayor and a spit away from many other must see sights. Having read reviews of other hotels in Madrid it seems that this is a popular complaint but... Take ear plugs with you for night time! There's something about the construction of the building which means that all and any noise from other guests, no matter how considerate or reasonable they're being, reverberates around the rooms. Every foot fall, tap being turned on, shower being run WILL disturb you. Very odd. My top tips: Don't bother with the hotel buffet breakfast. Get up. Get out and sample one of the many little bars which do kick-you-in-the-arse wake up coffee, croissants and toast. DO NOT go to Plaza Mayor on your first night, a little bit tired and weary, sit down at one of the tables in the Plaza corner and say 'Si' to any waiter who comes up and says I will bring you tapas. Tonight you eat like Spaniards, yes? Because if you do, then like us (uninitiated in the ways of tapas, virgin Madrid types) you will be brought six plates of varying dead sea creatures, including tentacles, all of which I'm sure were really delicious if that's your thing. But then, and most importantly, you will be charged... 97.50 euros!!!! (That's 拢78!!) Budget blown, feeling a bit ripped off, we were much more cautious the rest of the weekend and found excellent restaurants and tapas bars everywhere for very reasonable prices. Hey, you live and learn!DO use the Metro. Cheap and straight forward. And finally, DO as the Madrinelos do and wander slowly, admiring the awesome statues, historic buildings and creaky old bars. Stopping every 45 minutes or so for 'refreshments'. My kind of weekend...

<Content>Ideal Location and Great Value A small, apparently family-owned hotel located just a few steps from Plaza Mayor. Ideally located for all major attractions in Madrid. The staff are very friendly and helpful, even loaning us a Nokia phone charger and checking the location of a restaurant that another Tripadvisor traveller had recommended.We booked directly with the hotel, through its website, having seen a recommendation in the Saturday Travel section of The Daily Telegraph in July 2008. Initially, we requested a corner room (as others had suggested) at 95 Euros per night, but enquired about the suite. The hotel replied within 12 hours, confirming its availability. At 120 Euros, we thought it very good value, considering its size (basically, in the hotel attic/loft) and facilities (a super outside terrace - 6 floor up and with views over the Madrid rooftops!). The only slight downsides were a bed that began to feel a little hard after 4 nights (it is a firm mattress onto a solid divan) and some small amount of noise that permeated the roof (although these were police sirens, and so very loud). You also need to lug bags up the final short flight of steps from the 5th floor, as the lift stops there, so it's worth remembering for those who may struggle. My wife was not so impressed with the lack of a mirror in the room, although there is one with ample lighting in the bathroom. The TV has a variety of European channels, plus CNN and Eurosport. There was also (what appeared to be) a DVD player, though we didn't use it.We visited at an exceptionally hot time (late 30s Celsius), but the room AirCon worked well and the curtains and roof blinds (for the 3 Velux windows) kept out the heat and light. Others have criticised the bathroom for 'only' having one sink! However, we found this to be ample, as it is large and square. The shower could easily accommodate two people, and whilst it didn't seem to drain especially well during use, it never overflowed. Water pressure was fine and supplies of soap and towels plentiful. The room was always kept very clean and laundry changed regularly. Decor is pleasant - stylist, yet subtle. The impression was one of a staff who took pride in the hotel, as there were even pot plants on the terrace.Overall, a great room and a lovely small hotel. We would not have changed it.We took breakfast on the first morning. At 7.50 Euros per person, it is fine if you're hungry/thirsty, as you can help yourselves to the usual selection of fruit, juice, coffee, cheese, bread, croissants, etc. We tried other places for breakfast, too. These were cheaper, but only because you pay per item. For example, juice, coffee and a slice of toast at the cafe diagonally across the small square in front of the hotel cost us around 5 Euros each. As an alternative, we bought some fruit, juice, etc. and breakfasted on the terrace, before grabbing a coffee later.Overall, we'd definitely recommend this hotel. Although it has no pool, restaurant (for lunch/dinner), gym, etc. its superb location and overall value make it hard to beat. We would be very happy to return.From the Airport, the Metro will take you to Sol, from which it's a 5-10 min walk. We were warned about pickpockets, so be careful, though we never encountered any problems and noticed a good police presence on the streets. Sol is very busy, and an obvious target area. Metro lines are numbered and colour-coded, so it's easy to travel around. Tickets from (or to) the Airport cost 2 Euros each (a higher price than travelling around within the city), but you can buy a ticket for 10 trips and use that between 2 or more people once you're travelling around in central Madrid. Ticket machines take coins and notes, but we never managed to get the credit card ones to accept out UK cards. They also have an option for English text, which is helpful.Credit cards are widely accepted, but be aware that they sometimes ask for photo ID. We encountered a grumpy woman at the Prado who refused to accept a card without one. This requirement is not universally applied, and so can catch you out. We visited Toledo one day (9 Euros per person each way) and had no trouble buying the ticket at Madrid, but had to show ID at Toledo. The fast train leaves from Platform 8 (from recollection) and takes 30 mins. You need to buy a ticket at each end.We visited the usual sites, but one worth considering is Plaza de la Villa (the old Town Hall), just off C/Mayor at the Palacio Real end, which provides free guided tours in English on a Monday evening only (at 17:00, from recollection). This is worth visiting for the short tour of an old and interesting building, although some of the interiors may change once the Mayor's offices relocates to alternative accommodation in Madrid.We would suggest a (free) visit to the gardens of the Palacio Real, which are located behind and below the Palace. The ONLY entrance and exit is a small gate off Paseo de la Virgen de Puerto, near to the Principe Rio Metro end. We discovered this on our final morning, sadly too late to spend too much time there or to take a picnic. There are lovely walks, tame birds, fountains and a small pond with terrapins and ducklings. We thought it much nicer than the Parque de el Retiro, as the gardens are more carefully tended and therefore closer to what we would expect to see in a similar grand house/palace garden here in the UK. Definitely worth a visit for a 'green' break from the city.Restaurants:We tried El Escaldon for Tapas (non-smoking upstairs) on C/Cava Baja, but there are lots of others on the same street - just a 5 min walk from Plaza Mayor. Tapas for 2, with desert, Sangria/water/coffee came to around 62 Euros. Service was very pleasant and the food good.We also followed the recommendations posted by other travellers and dined at La Gloria Montera (twice!) on C/Caballero de Gracia (just down from Gran Via Metro) and La Finca de Susana on C/Ariaban (close to Sevilla Metro). Both were superb, but also very popular with the Spanish. They are both non-smoking, offer a variety of food and open around 20:30. Highly recommended! We could not understand why people would choose Macdonald's over restaurants such as these which offer superb food and service, in lovely surroundings at a very good price. One thing that we did notice is that neither place applied the usual rip-off prices for wine that we have to put up with in the UK. In fact, the wine was very pleasant and inexpensive - a quite reasonable bottle being less than 10 Euros. Our meal for 2 (3 courses with wine/water) came to around 50 Euros. Excellent value!All three restaurants take credit cards and have English-speaking staff.We also used Cerveceria 100 Montaditos, next to the Opera House (close to Opera Metro) for lunch. They do small rolls with 100 different fillings, are cheap and great for lunch. 6 rolls is ample for 2 people. With 2 juices/waters/coffees, our bill was 15 Euros. We heard that this place was being recommended by tour guides. The staff were friendly, but spoke mainly Spanish.The nearest Tourist Information is on Plaza Mayor.We hope that you find this information helpful in planning your visit to Madrid and that you enjoy the city as much as we did!

<Content>Great Locationand Great Value I stayed at Hotel Plaza Mayor from 6/26/08 to 6/29/08. What a location! When you step out of the hotel, you are at the entrance to Plaza Mayor. I thought the hotel location was very convenient for my sightseeing. The hotel staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. The buffet style breakfast was good. The room and bathroom were clean and efficient. A/C in the room worked fine and helped me a lot in that hot weather. My overall experience at this hotel was excellent for such a low room rate! The only thing I would like to see improved is a cover for the bed. The blanket I used to sleep looked somewhat old. If the hotel put some cover for that kind of blanket, the impression would have been much better. My room faced the road Atocha and the noise from the traffic was quite loud. Next time I would ask for a room in the back.

<Content>A Quintiessential Small European Hotel Like others, when travelling to Europe, I have a picture of a hotel in my head. You know the type; often described as 'romantic' or 'quaint' . Four to six stories high. Small, but not too small. Not on a big thoroughfare, but not impossible to find either. Near the sites in a neighbourhood oozing the local culture. Full of old world charm but not lacking in the modern amenity category. A room that when you wake-up you know immediately you are in Europe. Well, this hotel fufilled my fantasy on every level! Start with the location, overlooking the Plaza Santa Cruz and only 150 meters from the Plaza Mayor, perhaps Madrid's classiest destination. The building is mature, but the hotel is only 10 years old. It is tastefully decorated throughout and well engineered. Let me focus on the wonderfull windows, over two meters high that allow plenty of light and fresh air in. Close the shutters and it becomes as dark as you need and the glass window is well constructed so that it is remarkable how much outside noise it mutes. I even liked the breakfast (maligned by other reviewers). At 7 euros it comes hassle-free and is fresh and varied so that you are bound to find something you like. At night, the desk clerk will often let you use the internet for free. Here are some local tips. The city's best tourist information office is in the Plaza Mayor. From it, you can catch some real cheap, English speaking, walking tours (Madrid must be the most easily walkable great city). The Calle de la Bolsa is a small, pedestrian friendly street that starts just outside of the hotel and easily links with the Plaza Santa Ana and eventually the Paseo del Prado.

<Content>Excellent value and location-Get the Palomar suite The location was great. The staff were friendly (with one minor exception). We had the Palomar suite (Room 600) awesome suite, great balcony with private roof top view and beautiful sunsets. Really unique and special room, for the price it was incredible. The elevator goes to the fifth floor, this is on the sixth, so you should know you have to walk a short flight of stair. Well worth it. I would see the need to stay anywhere else even if money was no object.David

Location is brilliant, so close to everything. We got a taxi from the airport which cost 鈧?5 which i though was a bit steep - if you have time take the metro as it only costs 鈧? per person and is very easy. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>As good as promised I had planned our trip to Spain for the past year and the consensus opinion amongst all of the guidebooks I regularly use (Rick Steves, Frommer's and Lonely Planet) about where to stay in Madrid was the Hotel Plaza Mayor so I never really considered any other place. I have to say that they were all right on the money. We stayed in Madrid for four nights and could tell right off the bat that our stay was going to be enjoyable. The location couldn't be beat - a stone's throw from the Plaza and a five minute walk from the Puerta del Sol. And although it was so centrally located the outside noise from the street was not too bad at all and keep in mind that our first night there was the start of the San Isidro Festival! The room size was fairly large by my knowledge of European standards and the bathroom was also of a good size. We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was excellent - a selection of hams and sausages as well as bread and fruit, etc. Everyone at the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful and did their best to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. And the kicker is - the rates (even factoring in the lousy dollar/euro exchange rate) were extremely reasonable. To sum up, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Hotel Plaza Mayor to anyone visiting Madrid.

<Content>Nice Hotel Booked this hotel based on reviews on here and because it was the only budget hotel in the top 10.We were not dissapointed as we thought it represented good value for money (we booked directly through the hotel's website).Good Points:Central location yards from Plaza Mayor.Reception generally helpful and friendly.Room was of a good size and with three windows was light and airy (we had a corner room on the 5th floor overlooking Plaza Cruz at the front of the hotel, I had requested a corner room following suggestions on here).Bath and Shower !Negative:Can't really think of any - can't comment on the breakfast as we always go to local cafes. I believe it's 7.5 euros per person which isn't bad for a hotel.Don't bother with the (pay) internet in reception - there's an internet place just across the street.We would definately book here again if we were to return to Madrid (although, whisper it, we tend to go to Barcelona as my father lives near there).

<Content>Perfect location! The location of the hotel could not have been better. The hotel is small but clean, the shower had great water pressure, and the staff were friendly. Exactly what you want in a hotel that you aren't going to be spending much time in anyway. Do not expect a hairdryer, but the TV did have CNN in English.

<Content>Great location and great price We stayed here for three nights with another couple. The location of this hotel is the best. We could see Plaza Mayor from our window. The desk staff was more than helpful. We ate breakfast in the lobby two of the mornings. They had a very good selection for a little over 7 Euros. We also played cards in the breakfast area a few times, which was nice. Many of the hotels don't have tables for this. We upgraded to a superior room, which was not that expensive. I didn't think the room was that large until I saw a door open to another room. After seeing how tiny the room was, I realized we had made a good decision. The rooms were very modern. The bathrooms were awesome. They looked as if they had just been remodeled. We used the internet in the lobby for a minimal charge, which was very convenient. I would definitely recommend this hotel if staying in Madrid.

<Content>Perfect! I have now been back in Denmark for almost 5 hours and I just NEED to write this review.I have lived in Spain and been to Madrid 3 times before. Once at Hostal Lisboa (in 1993 when I was a bit younger ;-), once at Hotel Cortiz (that is now closed as the building is under reconstruction) and once at a hotel Iberia paid for me.So this time around I needed a new hotel and went to Tripadvisor to look for some advice.I knew the area should be some place around Sol, preferably on the South side between Plaza Mayor, Plaza Santa Ana and Plaza Tirso Molina. Smack in the middle there it was:Hotel Plaza Mayorwith the right price, the right place and the right feedback on TA.And was that just a perfect hotel!!!It was a stay over 2 times (did a road trip in between) and I stayed in both room 502 (with rooftop view over Madrid) and room 115 (a bit larger room and it looked quite newly refurbished). Both rooms where perfect and had their windows out to a pedestrian (and therefore silent) street.The reception desk was helpful, the area great, the everything was just as it should be.Stay there when in Madrid - I'll do the next time!

<Content>Definitely to recommend We booked in January for April stay after checking TA and Venere. Received easy-followed instructions on how to reach hotel from Metro station Sol. No problems with check-in, all of the 3 receptionists talked good enough English. Lift, there are 5 room levels. Clean room, small bathroom with tub but no bidet. A small writing desk. Windows opened to the street, thru-fare, a little noisy. Safe in clothes closet, small TV with Spanish channels + CNN (for those who cannot live without news). Internet pc in lobby, free WII (not in rooms) for those bringing their own PC. Coffee machine. Breakfast OK. Locker for temporarily storing luggage. Very central location, walking distance from main museum area and Palacio Real. A good 3-star, definitely recommended as basic tourist hotel.

<Content>Good Location The hotel is located right next to Plaza Mayor and is a few minutes walk to SOL metro station. The room is pretty basic but the bathroom was above average with very good water pressure. The staffs here were very good, they will go out of their way to explain you directions and other queries that you may have. If you are looking for place to crash at night and will be spending your day exploring madrid and I would recommend this place. It is great for the price. I paid Euro 85 per night for double room excluding tax and breakfast thru hotel web. Look no further.

<Content>Central, clean hotel with helpful staff. Just stayed at the Plaza Mayor based on therecommendations found here. We found the place central - Plaza Mayor a stones throw away, The Prado and The Reina Sofia 10 - 15 mins down c/Atocha if you can resist stopping at the fab bakers and cafes as you walk down the hill and Puerta del Sol 5 mins. The room was clean and the staff helpful - on our final day the receptionist told us to go and see the Changing of the Guard at the Royal Palace (10 minutes walk) - we were not aware it was on as it only takes place every 1st Wednesday of the month from September to June. Some good restaurants not very far away are 'La Finca de Susana' on c/Arlaban and a bit closer 'Ginger' on Plaza del Angel - both look upmarket but have reasonably priced interesting menus and definitely worth a visit for their menu del dia at lunch (siesta obligatory afterwards!) or dining a la carte in the evening. Moore's Irish Pub just off the north side of Plaza Mayor is worth a visit for a refreshing pint of the black stuff, especially if you are a sad Man Utd fan who cannot miss a match even whilst having a jolly in Madrid. You can take the lad out of Manchester but you cannot take Manchester out of the lad! Looking for a more authentic Castllian bar - try Naturbier on Plaza Santa Ana with an interesting variety of sausages on the menu as well as their microbrewed beer. Unfortunately one sight in Madrid that definitely did not impress was the Bernabeu - but you may suspect we were slightly biased!

<Content>Very nice small hotel Centrally situated. I stayed at the hotel over the Easter Weekend for 4 nights with my family, and had two rooms(one superior twin, and one triple), the rooms were very similiar, and although fairly small were sufficient for our needs. Rooms had a flat screen tv with access to around 10 TV channels, although only CNN was in English. Bathrooms were ok with a bath and shower, although the bath was fairly small.We requested quiet rooms, which were on the first floor towards the back of the hotel, and were not disturbed at all by noise. The hotel was very clean, and the staff were very friendly. There is a small breakfast area near reception and the breakfasts on offer seemed very good, however as the breakfast was not included in the price we choose to eat out. The Museo de Jarbon was the best place we found for breakfast, but there are lots of other alternatives. The hotel is well situated, about 100 yards from Plaza Mayor, and close to the Sol Metro station. The Hotel was easy to get to from the airport by metro, although you do have to change trains at least twice due to the layout of the metro system. The royal palace, and the main musuems can be walked to within 15 minutes. I should mention two wonderful restaurants about 5 to 10 minutes walk away from the hotel (La Finca de Susana on C/Ariabain, and La Gloria de Montera on C/Caballero de Gracia) which I would highly recommend. Neither can be booked, so it is worth getting there 10 minutes before they open at 8.30pm. There was a long queue of locals at both restaurants, which is always a good sign. The food was wonderful with a varied menu, and very reasonable (鈧?00 for 5) It is also worth going to a show at Las Carboneras if you are interested in getting a taste of flamenco dancing. This is only 5 minutes from the hotel across Plaza Mayor..

<Content>fab location We stayed at the plaza mayor hotel for 3 nights in February. We booked it through the hotel web site direct. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from Sol metro station and you can see Plaza Mayor from the hotel through an archway. The hotel was very clean and the bedrooms were perfect. They were cleaned every day and we had a corner room with a view over the square. We had no problems with any noise from the street. The staff were very helpful and spoke very good english.We didn't try the breakfast, we preferred to be out  about soaking up the madrid atmosphere. I would highly recommend anyone to stay at this hotel, for the money it can't be beaten. We paid about 鈧?00/night including taxes.

<Content>OK and central I stayed at the Plaza Mayor weekend 8 - 10 Feb 2008. It is very central, very near the Placa Mayor and within easy reach of all attractions and nightlife. It is OK, not the great find I thought from other reviews, I have stayed in better and worse. It is just on the money for value, not cheap and not expensive either. However, recent refurbishment has left it a noisey hotel; doors slam, showers are heared and even quiet conversation carries. This is OK if you join in the very late night life in the surroundings but not if you need to sleep.If you arrive via the airport take the metro to Sol and it is less than 5 mins walk to the hotel.Breakfast is on offer for E7.50 but better value can be found in local cafes.

<Content>The Best Value Base in Madrid This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and I suppose thats endorsement enough but I cannot enthuse enough about the value for money this hotel is.The rooms are adequate in size with good size bathrooms. They are smart and tastefully decorated.Location wise it is perfect. Situated just outside Plaza Mayor it is handy for Puerta del Sol and the rest of Madrid's attractions. The staff are extremely helpful and all this for 80euros a night.Fantastic.

Only thing that might be negative for light sleepers is the thin walls. Did not bother us, but I know that someone was bothered by us. So sorry to all of you staying there between 18th and 21th of january:) One thing I need to say if you plan to stay there. Even though you are very hungry, do not eat at the casa carmen just down the street. Looks great, priced like it is excellent, but do not get fooled. Raw salmon, cold lasagna etc.

<Content>excellent address for a budget priced hotel Chose the hotel on previous recommendations by tripadvisor. Zero disappointments. Everything perfect for a budget priced hotel. Price, location, super clean, friendly staff, good breakfast, everything up to date, excellent heating, no stains/marks on walls to look at. Clean towels every day. Total change of bed linen after the second day. We booked direct and had a discount for December (low season). If you stay in budget priced hotels, then this one will please you. What a pity London doesn't offer hotels like this - but then that's another story. Madrid is a good city to visit and we found it much cheaper than other European cities. The Plaza Mayor added to our very enjoyable trip.

<Content>Lovely, comfortable and affordable After a week of equestrian training on Mallorca, my friend and I decided to visit Madrid and needed to book some last minute accomidations that would be within out budgets. We lucked out and found the Plaza Mayor Hotel, right outside the beautiful plaza itselt. The hotel itself has a great deal of old world charm, but with the modern amenities that make for a comfortable stay. We had a lovely room overlooking the street, but it was amazingly quiet. The hotel was a quick walk to the plaza with numerous restaurants and shops and while the staff's English was a bit limited at times, they tried to be very helpful in advising us what sites to visit. All in all we were very pleased and very happy with our stay there. I would most definately recommend it.

<Content>clean, comfortable, affordable Traveling to Madrid as a solo female, I felt safe in this very clean and well-located hotel (just steps from the Plaza del Sol and the Plaza Mayor). From my initial experience booking on the Internet, to checking in and out, I found the employees of the Hotel Plaza Mayor to be muy amable...very kind and helpful. English spoken here, though all tolerated my sincere attempts to speak Spanish. I stayed in room 504, a small room with a twin bed, for 60 euros per night. The bathroom (toilet, sink, shower) was spotless, and yes, small again. But who spends much time in their room in Madrid? I was very happy with the room, for the price. The room also had a safe (1.2 Euros per day), a TV, and a desk. Pequeno, si, but functional. My room overlooked a small, charming Plaza, which was busy for much of the day and into the night, but on the 5th floor, I heard very little with windows closed. No sounds from other rooms either, though the hotel was almost full during the time I was there.The Hotel offers breakfast for an additional fee. I recommend trying the small cafe directly across the plaza (to the left) in front of the Hotel, for a cafe con leche and pastry (2.10 Euros).Also - Consider having dinner with steak (solomillo) at Casa Paco's, a few minutes' walk from the Hotel (Puerta Cerrada 11, just off the Plaza Mayor), with salad and Valdepenas red wine. This will set you back a few Euros, but worth every penny. Enjoy.

<Content>Nice hotel near Plaza Mayor This hotel was nice, with a charming facade and interior. Our room was clean and air conditioned; we stayed on an upper front corner, room 203. Our room was large and had all the amenities, including a desk. The best thing was that it was well insulated from the pollution and noise of this district, yet the windows were quite large so the room had very good light. The bathroom was all tile with a tub/shower. The elevator was handy, although there are stairs before you get there. The staff was friendly, bilingual, professional, and available 24 hours. I'd skip the breakfast; it is overpriced and not very interesting. Instead try the litte Peter Pan coffee shop down the street. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Small hotel, small rooms. Good location The hotel is in the center of Madrid so it is far from the airport.If you are going for sightseeing, it s a very good location. It is not for business trips. The rooms are very small. You can here everything coughs, sneezing conversations ..everything. If you are over say 6ft you wouldn t fit in the beds. The staff is nice. The hotel is basically clean. Bathrooms are way small. So bottom line for the 70 or 80 euros you can get any hotel you want just by booking through the airline. Anyone who gives this a 5 or says it s a gem must have never traveled before. If you re not in the hotel all day it may work. If you plan to be in the room say two hours during the day and 6-7 hours to sleep it s going to be way uncomfortable. There are local hotel chains which may not be as nice on the outside, but are way more comfortable inside and have much bigger rooms and higher ceilings. Bottom line, a good hotel, not the best, not the worst, a 3 at best. Best is location if you re on vacation, worst is small rooms, 4 x 4 ft bathrooms, small beds and paper thin walls. Lobby smells awful during breakfast hour.All in all, its doable for folks on vacation

<Content>Amazing Value My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and were amazed by the value we were getting for the price we paid. The room was even more spacious than we anticipated. In addition, the bathroom was among the largest we've seen in a European hotel, with a great shower.The location of the hotel is a big plus, directly off the Plaza Mayor and a short walk to the Sol metro station (within the Puerta del Sol). We were able to easily walk from the hotel to the Royal Palace and Prado Museum as well.We were unsure of how noisy it would be at night, but everything was perfect - we slept too well here! It would help if there were a clock in the room, because with the shades closed, we could not tell noon from midnight. To me though, this was a good thing!The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful as well. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to all others.

<Content>Great hotel in a prime location I was very happy with my decision to stay at the Plaza Mayor during my visit to Madrid.I stayed in a superior double room which are apparently only on the first floor. I was nervous that there would be a lot of street noise, but the first floor of the hotel is actually off the street and reallymore like a second floor. The walls are thin and if there is a lot of noise inside or outside you will hear it but I didn't have a problem.The other guests were quiet and the hotel is not located on a super busy street so the sounds outside were not a problem. I was expecting the room to be tiny, but I actually thought it was a good size by European standards. Even the bathroom was a decent size...there is an actual tub and not just a stand up shower. The water pressure and temperature of the hot water was great and that can be rare! The subway, shopping areas and many restaurants are very close by.Breakfast is extra: 7 Euros/person. I never tried it. I did go to the famous Chocolateria San Gines a couple of blocks away for their chocolat con churros and that was great. Also close by is Botin, the oldest restaurant in the world!

<Content>Good value in Madrid After staying in 3 and 4-star hotels on our trip through Andalucia, our last stop before flying home was in Madrid and we did not want to spend a lot of money on a hotel. So the 2-star Plaza Mayor proved to be a very satisfactory solution.The hotel location is excellent. It is near the very touristy Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol, but is far enough away to be fairly quiet and relatively uncrowded. The room was clean, quiet and large enough for our needs. The bathroom was OK but could have used some shelf space and the towels were skimpy. However, the shower and other plumbing was good and worked well. The front desk staff was helpful and spoke good english.

<Content>Good--but compare to the Europa Hotel Plaza Mayor IS a very close walk to one of the city's prime tourist attractions: the Plaza itself. My son and I found it to be clean, safe and convenient. The showers were extraordinarily small, however. For the same price (actually at bit less I think, because tax was included), we also stayed at the Hotel Europa one night. That place had larger rooms and showers, and was NO less centrally located (right by the Plaze del Sol--a very convenient metro stop.) The Europa also had a restaurant right off the lobby, and free internet (which Plaza Mayor did not). So while they both represent good values for the money, I would recommend Europa over this place.

<Content>Spectacular Value! I just returned from a trip to Madrid, and stayed at Hotel Plaza Mayor for five nights. Two were in a double room, and three in a single. I found this hotel to be an exceptional value! It is one block from Plaza Mayor and easily walkable to all the sights. The hotel was recently renovated and a lot of attention went into the details. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The rooms were very nice, and fairly spacious in my experience with European hotels. They have full bathrooms as well, which was nice. For being on a main road, the rooms were incredibly quiet too! This hotel is priced much less than most that we saw on Tripadvisor in Madrid, and was a great find that I would recommend to anyone that I know!

<Content>Exactly What we Were Looking For! We were very pleased with our stay at Plaza Mayor. We arrived early and were still able to check in. I had requested a corner room on the top floor (recommended by other travellers). They gladly accomodated the request and as a result had a great view and were away from most of the street noise. Situated right off the Plaza Mayor and close to the Sol Metro station, we were well situated to have a great stay in Madrid. We found the hotel staff to be friendly and as helpful as they could with the language barrier. There were also great food spots close by off Calle Barcelona.

<Content>A good choice In. contrast to the previous review I found the staff very friendly and helpful and all spoke good English. One in particular spent a long time translating a menu for us. The hotel is in an excellent position and how quiet the rooms are will depend on if you have one by the street or inside. We had one inside which was very quiet but lacked a little natural light. The windows are tall but face a small courtyard with rooms above. If you want ventilation you will have to stand on a chair to open the top hung window although there is air conditioning. The rooms were clean but basic, i.e laminate floors instead of carpet but better clean laminate than stained carpet. The bathroom was fine but beware of sudden changes in water temperature when using the shower, also our friends in another room had to run the water for a while to get it hot.The breakfast consisted of cereals, toast,bread,fruit, juices, pastries , bacon and scrambled eggs. My friends and I thought it was ample and good value. There are safes in the rooms to hire for 1.5 euros a day. All things considered I think for a 2 star hotel in that location it was a good choice. You could easily spend a lot more and get a lot less for it. I was more than happy with our stay and think the hotel deserves the positive reviews it gets from the majority of posters.

<Content>Just ok My mom (60) and I (26) stayed in the Hotel Plaza Mayor for 4 nights on an August/September 5 week trip to Europe. This hotel was just ok. It is well-situated right next to gorgeous Plaza Mayor and is clean and comfortable, but the folks at the desk barely speak English and are very UNHELPFUL with dinner reservations, recommendations, etc. Do not expect good service. For example, the desk forgot to order us a cab to the airport, forgot to make our dinner reservations at Botin (which we did manage to get into a different night - highly recommended), and was unwilling to let 2 of us sleep in one of the single rooms one night even though the single room has a double bed. Also, the breakfast is very overpriced and did not look too appealling.

<Content>Enjoyable stay We stayed for one week in the Plaza Mayor. We found it an excellent hotel and very good value for the money that we had paid and the location is ideal. The room was large and the hotel was very clean.The staff were very helpful and friendly.As with most city centre Hotels traffic noise was a slight problem.Will use this hotel on our future visits.

<Content>Great Hotel Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Plaza Mayor. The hotel was excellent and extremely good value for money. We booked directly through the hotels website after being recommended in 3 travel books and the reviews on here. We were not let down. The room was spacious and had plenty of room for everything. There was a flat wide screen tv on the wall, and a safe could be rented for 鈧?.20 a night. Bathroom was of adequate size with an excellent shower.The lights in the hallway do have to be switched on - we were at the end of the very long corridor but this was never a problem as the switches glow. Our room looked out onto one of the side streets, and outside noise was not a problem. We were however woken by what must've been a noisy pipe system!Location was fantastic - everything was so close, and could not have asked for more. 2 mins to the Plaza Mayor and about 5 mins from Sol Station. The staff were very nice and friendly and helpful when we wanted train times. There is also somewhere where you can leave your luggage after check out.I would definitly recommend the hotel and would stay here again.

<Content>A Very Nice Place to Stay I traveled solo to Madrid, Barcelona, and Toledo at the end of May, and I stayed in four different hotels. Out of all of them, Hotel Plaza Mayor in Madrid was one of the best. I stayed there for two nights at the very end of my trip and was very pleased overall. This hotel was the most expensive of the four (though still very affordable) but it was worth every cent. LOCATION: As the name suggests, the hotel is located very close to the Plaza Mayor, but it鈥檚 far enough away so that you can鈥檛 really hear the noise from the Plaza itself. I was really happy with the location, as Plaza Mayor ended up being my favorite place to sit and people-watch. The hotel is only a few blocks from the Puerta Sol metro stop, which is great if you鈥檙e taking the metro to the airport. It鈥檚 also very easy to find if you鈥檙e arriving from the Atocha train station: once you exit the train station, you just stay on the same street all the way to the hotel (Be aware, however that it鈥檚 a slightly uphill walk from the train station to the hotel. If you have luggage, you might want to just hop in a cab).HOTEL: The hotel had a medium sized (rather quiet and peaceful) lobby that also served as a breakfast room. I didn鈥檛 have breakfast at the hotel, mainly because I wanted to sleep in. There is one computer in the lobby with Internet access, but I think they charge for the use of it. It was almost always in use. The connection is very slow apparently, so I just used the Internet caf茅 four blocks away. I had to go up a flight or two of stairs, then down two long hallways to get to my room. The hallways had lovely little couches and shelves that were simply overflowing with books 鈥?very nice if you wanted to relax, read, and take a short rest. One thing to know about the hotel: the lights in the hallways go off at night. It caught me by surprise when I walked out of my room on the first night, and it was pitch black - but my eyes quickly adjusted. I noticed that they do this in several hotels in Spain. Just know where the light switches are in the hallway and you鈥檒l be fine. STAFF: I encountered several different front desk clerks during my stay. For me, the staff at a hotel can make or break an experience and can determine whether or not I will stay there again. Almost all of the staff members at Hotel Plaza Mayor were very professional and friendly, and all of them spoke English. The night shift clerk spoke the least English, but he was very sweet and helpful when I attempted to speak Spanish. In the afternoon, a young man and an older woman were working at the front desk 鈥?they were amazing! The young man helped me plan my Metro route to the airport, drew maps, and downloaded information on the computer. And through it all, he was wonderfully patient and good-humored. The older woman who was working at the same time was also quite nice and had extremely helpful suggestions. I do have to add that at one point in the afternoon, there was a younger college-aged woman 鈥渨orking鈥?at the front desk who was obviously way too busy flirting with any men who happened to walk by to do her job: she literally ignored every single female guest who came to the front desk to ask for help (I watched this go on for a good 30 minutes). It would have been downright comical if it hadn鈥檛 been so blatantly rude. If I had dealt only with her, I wouldn鈥檛 have stayed there again - no matter how nice the hotel itself was. However, the other staff members were absolutely phenomenal, and my experiences with them more than made up for her behavior. Overall, everyone was very professional and the service was fantastic, so I would definitely stay there again.ROOM: I stayed in a double room with two single beds. It was nice to have the extra space of a double room for a change. Since I was packing for my return trip home, I used the second twin bed to lay out all my stuff and get organized. With regard to sleeping, the bed was very comfortable, with nice crisp sheets (Note: I鈥檓 5鈥?鈥漚nd 125 pounds, and the twin bed felt a bit too small for me鈥?so if you鈥檙e bigger than that, and you decide stay there, you might want to request a double bed). I also really liked the layout of the room. It had a huge sliding glass door, and there was a little patio outside. The sunlight filtered in softly, creating a very peaceful ambience. What else...I made good use of the safe, which I believe they charged for by the day. You have to pick up a key card and program your own code. Last of all: the shower was just wonderful.OVERALL: I liked this hotel the best because of the overall impression it left me with. The entire place was immaculate and modern, but at the same time, it was restful and welcoming. At the end of a two-week trip full of hustle and bustle, it felt like a quiet oasis where I could get my bearings and feel fully rested before the long flight home. I would definitely return. I can honestly say that it was the nicest place that I stayed at in Spain. LAST TIP: It鈥檚 cheaper if you book directly with the hotel via fax or email.

<Content>Great location, moderate provisions This was the last hotel on our wonderful 12 day trip through Southern Spain. The location is perfect, only several hundred feet from Plaza Mayor. The desk staff is very helpful. The room was somewhat cramped, although average by European standards. It also had a chemical cleaner smell to it, which was our biggest complaint. Good place for an overnight stay, but would not recommend for a prolonged visit.

<Content>Wonderful Gem in Madrid City Center The Hotel Plaza Mayor was an excellent value and I would recommend it to budget minded travelers . The staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke English well. The location was centrally located and within easy walking distance to the major attractions and the metro. We felt safe and comfortable and would not hesitate to stay here again. The rooms are simple and clean, bed, TV, bath, so if your looking for fancy this is not the place. But for price, safety, and convience it is well worth it. The breakfast served (additional cost) was very good.

<Content>Nice hotel, great rooms The Hotel Plaza Mayor was very easy to find with the directions off of their website. It was within 0.5 miles of the Puerta Sol metro stop. It is in a GREAT location. One block from Plaza Mayor, and a few blocks from Plaza Puerta Sol. Even though it's in a great location, the room was quiet with no outside noise.Our room (double) had a small balcony and a medium size bathroom with a tub/shower. You can set the a/c to whatever temperature you want. We did not pay extra for the breakfast and instead walked a few blocks to a bakery (for much less money). I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great Location - Great Price Just what you need to enjoy more time in Madrid. The location is perfect. About a 10 block walk from the Atocha rail station. (uphill to hotel...but downhill leaving). Right next to bus stop. 1 block from Plaza Mayor and two blocks from Plaza del Sol and Metro Sol...you can't get any better than that. Yet the price was absolutely inexpensive relative to the great location. Less than 100 Euros a night for a double. The rooms were clean. The hotel staff was nice and helpful. The breakfast was filling, including hot foods and cheaper than the Corner Cafe across the way. If you're looking for luxury, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a great deal...you've found it at Plaza Mayor.

<Content>Perfect for Us! What a great hotel for the price!!!! Location was perfect. Right near the Sol subway station. We could see Plaza Mayor from our room. We stayed in the Room directly over the flags. Second floor. Nice king bed. Great bathrom and shower. Not a lot of noise for being next to a street. Lots of things to do nearby. Staff was very helpful. This is a great find for us from searching the internet. We weren't expecting much but wow were we suprised when we arrived! Perfect place! Highly recommended. Very clean. Visit the nearby Museo De Hamon where tons of ham hocks are hanging on the walls and beer is great. Stop by the Plaza and eat free samples of cheese and taste the local wines.

<Content>So close, So nice..a Madrid must Do you like original art on the wall? Do you like a staff that seems more honest than corporate (they are not owned by any major chain). We spent five wonderful days in June. The price was great, the staff wonderful. We opted out of the breakfast which was extra--more fun to find something good on the streets--great pastries to be found not far. . The hotel is less than a block from Plaza Mayor--we walked down to the Palace and the park. Hotel is ideally located ( I know I sound like an ad I am not)It is an ideal location--we felt very safe. Rooms were fine. Try to get a streetside location you can look down to see some wonderful sights.Across the street is a subway stop,.WE toured Spain after our five days and wanted to store our luggage just using overnight bags. Worked perfect - 1 Euro a day. WE tried very hard to get back into the hotel when we returned to Madrid. Sorry but there was nothing. Book it early, book it often, book now!

<Content>Lively location and clean, comfortable rooms This hotel is in a great location--we walked to most of the sites, took the metro to the airport, and generally really enjoyed ourselves. The staff were really helpful and uniformly spoke great English. You can walk the streets and get a good feeling for several surrounding neighborhoods, complete with tapas and sites.We arrived very early (around 9am), and they had our room ready for us in about 15 minutes. They've got wireless access and low-fee internet access in the main lobby. Our room was 75 Euros a night, with a nice view of the Madrid rooftops from the 5th floor and a powerful little air conditioner that kept the room nice and cool, even in July. The rooms are small, but clean, and there's an elevator to get you and your luggage to the upper floors.The hotel is in an urban environment, and when we were checking out a pickpocket came in and tried to steal wallets from both my husband and a woman at the internet station, but the hotel staff and other customers were very vigilent and assertively drove him off, so disaster was averted! All part of the hotel's great location in a major city center....We felt very well cared for.

<Content>Good Value in Madrid This is a small, modest, clean hotel, very well located near the Plaza Mayor , for under 100 euros per night. Nothing fancy but all the basics are there and the rooms were very clean. We had a deluxe double for 95 euros. The only downside was that our room was in the front and a little noisy but not enough to be a real problem. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet is quite good at 7.50 euros.

<Content>In the of Old Madrid What a fabulous spot this was. Smack bang in the middle of old Madrid. We were able to walk to most of the sights we wanted to see and the main shopping area was a short stroll as well. Close to the main square in Madrid, we arrived on the eve of Good Friday and were treated to a wonderful Easter procession through the Plaza Mayor. The following day, another started right under our window. The colour, noise and spectacle was fabulous. Our room was spacious and the bathroom well equipped. We were on the first floor and heard some of the street noise (always take your earplugs with you!), however our friends were on the second floor and heard nothing. There was a lift, however we still needed to carry our luggage up some stairs. There were nice little sitting areas to meet with our friends for a drink. The cafe and bar were only open for breakfast, which was good value. The staff were friendly and hellpful and spoke good english.

<Content>Little Gem! I booked the Hotel Plaza Mayor after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed!I agree that it is in a great location and excellent value for money. The hotel was clean and the staff friendly  helpful.We stayed in a superior twin room, which was perfect for our short stay. It wasn't the biggest of rooms, however it was no smaller than some of the other hotels I have stayed in when in various european cities. The beds were comfortable and the room was well equipped.I liked the way the corridors were furnished; our floor also had a book exchange. The corridor had a carpet runner along the centre of the wooden flooring - great for cutting down the noise of footsteps from other guests returning late at night.When arriving in Madrid we took the metro from the airport to the centre of the city. The metro is fast, efficient and easy to use. We took Line 8 (pink line) to Colombia (4 stops), then changed to Line 9 (purple line) for Principe de Vergara (5 stops), then finally took Line 2 (red line) to Sol (4 stops). The whole journey cost just 2 euros. When exiting the metro you need to take the exit for Calle Mayor and follow the signs to Plaza Mayor. Once on the Plaza, head in the same direction as Felipe III's horse and you will see the sign of the hotel through one of the arches in the right corner.We had a great time in Madrid and I would like to go back.........and yes, I would definately stay in the Hotel Plaza Mayor!

<Content>Great Location, Excellent Value, Friendly/Helpful Staff I arrived into Madrid at 7:30 in the morning. Check-in isn't supposedto be until later in the day. The person who had my room, checked outwhile I waited in the lobby. The hotel staff made sure my room was cleaned out, and I was let into the room not long after my arrival. That is service! I walked into the room, and it is smaller than my bedroom. But, I was expecting that. Being a solo traveler, I didn't mind. However, the bathroom was extremely small. That was troublesome, especially when trying to take a shower, and exiting the shower. The shower is elevated from the ground. That was the only thing I could find wrong. The hotel was situated in a perfect location. I could walk anywhere. There was a bus stop right in front, plenty of taxis, and the subway was a 5 minute walk away. I tried the breakfast for 7.5 Euros on my last day. I should have had it on the first day. It is very good.

<Content>Can't beat location and price It's taken me some time to write this review, so forgive me. My husband and I stayed here in October 2006.PROS:LOCATION and PRICE. Can't be beat. You walk out your door and you are in the Plaza Mayor. Taxis are always available right outside of the hotel if needed, but you are centrally located to most everything.CONS:Tiny, tiny room. Could barely fit me, my husband (who is rather tall) and our luggage. The shower stall was pretty claustrophobia-inducing... kind of tight in there when trying to wash my hair, etc. Also, the hallway was really, really dark which we found kind of bizarre at first. I think it's on a sensor but it would take a little time to go on. A bit scary when first exiting the elevator. Lastly, we almost did not get to see the flamenco show that we wanted and it was the last night of our trip. The receptionist assured us that they made us a reservation, but when we got to the venue, we were not on the list. Luckily, there was one slot available as long as we weren't going to eat dinner. We weren't so we got lucky, but that was a bit disappointing. Oh, and though I am a New Yorker, I would have to say that Madrid never sleeps! The party went on all night long and so it was rather loud. The voices seemed to reverberate through the square. Bring earplugs if you get bothered by that.Overall, I would recommend this hotel because of its great location/price. Just don't plan on spending too much time in the room.

<Content>Great location and value though request room on upper floors We stayed in Hotel Plaza Mayor at the end of May. The hotel location cound not have been better in terms of accessing tourist spots and restaurants. I agree with other reviewers, we were on the 1st floor facing the street/plaza and the noise did wake us during our first 1 night. You can also hear noise from the corridor. So very light sleepers beware. However given the price and location I believe these can be over looked espically if you request a room on the top floor. I would definitely return again.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Location We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during our trip to Spain last May. Could not have made a better choice. The hotel is very clean and the location is excellent. You can walk to all the important places in less than 10 minutes. The subway station is also very close. The Plaza Mayor and Plaza del Sol are a few blocks away. We asked for a room in the top floor with a balcony and a view to the street, could not have asked for more. It was just great. Make sure you ask for this when you make your reservation, the extra bucks are worth it. Our friends got a very small room with no view and a very small shower. The front desk people moved them the next day to a much better room. The buffet breakfast was nice and not that pricey (7.50 euros) compared to other hotels we stayed at. I loved this hotel, it was definitelly one of the best we had. If you are looking for a 2 star hotel (felt more like a 3 star), don't look for anything else because the Hotel Plaza Mayor is the way to go you

<Content>Well Worth Staying My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Plaza for 4 nights at the end of April. The Hotel is very central to all the sites of interest. Very well kept Hotel run by very helpful staff. We took the breakfast offered at 7.50 euros each and felt it was well worth it to give us a good start to the day. You can buy breakfast outside but here you can top up on coffee and food as much as you like. Rooms vary in size and are very clean and maintained. Very reliable hot water and powerful shower. We tried a lot of Tapas but on the last night we went to a restaurant called Susanna, not very far. Staff can tell you where. Another one of the same group is Bazzar. It was a really good night out at a restaurant which is well priced , modern and had fantastic food. I would stay here on another visit for sure. If you like markets then make sure you have time on a Sunday to shop at the local flea market, really interesting stuff at great prices.... enjoy cao !! Babyk and Gabi

<Content>FIRST RATE We have just returned from a week at the Plaza Mayor and cannot rate it highly enough. Its location was perfect, the staff were helpful and friendly, our room facing out over the street was generously proportioned, surprisingly quiet, with an extremely comfortable bed and decent sized shower room. Breakfast each morning was just right and set us both up for a busy days' sightseeing. It goes without saying that the hotel was exceptionally clean and well decorated. This is a hotel which deserves its accolades and is absolutely unbeatable at the price. Looking forward to a return visit already!

<Content>Great Location, Great Price A recent comment was that there was nothing special about this hotel, and they are right - it is just a hotel. However, it is only a 3 minute walk from the Metro, and within walking distance to the major attractions in Madrid. The hotel is very clean, and it is one of the cheapest hotels you can book in Madrid. This is what makes it a great deal, even if there is nothing special otherwise to be said. We also found the rooms sizes vary greatly. The couple we traveled with had a room twice the size of ours (paid the same price) although we had a window view to the city, and they did not. The breakfast in the morning was also very good, with plenty of options, breads, fruits, juices, cereals, etc. I would not hesistate to stay here the next time I am in Madrid.

<Content>Tripadvisor does it again! Just got back from a three night stay at the Plaza Mayor and the hotel was every bit as good as the vast majority of the reviews on Tripadvisor suggested. Excellent location, friendly and welcoming staff on reception, immaculately clean throughout and extremely reasonable prices (60 euros a night for a single plus another 7 for breakfast).I'm not suggesting that it's faultless - the rooms we stayed in weren't the biggest ever (although I thought they were perfectly adequate for a short stay and let's face it, who wants to go to a city like Madrid and stay in their hotel room?) and I can imagine that some guests who are on the larger side might find it a bit of a squeeze getting into the (fantasically powerful) shower I had in my room. The breakfast was good rather than historic but there was plently of it, with a wide choice of the usual cold meats and cheeses, yogurts, pastries etc plus hot items like scrambled egg, bacon and sausage and good coffee so I'd say it represented value for money. As far as the question of noise which some others have commented on I can only speak for myself and I thought it was one of the quietest hotels I've stayed in with no noticable street noise despite the location (once I remembered to close the window!). Yes, the cleaning staff come around doing the rooms at about 9.00 am but I wouldn't describe them as noisy or disruptive.Just a word on two of the restaurant recommendations we were given by the lovely female receptionist on our first morning. We visited La Gloria de Montera on the Calle Caballero de Gracia and Bazaar on the Calle de la Libertad (I think they're part of the same chain and we found both to be absolutely first-rate with very tasty modern (but unpretentious) dishes, great staff and a brilliant atmosphere. Both places get full early, mainly with locals, and you can't reserve so I'd suggest getting there early..... you won't regret it!Overall we all agreed that the Hotel Plaza Mayor was probably one of the best places we'd stayed at during our regular trips abroad - personally I'd say that the standard was higher than than in many 3* and even 4* hotels I've been to, it's amazingly good value and I'd go back and stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Perfect Location We arrived at the hotel on 3 April and stayed for 4 nights. Check in was quick and straight forward and the staff were helpful and friendly (their English was better than my Spanish).We booked the rooftop 'Suite Del Palomar' which had great views over the city and was very quiet.The inside of the hotel was modern and in good condition and the housekeeping staff cleaned our room each day, changed the towels and left fresh toiletries. As it was very cold and wet during our stay we opted for breakfast a few times. The buffet was pretty good value with a choice of cold meats, tortilla, pastries, fruit cerial, bread and coffee. The hotel couldn't be better placed for visiting the main attractions around the city centre. The Plaza Mayor was about 50 yards away and the 3 main museums around a 10-15 minute leisurely walk. Puerto del Sol was less than a 5 minute walk and a further 5 minutes to Gran Via and onto Malasana and Chueca.Some other reviewers have criticised the hotel, but taking into account the location, the price and the helful staff (and it is only 2 star) I don't think it would be possible to get better value for money. Unless your looking for luxury, I would thoroughly recommend staying here for a city break.

<Content>A Wonderful Hotel My friend and I just returned from a week long visit to Madrid, and stayed for our first time at the Hotel Plaza Mayor. Contrary to the former two reviews, the Hotel Plaza Mayor was wonderful!! Upon arriving, we were greeted by the very friendly and helpful staff. In fact, during our entire stay the receptionists were a fount of information, giving us restaurant and sightseeing tips, as well as having a good command of the English language, since neither of us speak Spanish.Allowing us to have an early check in, we found our room, and were pleasantly surprised at it's size. We have stayed in hotels in Europe, where the rooms were of much smaller size than here. We had an inside room, with a door to a small courtyard, which was extremely quiet. The only noise we ever heard was the charming ringing of a church bell nearby. The room itself was immaculate, lovely wooden floors, and a large and spotless bathroom. Another positive was the price of the room, which we received for about 90 Euros per night, a great bargain in a city that is becoming more and more expensive.I believe the visitor to Madrid would be hard pressed to find a hotel more convenient that the Hotel Plaza Mayor. It is located on the lovely Plaza de Santa Cruz, and so close to the Plaza Mayor that the statue of Philip III is within a few meters. It is a short 15 minutes walk to the Royal Palace and the Prado, and the famous Rastro market is around the corner. The Metro is nearby, and taxicabs are plentiful.A write once wrote that a traveler should always assume that he will return. I will return to Madrid someday, and will not hestitate to stay at this charming hotel. It is highly recommended.

<Content>Agree with Dublin Honeymooners I've just come back from a weekend in Madrid and I agree with the previous review.The best thing about the hotel is it's location - nothing is far away and with Madrids excelent metro system it is very easy to get to anywhere. However, we had a double room which was small. The walls were thin, we could hear the cleaner hoovering every morning and running water from other people's rooms. We didn't have breakfast any morning that we stayed there but to be honest it didn't look that good - a few trays of cheese and ham, bread and dry cerial. I would go back to Madrid but not to this hotel. It's cheep and it's very central but other than that - there's nothing.

We could hear everything from the corridor, especially the cleaners. I assume everything from your room can be heard also, not great for a romantic weekend!!When we asked for restaurant recommendations, we were pointed to a general area...not exactly a personal serviceThere was a loud noise whenever we put on our taps (same from next door)I love Madrid and cant recommend highly enough. been there three times and will be back, but I wont come back to Hote Plaza Major despite its great location.

<Content>Brilliant little discovery in the heart of Madrid I can only concur with what everyone says about this great little hotel. Staff are very friendly and it provides exactly what I wanted - simple, clean accommodation at a very reasonable price.Location is first class - particularly for visiting El Rastro market on Sundays, which I strongly recommend.During my visit I also stayed for a couple of nights at a supposedly glamorous 5 star hotel nearby where the noise was much worse than it was at the Plaza Mayor.Maybe it's as a result of its high Trip Advisor rating, but all the guests seemed friendlier than usual, too!

<Content>Pluses outweigh minuses, amazing location The Hotel Plaza Mayor is a great value in an amazing touristy location.It is a half-block away from Plaza Mayor, 5 minutes or so from Sol, and walk-able to everywhere (from Palacio Real to Prado / Sofia), easily accessible from the airport. I stayed there in Jan. 07 for 60 euro a night, a good bargain imho. There are lots of places to eat nearby, I esp. liked a bakery on C. Mayor (La Mallorquina) and a chain restaurant called Cerveceria 100 Montaditos (near Sol, also on C. Mayor).In response to other reviewers. I was able to check in early (off season). I didn't have any problems with the heat, it was perfect. I didn't have any problems with the lighting, but I can see why someone would complain. Noise, as mentioned by others, can be a problem. If it's really loud outside, you can be bothered, but the street noises weren't that bad to me. In some rooms (like mine), the pipes can be very loud, i.e. you can be startled by your neighbor turning on their sink. The room was small, but still a bargain given the location / price, I think.The hotel staff was super, as were their email responses. There's a vending machine (a big plus to me) in the lobby as well as internet access for a small fee. There are several groceries nearby, and a supermarket near Sol in Corte Ingles (basement) and a real market down near Plaza d'Villa (on Mayor).All in all, a great bargain. May not be the place for a special occasion (i.e. honeymoon). The pluses outweigh the minuses.Oh, their contact info is info@h-plazamayor.com.

<Content>brilliant Stayed at the Plaza Mayor for New Year 2007. It is a relatively small hotel but it was a wonderful place to stay due to its very friendly and helpful staff and its fantastic location which is minutes walk from some of Madrid鈥檚 principal attractions.Although the rooms are small, they are very comfortable and the shower is one of the most powerful I've ever come across. My only complaint is that the cleaners start cleaning rooms quite early and they can be noisy, as each of them has a loud walkie-talkie.I had the 鈥榩leasure鈥?of being in the New Years Eve Madrid 10km run鈥?with 20,000 other people. Having done a number of big events including the Great North Run I can tell you that this is a fantastic run to enter. It begins from the Bernabau Stadium at 6pm and goes past every key building and monument. And allows one to see all the city鈥檚 xmas decorations which are beautiful and stretch throughout Madrid. The local support for the runners was amazing all the way along..The Plaza Sol is less than 3 minutes walk from the hotel and it is the centre of the city. New Years eve in the plaza will never be forgotten. Lighting and heating were both fine. Also we got a fantastic deal of 280 Euros for 3 nights鈥︹€?try and match that over New Year..I CAN THOROUGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL

Heater not warm enough and we woke up mid of the night. The only complement is the location, just few steps away from Plaza Mayor, about 5 minutes walking to Sol metro station and main street.

<Content>Great, great, great! I went to Madrid for the tennis in early November with some friends, we chose this hotel because it was close to the stadium and the reviews here were really good. Some of us stayed for the whole week, others just for a couple of days but I guess I can speak for all of them by saying we had a great time!The location is very central, just in the heart of Madrid, at walking distance to a couple of metro stations in two different lines (Opera and Sol), as well as the museums (Prado, Thyssen, Reina Sofia). I was there from Wednesday to Sunday. I booked a single room online with 2 months advance whilst we organized the meeting up and everything was as planned. When I arrived they gave me a double room and asked me to move to a single the next morning, which I did without a problem. The double was a 1st floor room with a huge window to the main street. It wasn't a problem for me but for those who are noise-sensitive, you may prefer a room located on the back as it was the single room I had for the other 3 nights. Both rooms were imaculated clean, the bed was nice, the bathrooms both had great showers, just all I needed!I can't say good enough of the staff! There was a little problem with our tickets for the tennis and one of my friends (who also stayed at the hotel) asked them if they could pick up the tickets at the stadium for us, which they kindly did without charging us any extra fee. All I can say is Much铆simas Gracias and we'll be back next year!

<Content>Great Location, Friendly Staff! We had a superior room, which afforded us a front room overlooking the square. For the cost 90 Euros per night, we thought this was excellent value. The room was clean, the staff very friendly and the location superb.We had breakfast a couple of days in the hotel, but also liked La Mallorqina on Puerto Del Sol - you could sit upstairs and watch the world go by. The croissants were excellent.We went by train from Atocha Station (20 minute walk) to Toledo and Segovia during our week's stay. If you are thinking of doing this, the station has a wonderful botanical garden inside, handy when you have missed your train, due to the extremely long waits for train tickets. Allow at least half an hour to buy a ticket!Wnet to the Prado, Thyssen, Palacio Real, Naval Museum and Railway Museum - all excellent. Went to Reina Sofia, apart from Dali a waste of time for me, too abstract.

<Content>Great little Hotel Plaza Mayor Just returned from a weekend here. Very central location, only a few steps from the Plaza Mayor itself, and a short walk from the nearest metro at Sol (we flew into Barajas T4, just under 1 hour from landing to arriving at hotel, with the connecting bus between termini (?) taking a fair bit of that time). A clean, small but well equipped room and very helpful and friendly receptionists  night porter. We followed their recommendations for places to eat out and were not disappointed. A comprehensive (for such a small hotel) hot and cold buffet breakfast is available - and at only 鈧?.50 each, a bargain. If you like a firm bed, room 305 certainly had one, together with a view out on to Calle Atocha. Usual city noise out on the street, but the closed windows eliminated most of that. There is no heavy passing traffic (as in say Gran Via), just local stuff, although the fire station and police HQ were nearby, so there were a few sirens about.

<Content>Wonderful Location and Price! We stayed at the Plaza Major for the first two nights of our trip to Spain and couldn't have been more satisfied. Our room, #403, was a large, corner room with two large double french door windows looking out to the plaza below. The room was immaculate, the bed very comfortable and the bathroom large by European standards. Unlike other reviewers, we did not hear anything from other guests and heard only a little from the street (perhaps because we were higher up). The staff spoke excellent English and were very accomodating. I e-mailed them to request they make a reservation for us at Casa Botin and they replied when they did. We paid $7.50 euros apiece for breakfast, but it was fresh, varied and plentiful. We found that to be about the price at all of the hotels that we stayed in and Plaza Major's was the best buffet that we found. Oh, and the location was great! Close to lots of restaurants and tapas!! Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Just fine! I called this hotel from the states before leaving. They agreed to keep my one small suitcase for me in locked storage while I traveled around the country for 2 weeks with my backpack. The hotel was very quiet and very clean. The room was quite small, but since I was hardly ever in it, I didn't mind this. The only problem I had was minor. The floor of the shower was extremely slick. I was so afraid that I would slip and fall. I suggested that they put a mat on the floor, but the desk clerk felt that it would not be sanitary. The location was very good. It was very close to the Atocha entrance to the underground and near restaurants. There is also a busy bar in this hotel.I think what I liked best here was that the staff spoke excellent English and was extremely helpful. For example, they helped me make future hotel reservations for my next stop by phone. I am planning to go back to Spain next fall and will definitely book my stay here before I leave home.

<Content>Wouldn't Stay Here Again We stayed at this hotel for two nights. It was the last hotel of our trip and it was the worst. We researched all our hotels on TripAdvisor and this was the only major disappointment. Perhaps the low cost of the room (in a major city) should have been a give-away. We reserved a superior twin room. It's hard to believe that the room was a superior room.... I wonder what a standard room looks like. The room was drab, the lighting was poor (although there were several light fixtures), the furniture looked cheap, and the view was into a narrow, dark courtyard with other windows 10 - 15 feet away. The walls were paper thin. I did pass by a couple of rooms that were being cleaned that looked much nicer. These were painted white, had bright covers on the beds, and looked airy. They had large windows that faced the street. I'm sure I would have had a different opinion of the hotel had we had one of these rooms. On the plus side, the room we had was clean and the bathroom was fine. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. A male receptionist recommended a very good, reasonably priced restaurant that served non-traditional Spanish food. (By the time we arrived in Madrid, we were ready for something different to eat.) We loved the restaurant. It's called Finca de Susana. It's a good-looking restaurant with white table cloths, reasonable prices and Madrilenos as customers (English menus are available.) The food is eclectic. It was a fairly short walk from the hotel.

<Content>Great location and value Hi, I stayed in this hotel in Feb. Location is excellent and it is right beside the fabulous Plaza Mayor. Walking distance of numerous tapas bars, sights, galleries and shopping areas (but avoid the restaurant tourist traps on Plaza Mayor itself). Had a meal at Boitin, the oldest restaurant in Madrid - a real treat! Hotel is very comfortable, not top of the range but perfect for a city break and staff are very helpful and pleasant. Another fab restaurant is Teatrix, designed by Philip Starck so the decor is an added attraction. Don't miss the Prado

<Content>Very Average Madrid Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Plaza Mayor for 4 nights in September. I was really looking forward to our stay from all the positive reviews on this site. We had booked a superior room, paying 10 euro extra believing we would have a larger room. I had also e-mailed the hotel directly and asked for a room with a view in the hopes of getting a room like those pictured with lots of windows. The room we received was nothing like those described here. It was very small, on the first floor ( second floor to Americans), and had one window with a view of the brick wall across the street. The two twin beds were pushed up against the walls with about 2 feet of space between them. There was a modular nightstand in between the beds, so they could not be pushed together as is standard in most European hotels. We did not ask to change rooms as we were tired from travelling all day and had unpacked when it settled in on how small our quarters were. On the bright side, the bathroom was sufficient in size, and the shower had excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water. The room was cleaned daily, and was spotless. We took the buffet breakfast one morning and it was quite filling and tasty. The desk staff though seemed quite bored with their jobs, and were not really friendly. Also it should be noted that although the hotel uses electronic key cards, they are attached to a huge metal weight, so you must leave your key at the front desk when leaving the hotel. Overall, I can't say I would stay here again. There are plenty of alternative hotels and hostals in the neighborhood that offer the same size rooms for half the price. And for 10~20 Euro more a night you can have a nice hotel.

<Content>Plaza Mayor was a good deal and location! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in August - We had a very nice stay and recommend it to others looking for a clean hotel, nice bathroom, and good location for sightseeing!We arrived at Barajas airport and took the metro to the Sol Station (3 changes  45 mins) for a couple of euros. Then we walked to the hotel by going through the actual Plaza Mayor diagonally and found our hotel on a corner. We had easy access to all of the museums by 10-15 min walk on foot and found plenty of food close by. Best of the trip was finding Retiro Park 10 min from the hotel on foot and spending the day on a boat relaxing. Also, the Atocha train station was 15 min on foot, so we took a high speed train to Toledo as a side trip.The hotel itself was clean and staff were friendly. They are on duty 24 hrs/day and buzz you in after dark. The hotel is quaint, with some charm. We didn鈥檛 realize there was an elevator initially but there is one and it helps when you are on the 4th floor. Our room was extremely clean and equipped with the essentials 鈥?Beds were firm, as was to be expected. Air conditioning worked very well. The bedroom was plain, but the bathroom was updated, modern, and very clean! The towels were always fresh and were big. We were pleased that the water was hot and the water pressure could be set anywhere from low to peel off skin high. Breakfast isn't included but you could purchase the buffet in the lobby for 8 euros if you were hungry; otherwise, there were cheap coffee/pastry alternatives within 5 mins of the hotel.

<Content>Value for money The hotel is very clean and the location is excellent. This makes up for the small size of the rooms. If you want to work, there is a drawback in that there is no point to plug in the laptop near the writing desk (at least not in the room in which I stayed). This, of course, holds good for most of the hotels of this category, and is a minor point which the hotels should take care of. Staff are friendly. Wireless network is available in the lobby free of charge, although I could not connect during my stay. Would stay there again.

<Content>A Great Find I found this hotel in a New York Times article about travelling in Europe on a budget. Housed in a beautiful old house, this hotel has been magnificently renovated with all the modern conveniences. The rooms were spotless, featured new beds, furniture and bedding, laminate flooring and large well appointed bathrooms. The AC worked great - which was a blessing considering the 35+ degree heat and the fact I had just spent a week in London where air conditioning seems not to have been invented yet. The walls were thin enough to hear movement in the hallways, but I never heard noise from other rooms, nor was there any noise from the street. Another nice touch was the complimentary postcards which featured a photo of the hotel building taken at the turn of the 20th century. The staff was friendly (all spoke english too), the snack and drink machine in the lobby was handy and the over-priced internet was useful (walk a few blocks to puerta del sol and you can find any number of internet cafes that charge half as much). For 50 euros a night for a double room (albeit during the hotel's low august season) this hotel was a steal. Im surprised after being featured in the new york times it wasnt booked solid. Moreover, the location is perfect, the Plaza Mayor right outside the door, and within walking distance (about two blocks) to Puerta del Sol, the centre of Madrid. I'd definately stay here again.

<Content>Would you risk staying at Spain's Fawlty Towers? Avoid this hotel if you can ... or test it if you are prepared to pay for more than you get. We ended up in the penthouse suite in 30 degrees centigrade with a malfunctioning air conditioning system. When we tried to negotiate a reasonable discount the hotel manager called the police. It鈥檚 amazing how a furious hotel manager (Basil!) can make you change your mind about an entire city and country. The nine (!) policemen were nice and polite, but we still had to pay full price. Next year we are going back to Italy, or maybe Portugal!

<Content>Ideal Location Stayed at the hotle for 2 nights as part of a larger tour of Spain. The location was absolutely perfect. You are just away from the corner of the Plaza Mayor and within walking distance (when not in mid summer heat!) of most major attractions within Madrid. The rooms are basic but clean - but to be honest you won't spend much time in your room. We did not have breakfast here which is extra as there are plenty of places serving very good breakfasts all around the hotel. There are vending machines in the Hotel lobby which provide 24 hour access to snacks and bottled water which is very handy.On a night out you do not need to go on the metro as most restaurants and bars/clubs are within 10 mins walk away. There is security on 24 hours so you just need to press a buzzer to get back in. We would definitely stay here again if we go back to Madrid.

<Content>A great spot This is a good find. Right in the heart of Madrid, a few steps from Plaza Mayor and a really cheap cab ride from the train station. It has been beautifully renovated and if you feel like climbing the stairs you can see some fascinating old photos of Madrid. The rooms are a nice size and spotless. The bathroom was pretty spacious for big city Europe standards, and like the bedroom very newly redone. The staff were really helpful and very friendly. And there is internet -- albeit overpriced -- in the lobby which is terrifically convenient for those last minute flight checks. We only spent two nights in Madrid and so really haven't gotten the feel of the city fully, but I'm looking forward to staying here again next time. It's hard to get a better deal (76E) in the centre of town.

<Content>Perfect Location!!! I stayed at the Hotel Plaza Mayor the last week of May and truly enjoyed my time there. One could not ask for a better location and the staff is very helpful. The rooms are microscopic and the shower is a sight in itself, but they are very clean and neatly arranged. I will stay there again.

<Content>Great for the price After reading the previous reviews here, we decided to book at the Plaza Mayor. We stayed for 5 nights in June 2006 and were very pleased with the hotel. The location is awesome, near many restaurants, shops and the metro station Sol is only a short walk from the hotel. The rooms are on the small side, but with private bathroom and both are super clean. Even though they said there is no internet access on the rooms (only in the lobby), we were able to connect with the wireless card from our room on the second floor. The satff is friendly and helpful. Overall a great value for the price.

<Content>cute, clean, great location We stayed in a small double room during May and had a great time. The room was cozy and very pleasant, and I was particularly pleased with the sparkling clean bathroom. With windows open in our room and the bathroom we stayed quite cool during the day, and the panes were thick enough to block out all the hollering in the streets on a Friday night. The staff was excellent, and the location was close to lots of good restaurants, the metro, and interesting streets.

<Content>great value This is small, beautiful hotel in a perfect location at a very reasonable price. The rooms are smallish but beautifully decorated and absolutely spotless. They have individual air conditioning, in-room safes, and marble bathrooms. We were on the fifth floor with a great view and the double-glazed windows kept it quiet. The staff are very friendly and speak excellent English, and the breakfast buffet is surprisingly varied and good value for money. Of course, this is not a five-star hotel and it doesn't have some amenities you might be used to from North American hotels, e.g., no ironing board  iron in the room (a small one can be borrowed), no in-room internet access, few coat hangers, no refrigerator, and the towels aren't exactly soft and plush. Still, an excellent choice for a vacation in central Madrid!

<Content>Plaza Mayor Hotel, Great value! We would only be in Madrid for two nights, so wanted a hotel close to Plaza Mayor as a base for easy walking between sights.Impressed by all the reviews, even ones complaining about small bedrooms or no view etc.By looking at candid photos and emailing hotel several times found out that rooms ending in 03 are on the corner of Hotel over the front door, with a good view over Plaza Santa Cruz.Requested one of these rooms and checked into 503, nice and high. Simply furnished with nice wooden floor, the room had opening french windows on corner of room which made room very airy.Bathroom was clean with good shower over bath and came with usual freebies.Note, street cleaners start at 0500.Staff very friendly and most spoke good English.Good variety of hot/cold food at breakfast.Totally agree with other reviewers about Metro. Airport to Sol for 1 Euro each! Easy to navigate with coloured and numbered lines, although with heavy bags some of the station changes with stairs are a bit awkward at peak times.Recommend Walking Tours of Spain, fantastic food and wine walking tour of three historic pub/winebar/restaurant locations with great food/booze at each. Host Andres perfect English and impecable manners made for a fantastic night, all within 10 mins walk of Hotel.Coming backto hotel in July with 12 year old daughter en route to Costa Del Sol.As we could not fault Hotel in any way would thoroughly recommend hotel to anyone wanting central hotel at reasonable prices, but do check what room you're going to get.

<Content>Clean, helpful and friendly Myself, husband and 2 year old child stayed here for 2 nights. The room we had was very clean and of a reasonable size, we had a double bed and a cot. The room itself was on the corner of the building therefore having 3 windows, great view on to the square in front of hotel. Great for having a nosey and people spotting. But what made this hotel extra special was the location very handy for metro, cafes/restaurants/bars. Seconds from Plaza Mayor which was charming. And also the staff. The front desk was open 24 hours and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Very friendly to my son and gave us advice on the metro and where to eat near the hotel. Also offered to help us with some lost property we had left on a local train, offering to phone railway station as we could not speak spanish, really lovely.I would definately stay here again. Small and friendly hotel....fantastic.

<Content>Excellent location and great value for your money The hotel is in a fantastic location and is excellent value for money. The rooms whilst smallish are perfectly adequate, and the hotel offers car parking which is also excellent value for money in Madrid. If I ever return to Madrid I would happily stay at this hotel and I will recommend it to others. Our only complaint was that the cleaners started to hoover outside out bedroom (room 109) at 9.00 every morning. If we'd been out very late (as most of madrid is) this would have been far too early.

<Content>A really great place to stay in Madrid Just back from Madrid. A beautiful city and this is a great place to stay when you're there. Really central location - loads to see and do nearby and plenty places to eat and drink.We were there on the public holidays of 1st and 2nd May so there was no traffic around the hotels on those days but it wasn't a problem.The hotel was very clean, the staff helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. Breakfast buffet looked nice although we didn't eat there, choosing one of the many alternatives nearby for a bit of variety.We stayed in a superior room at the very reasonable rate of 90 Euros a night (Room 203) right above the front door of the hotel. No problems with noise except for me snoring!If you're looking for a luxury hotel to stay inside in in Madrid, this is a poor choice. If you want a great central location for a hotel to have a shower and a sleep before seeing the city, you will struggle to find better.We booked direct with the hotel by phone as the website at --- didn't show availability - but it was there!A few tips on Madrid.....Don't use taxis - use the metro - a taxi to the hotel from the airport cost us 30 Euros. With a bit more confidence we took the metro for a Euro each!Take the Madrid Vision bus tour - 2 days is really good value at 19 euros each - once you have your bearings, then the city is east to explore on foot or by combination of bus and metro.

<Content>Good but small As a Christmas present our children sent us to Madrid, Spain for a long weekend break at the end of April 2006. We stayed at the Hotel Plaza Mayor which was ideally located in the centre of Madrid, just outside the famous Plaza Mayor itself.The hotel was very clean and the staff were both friendly and always helpful. The breakfast buffet was good with a wide choice food, cereals, meat, cheeses and fruit etc with a cooked breakfast of scrambled eggs and bacon also being available.Our standard hotel double room 108 on the first floor was clean but extremely small with no chair, one bedside cabinet and a single wardrobe. The comfortable bed was a three quarter size bed and the pillows were very small.The shower room was also modern, very clean but again small.The air conditioning unit did not seem to be very effective even on its lowest setting, how it would perform on a really hot day I am not sure. We had to leave the window open when the temperature was only 24 degrees.It was very difficult to tell whether or not it was daytime or nightime as the window faced a wall and it was hard to see any sky, the room lights always had to be switched on.The cost of this doulble room was 79 euros per night.We did look into other rooms which were much bigger and some were very spacious but none were available as it was the bank holiday weekend. When booking a room at the Hotel Plaza Mayor make sure you ask about the room size, the air conditioning unit and the view from the window.

<Content>Our room was good but others were not equal We were happy with our stay at the Hotel Plaza Mayor. We selected it based on other good internet reviews and were not disappointed. We got exactly what we wanted here, clean, good location and moderate price. We did not want to pay extra for luxury like big screen TV, swimming pools, granite, marble and fluff. If you want a resort look elsewhere but if you want to sight see until you drop and have a decent place at decent price stay here. The location is very good in the heart of old town. It is within walking distance of the Sol station subway, shopping, tourist bus, Cava Baja and many interesting sights. We enjoyed 3 large floor to ceiling windows two of which offered a great view of the interesting streets below. Front desk staff spoke great english and were very friendly and positive. Note that the rooms vary significantly, we saw some that were very small with no view and we heard of others that were great. Small but clean and presentable lobby with small restaurant we never tried because there are so many other choices near by. The tour bus Madrid Vision was a good way to see the city, the subway was easy to figure out, the train to Toledo was a good day trip experience. Watch your wallet, a guy tried to pickpocket me on the subway. Hit the Tapas bars in on Cava Baja, soak up some music, you really feel like you are in Spain here.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed for 6 nights from March 26th in Room 103 on the first floor. Room was spacious, comfortable with a good size bathroom. Also had the use of a fridge and a safe. Overlooking an alley with side window looking onto a square - very quiet. The staff were more than helpful in providing advice about restaurants, shopping and directions. Would like to thank Mathias and Fedra for all their help. Hotel was central, in a safe district and most things were within walking distance. We did not eat here, but would recommend the Taberna restaurant, nearby in Plaza San Anna (about 10 min walk away). Fillet steak for two was a great choice and prawns were nice too. Also, the Lazarran tapas bar was brilliant - a short away in Latin Quater. We're a couple in our 60's and found this hotel perfect for our short stay. Would definitely stay again!

<Content>Great place and fantastic friendly staff I am not the sort of person who likes being fussed over,and generally like the impersonality of larger establishments. However, I have had to revise my opinion after our 4 night stay here. The staff all spoke excellent English, and more importantly all gave the distinct impression of wanting to make the stay of their guests an enjoyable one. We were lucky enough to have the Palomar Suite (FAB if you can book it!),but it had been prebooked the 4th night, and the staff were very solicitous, both beforehand by email (always responded to quickly and fully),and during our stay re: choice of room for final night.A few pointers- if you are sensitive to noise (we are) then request a room not facing the square, as a road runs right alongside- we got a nice quiet rm.Breakfast is modest, but excellent value for the price, and the coffee good and strong. We arrived after midnight the first night and the only place open nearby was a (licensed, sells wine)fast food establishment (can't recall exact name but it was a stone's thro, turn right out of hotel, on the corner of the first square+ take yr Spanish phrase bk!Altho not regular pizza eaters, we had a first rate freshly cooked pizza there(the 'pequena'(small) is more than enough for two people! The salad was basic, but we returned later in the week for another pizza, also fried squid, again, all v hot, freshly cooked and delivered to our pavement table in 20 mins. V gd value, but don't expect black tie service!

<Content>Book the Attic!!! Based on the ratings in Trip Advisor and the comments regarding the upstairs attic room (room 600), we booked three nights this past week (130 Euros per). As noted, the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable (saved us a trip to the airport for returning our rental car). The attic room is unusual in its design, and there is plenty of room. The balcony however, is what made this room special. Overlooking all the old rooftops, and occasionally hearing the sound of the accordion players near the Plaza Mayor, made this memorable. The hotel's location is very convenient for walking and public transportation is excellent and safe. You can鈥檛 book it on line, but the Hotel鈥檚 web site (h-plazamayor[--]) has pictures (look for the attic room 鈥?Suite del Palomar).

<Content>Brilliant value for money This is fairly typical average/low-average hotel but with a brilliant location and EXCELLENT value for money, when compared with other hotels in Madrid. We paid just 79 euros/night for a double via alpharooms(-) and were very pleased. The desk staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The room we styed in was tiny but everything was adequate. So if you are coming for a cheeky weekend away were you really are mostly looking for somewhere clean, safe and central to stay, then this comes highly recommended. Yeah, the shower cubicle was tiny, and the water is scalding at times, but if you just adjust it before getting in it's fine (which my boyfriend found out the hard way :-) ) It's suprisingly quiet in the area considering it's location. Earlier in the week had stayed in a more upmarket hotel (Senator Gran Via) and at nearly twice the price and a great tripdavisor rating the staff weren't nearly as friendly and it is on a street lined with prostitutes.... whereas the square outside this hotel is quiet and the approach feels quite safe.Definately go for it if you are on a bit of a budget.

<Content>Only one criticism I stayed in a single room for two weeks while on a course, and agree with other posts that this is a good, central hotel in an excellent position, with very pleasant and helpful staff. The single rooms are quite small, although comfortable enough and clean(I had just enough space to work on my laptop). For the price it is really excellent value. I would make only one criticism. The water is very hot, the shower cubicle is very small. It is very easy to knock the hot water to maximum. The water is then scalding hot - there is nowhere to go: you have to reach through the water for the tap or to get out! OK when you know the problem, but I don't think it would pass the health and safety test in the UK. This may only apply to the single rooms though. There is no restaurant, but the breakfasts are good, no fresh fruit juice being my only complaint, and you can always go across the square for a change.I would certainly book here again.

Being Madrid, the morning traffic (which you'd get everywhere) was the only noise offense for me (of coarse this was at like 12 noon). The staff was friendly and knowledgable. Room very clean and standard sized for Europe. The bathroom was quite large and clean.

Centrally located, Hotel Plaza Mayor is convenient to the many bars and restaurants which are within minutes of the hotel and also the metro (Sol) to get around the city.Service in the hotel was friendly and helpful. Our double room (on the 4th floor) was small but was very clean and quiet and the hotel is now totally non-smoking which was a pleasant surprise.We didn鈥檛 eat breakfast in the hotel, but there are loads of great places nearby which are likely to be much better values for money than the 7.50 Euro the hotel charges.

<Content>Utterly disappointed, unimaginable customer service My wife and I went to Madrid for a 4-day vacation last week and had booked Hotel Plaza Mayor over the internet after reading the reviews here and a couple of other sites. We had given our credit card details and everything over email. The hotel room was great infact. It was a corner room with three windows facing three different streets. Of course, we were hardly in the room to enjoy the view since we left early and returned late.The problem was that on the third day while we were away, they checked us out. We went out in the morning after having breakfast in the hotel and handing over the keys to the front desk. When we came back at 8pm in the night, the front desk tells us that we were checked out since we hadn't given the checkout date and the hotel was booked completely. Now, I do remember that we had requested for only 2 days over email initially but when we actually checked-in we had told them that we will stay for 4 nights since we didn't plan to go to another city. And now they told us that all of our stuff had been moved out of the room. They had even opened the safe and removed the wallet, purse and laptop from there. What more? They opened our bags to keep the other stuff on the table and bathroom inside the bags. I simply cannot understand how can a hotel check someone out like this? We gave the keys in the morning before starting to eat breakfast. Nobody said anything. They had our credit card. We had our stuff in the room, so they could definitely not assume that we will not pay for that night.Stay away from the hotel. After ensuring that nothing was missing from the luggage, my wife and I had to lug around the stuff in a light drizzle to find a hotel. Highly disappointed and would never stay there inspite of the fact that the location is good and the room was quite nice.

<Content>Great location and good value for money We stayed in the Hotel Plaza Mayor at the start of Feb 2006, having read all the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor.The hotel is extremely well situated in the centre of the main tourist area (Plaza Mayor  Sol). Taxi from the airport was 25 Euro including airport surcharge. As recommended by other reviewers, we booked the Palomar Suite (room 600). Standard rate was 130 Euro but they took a last minute offer of 110. It麓s right at the top of the hotel, in the rafters, and has a great terrace overlooking the city. Although it was too cold to spend much time out there, it would be amazing in the spring or summer.The room itself was clean and in good condition, although would say that the bed was a little hard for our tastes.The staff were very helpful and all spoke good english.We would definitely go back if we found ourselves in Madrid, but dont think that it麓s quite the 5 star experience that some of the other reviewers have given.

<Content>Excellent Choice for Madrid Tourist We chose this hotel from the previous Tripadvisor reviews, and the reviews were right on target. It was the only budget hotel that did not have any negative Tripadvisor reviews. What we found is that this hotel is a real gem and great value for the money. I travel a lot for business and generally stay in 4 or 5 star hotels. When traveling with my family to Europe using multiple rooms, we try to find a lower cost hotel. I would match this hotel up with any 4-star hotel for most amenities.The hotel is immaculately clean, the service from the English-speaking front desk is top-shelf, and the location is ideal for touring Madrid. The hotel is very quiet even though it is within 100 yards of the Plaza Mayor, the center of Old Madrid. Special thanks to Anucha at the front desk for all of her concierge advice! Some tips...1-The Metro is only 400 meters away (Sol station), safe, very clean and easy to use. Most of the major tourist sites are within 3 kilometers of the hotel. For anything not walkable, I'd recommend using the Metro except for the airport. To or from airport, you can get a taxi for $21-25. 2-We did not eat at the hotel due to the large number of good, inexpensive alternatives within 2 blocks in any direction. However, the hotel buffet looked very good.3-The standard double rooms are quite small. We took 2 superior doubles for our family of four and found them to be fine for size.This was our first visit to Madrid and we loved it. We found it to be very sophisticated, cultured, active, clean and safe. Also, reasonable cost compared to other major cities in Europe. We feel lucky to have found this hotel and will stay there again on our next trip to Madrid, whether for business or pleasure.

<Content>8 Nights in the Attic Suite We just returned from an eight night stay in the Attic suite (the official name is the Palomar Suite, or Room 600). This room is unique to the hotel and definitely the largest room at the Plaza Mayor. We reserved it based solely upon the positive reviews on this site (and thanks to the Australian couple who corresponded with us a few months ago to follow up on their review). All in all, we were not disappointed.HOTEL LOCATION: The front of the hotel is located on one corner of the Plaza Mayor, which is indeed one of the best locations for tourism in the city. Between the front door and the P.M. is a pedestrian plaza with many shops (Plaza Santa Cruz). There are also drug stores and bodegas that sell pretty much anything you might need in the hotel (beer, wine, water, etc.) within a minute's walk. Additionally, the Sol, Opera, and Tirso de Molina Metro stops are all short walks from the hotel (Sol being the closest, about 6-7 minutes, and linking to many lines). Like most all of Madrid, this location is extremely safe and welcoming.THE ROOM: Ok. Not to brag, but we stayed in the Suite, so we can't comment on the other rooms in the hotel (whcih comprise the significant majority of the accommodations). But I will share our experience with you in case you want to try to snag this room yourself.Firstly, in case you're wondering, we only paid 110 EU per night for this room, whcih, in connection with its size, was a fantastic bargain.The Suite is an approx. 450 square foot L-shaped attic room, with slanted ceilings, exposed wood beams (lovely), and three skylight windows (which open). The room is accessable from a private stairway on the fifth floor, next to the elevator. The room has a central A/C and heater unit (the heater worked quite well for us, as it was around 3 C. most nights in Madrid). There is no bathtub, but the shower worked excellently and the bathroom was designed in a pretty modern style. A large cable television, small 'fridge, and a sitting area with two comfy chairs and a living room table made the place special. All in all, a big room.The room also has a large private balcony with wooden chaise lounge chairs and a table with a pretty nice view toward the Plaza Mayor (the mountains surrounding Madrid are also within view). And a nice place to hang your smoky clothes to air out at night (welcome to Spain!).Not only did we not hear any noise at night from other guests (the room is the only room at the top of the hotel) or traffic, the curtains on the numerous windows (and blinds on the skylight windows) would allow us to completely black-out the room to sleep late in the morning. Nice touch and convenient for the Madrid nightlife.HOTEL STAFF: Charming and helpful in all respects. The woman who worked the front desk during the day (I wish I got her name) was a total sweetheart. We kept commenting every day on how nice she was to us. She would greet us each morning with a huge smile and say BUENOS DIAS!, which, being Americans, freaked us out at first, but we eventually shed our inhibitions and learned to well in the sugary sweetness of this sincere hospitality. (And kudos to the young man who worked the midnight shift was also real nice). BREAKFAST: For 6 Euro, pretty good selection of coffee, juices, pastries, eggs, and meats. Charming restaurants are located all over the place, though, in case you want to venture out.WIFI: Located in the lobby and works great and is free.

<Content>Excellent Choice Began our 17 days in Madrid at the Plaza Mayor, Room #113........We had arrived at 9 am and were happily able to access our room by 10am which gave us an opportunity to take a quick nap before hitting the streets.....This was a perfect location and very inexpensive rates.....It was across the street from the Plaza Mayor and a short walk to Plaza del Sol....Lots of good restaurants in the area....Very nice room......decent size with French doors opening to a small balcony........Very comfortable bed and very clean.....Hotel staff was very helpful and internet access was readily available........small cafe in lobby but we chose to eat breakfast at a local bakery.....This was definitely a good choice for Madrid........

<Content>Great Hotel for the price ! Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend with friends in May 2005. The hotel is basic but for the price, excellent location and the friendly staff, I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone. The rooms were nice and clean 2 of the 3 rooms were large and on the road side (no real traffic noise problems) but the third overlooked the courtyard, which made the room a little dark, but whilst visiting Madrid you don鈥檛 spend too long in the rooms anyway. The best thing of all is the location, which is just outside the Plaza Mayor a great place for a beer, food, entertainment and people watching!

<Content>Good value for the money We liked the place overall, but I can't gush like some other reviews.Definitely one of the smaller hotel rooms we鈥檝e had, with barely enough room to walk around the bed (stepping over the suitcase on the floor in the process). Can鈥檛 say much about the furnishings since there were practically none.I would call the place clean, except for the minor ant invasion. How did they get up to the 5th floor?It was nice and quiet, despite being close to Plaza Major.Breakfast was a decent selection, including hot food, not just continental style.We were here in August with temps up to 110, so I can assure you that the AC is kept in good working order.Definitely let the staff recommend their favorite restaurants to you. Those were the best meals we had in Spain.This was no luxury hotel, but it was really cheap, so we felt like we got a good deal. I don't think it was particularly special, though.

<Content>Location, location, location...... A lot is said about location but this hotel had the best of any I stayed in Europe. Superbly positioned spitting distance from Plaza Mayor and roughly halfway between the East-West poles of Madrid's major tourist nodes (Prado and Palace Royal) - the location is truly outstanding. I had room tres, cero, uno (301) which was sensational value at 55 Euros (Double single use). The room itself was smallish but clean with a decent bathroom. It over-looked the Calle Atocha and the view wasn't half-bad - seemed to be opposite some swanky offices. Noise wasn't a problem. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful with good English. I didn't eat breakfast in the hotel so can't comment but there are a million places close-by for fuel replenishment. I had a great evening meal at nearby Los Galayos. If I were back in Madrid I wouldn't think twice about booking this hotel again. A tip for some - if you are doing any day trips out of Madrid the hotel staff will suggest Pulmantur Company. I did the Escorial/Valle de los Caidos half-day tour and the Toledo full day. The Toledo tour I thought was great taking you to some of the less frequented places with some great El-Greco. However, I was dissapointed with the Escorial tour as it is quite rushed and misses out on some of the major rooms. They also offer a full day tour of Avila/Segovia which looked interesting. With 3 day trips and at least 2 days of internal sight-seeing, Madrid can be worth up to a 5-day visit.

<Content>Great location. Basic and clean rooms. We stayed here for four nights and got value for money. The rooms were lovely and clean and the hotel麓s location was second to none. Word of advice though: bring earplugs. The cleaners start at 7 am and all the floors are wooden so you can hear them trundling up and down the corridors from 7. Otherwise, the staff were absolutely excellent and the breakfast for 鈧? was pretty good value for money.

<Content>Good hotel, super location Stayed here for five nights with my wife and two small children for the Cycling World Championships in September, 2005. Location can't be beat; we walked to everything--big 3 museums, Puerto Del Sol, Palacio Real, Plaza de Oriente (good playground for kids), terrific restaurants on and around Cava Baja, and of course the Plaza Mayor. Bus stop immediately in front of hotel, plus short walk to Sol or La Latina Metro stations gets you anywhere else. Hotel is clean and well-maintained. Our triple room room was small, but who cares when you are in Madrid--you are never in your room anyway! We ate breakfast at the hotel on two mornings. Good selection of breads, cereals, eggs, juices, coffee, and tea. The other mornings we hit the friendly cafeterias between the hotel and the Puerto Del Sol for churros. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. For example, they helped us buy tickets for an Atletico soccer game and they gladly made restaurant reservations for us. Will definitely return to Hotel Plaza Mayor and the always-wonderful city of Madrid.

<Content>Charming and affordable in the heart of old Madrid! The minute I walked into the small but stylish lobby of this renovated charmer, I was glad that I had followed the advice of fellow TripAdvisor readers and booked my Madrid stay here. Not a luxury hotel by any stretch of the imagination, the Hotel Plaza Mayor is a wonderful option for travelers looking for quiet, clean and comfy accomodations. I thought that the 7 euros for breakfast was a good value, with good strong coffee and a nice assortment of eats. In addition, the Hotel Plaza Mayor's location just a short walk to both the Plaza del Sol and Plaza Mayor seals the deal: This is the place for the intrepid traveler who values affordable style and comfort!

<Content>What a gem! You do not expect to find such great value for money or warmth of welcome in a Western European capital city hotel - how wrong! My friend and I stayed there for three nights during a very hot July - thank goodness for the air conditioning. At 65euros (拢40ish) a night this hotel cannot be faulted. It was very clean, the staff were exceptionally polite and helpful (even at 5am!) and the bathroom had a decent shower.The location is perfect: quiet yet central (2mins from Sol). I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone. (Thank you too, to Tripadvisor for helping us discover this place.) You will not be disappointed.

<Content>When staff can make a difference.... The Plaza Mayor Hotel is just like a dorm room in college. Same desk, same beds. That said, the entire place is cheerful in lively colors and it is as spotless as any place we have ever stayed. It is so cheap it is a steal and the location by the plaza is superb. It is clean, comfortable, well sited with a very good bathroom. While you may not get spectacular views, Frette sheets, fancy breakfasts (we didn't try it, we never do in hotels as a rule except in Italy) or Carlos V furniture, you do get a terrific deal along with the hotel's secret weapon: an unbelievably friendly, multilingual front desk staff that knows the area and the restaurants and night life. Did I mention they are friendly? Can't overemphasize this enough. Not lux, but delightful for the price.

<Content>Hit (mostly) or miss (somewhat)... My wife and I and extended family stayed at the PM for two nights this past June, and our experiences as far as the rooms go were quite different. Our room was top-notch and had a wonderful view of the city (it was our second anniversary so we splurged a bit), but my parents' room was barely big enough to fit the bed and had a lovely view of a wall. I would recommend asking for a superior double or whatever they call it if size is in any way important to you, and/or asking to see the room first. That said, the rooms/beds were all clean and comfortable, the bathrooms were a good size, and the location of the hotel is terrific--one block off the Plaza and a straight shot from the train station if you happen to be driving or taking a taxi (right up C/ Atocha.) The front desk staff was also very courteous and helpful. Ask for recommendations to dinner--they know the town well.All in all a good stay for us, the small rooms (in some cases) notwithstanding. Not sure if my parents would agree, however.

<Content>Fantastic find for location and price My sister and I thought this was a fantastic find for the location and price as I work for a non-profit and she a recent grad. A stone's throw from the Plaza Mayor, we walked practically everywhere from the hotel. We paid 70 euros a night for a double with bath, room 303. After much research on the internet I chose the Plaza Mayor and it was a snap to make the reservations on line. The room and bathroom were very clean (it seemed recently refurbished) and we enjoyed watching tv on our down time. This is a better than a basic hotel, and we stayed at those type of places on our trip with no heat and no bathroom. We would definitely stay here again if we were fortunate enough to return to Madrid.

<Content>great little bar I stayed several nights in the Plaza Mayor and quite enjoyed it. The rooms are a bit small, but certainly adequate. The staff is very good - they obviously enjoy what they do.The location, of course, can't be beat - lots of good and cheap food in the neighborhood. The little bar at the entrance is great - it's the sort of place you can stake your claim to a table and sit with your book for hours and is obviously popular with the vecinos. Noise is a bit of a problem at times, but that's something one has to get used to in Spain.

<Content>Great Stay! We had a wonderful stay at plaza mayor! We were in room 203, and yes the shape of the room is different, but we didn't care. The staff was soo friendly and helpful!! They always gave great suggestions for where to go eat and even go dancing! Just remember, this is a small hotel, I don't think they have more than 20 or so rooms, so there are certian things different from the large hotel. For example, there is no blow drier in the room, but they do have a few at the front desk, which can be borrowed and returned when finished with it. But that didn't bother us and we stay again. Plaza Mayor, is a hop skip and jump away, the Palacio and Catedral Almuneda is about a whole 5 to 10 minute walk away...everything is pretty close by and central. We would definitely stay here on our next trip!!

<Content>Nice little hotel I stayed at the Plaza Mayor for one night in April after beachfront accomodations in Marbella. It is very convenient for those arriving into madrid from the Atocha train station. The hotel is about ten minutes away by taxi. The Sol metro stop is a block away and was an easy ride to the airport, even with luggage.It is definitely convenient to the party and restaurant district nearby. We arrived around 6 pm so we didn't stray to far to see the other attractions such as the Palace which is not very far. The hotel staff was extremely friendly. Our room was definitely postage stamp size. i was told that we would have a double bed, but that was a stretch, more like a small version of an American full size bed. But as a seasoned european traveler, this posed no problem, just tight sleeping (and living) quarters for two people. After going to bed at 300AM, we definitely could hear other guests as they went to their rooms. At one point, we could feel the movements of the guests in the room next door as they prepared for bed. Thank God, they decided not to partake of one another because it would have definitely have been an up close and personal experience. :-)For a short stay at a no frills, clean and friendly in-town hotel, go for it. If you will be visiting for several nights, and space and insulation from sounds, is more up your alley, then this may not be your place. We woke up to a quartet of Spanish young ladies ending their partying at 6:30AM. You gotta love Spain, I sure did! At 65 euros, I would definitely stay at the Plaza Mayor again. Ciao!

<Content>Good Location  I recently stayed for three nights at the Hotel Plaza Mayor based on previous reviews. My evaluation is not quite as enthusiastic as most have been. True, the location is extremely convienient, the hotel is clean and the price is very reasonable. However, on the downside, I found the room to be as Spartanly-furnished as any hotel room, even a budget one, as I've ever seen. But most troublesome was the noise factor. The hallways and rooms are not carpeted, the walls are very thin, and the keys and locks are very noisy and must be used to both open and relock the door. Therefore, whenever anyone arrives and departs on your floor you are likely to be awakened. Given the party nature of Madrid, this was every night for me, often at 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. As mentioned in previous reviews, the buffet breakfast is very much to be skipped. Staff were friendly. Not a terrible choice, but I'd probably look elsewhere for my next stay in Madrid.

<Content>Great location, couple items to be aware of We stayed at the Hotel Plaza Mayor April 13-16, 2005, and it truly is a good bargain within walking distance of many of Madrid's major sites. However, as with most things in life, you get what you pay for. When we checked in, it was apparent that the bed linens had not been cleaned as there was something that looked suspiciously like dried blood on the sheets. I had to take them out to the cleaning staff and ask for replacements. Second, the heating unit in our room did not work until our 3rd night, which made for 2 cold nights (the weather in Madrid dropped to 8 degrees Celsius at night), despite asking the staff for help. Third, the room sizes are good only by European standards (or for any place where space is at a premium, like New York) - they are not spacious by any means, and they are downright tiny by comparison with most hotels throughout America. I am a Medium person in the U.S., but I literally had to squeeze into the shower. Overall, though, it probably is a great place if you don't plan to spend much time in your hotel room or if the weather outside is comfortable.

<Content>Friendliest hotel staff in Spain! We spent two nights in this excellent hotel. The location can't be beat for proximity to the lively Plaza Mayor, the rooms are clean and excellent for the price. Not fancy schmancy, just nice. Most people don't spend their time in Madrid in the hotel room anyway. So much to see and this location is within easy walking distance to the Royal Palace, Prado, the Caves, shops, cafes and restaurants galore.We found the front desk staff to be the most hospitable in Spain during our three weeks of travel! Extremely friendly - bright and cheery in the morning, afternoon and night. I don't know where they found the people at the front desk or the rest of the hotel staff we saw but these were by far the most welcoming people in the hospitality industry that we experienced in our 3 weeks of traveling throughout Spain. It is so nice to be greeted by a friendly desk clerk when you are checking into a hotel after traveling (or shopping!) all day. Our son spent most of one day in bed with a sore throat and cough- the front desk expressed concern about him and commented to him that they were glad he was feeling better when he was ready to get up and go again. Unrequested by us, housekeeping went up late in the afternoon to make up our room since they hadn't been able to get in to it while he was sleeping. Just a nice little thing but it's the little things that matter to you when you are traveling and away from home.  Hotel Plaza Mayor and its accomodating staff are rare find anywhere and certainly standout in the big, bustling city of Madrid.

<Content>Hotel  Stayed for one night in a superior room, #403, at a cost of 鈧?0 +tax. The room looked out onto Plaza Cruz, it had 2 sets of french doors and it was pleasant to watch the activity in the plaza below. When the windows were shut we had no problem with noise. The room was very clean, wooden floors and furnished in a modern Spanish style. The bathroom was small, but adequate, plenty of hot water and good power from the shower over the bath. Slept too late for breakfast, 7:00 to 10:30, so we ate at one of the many cafes in the area. The location is excellent and I consider we had very good value, as it is in the centre of the Spanish capital. Wherever you eat do not eat in the Restaurante Chino on the opposite side of the Plaza. Food and service were dreadful.

This wasn't helped by the scafolding outside the window and the contruction noise. Make sure to find out if the construction is completed. If you can get a great rate, then this is an ok choice. However if its expensive I would go elsewhere.

<Content>best hotel location in madrid We stayed at the hotel Plaza Mayor over the easter weekend. I decided to book it after reading the reviews here and I couldn't have been happier with the hotel. We stayed in a triple room which was a little cramped but we did have a lot of luggage with us. The room was very clean although nothing fancy. The only complaint I had was that the sheets on the beds were not big enough and after a night sleep we all woke up to find ourselves sleeping on the mattress but after mentioning our problem to the front desk the problem was fixed by using double bed sheets. The hotel staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel cannot be beaten. We walked everywhere and found it so nice to be able to just walk to the plaza mayor in the evening for an hour or so. For 80 euros a night you will not find better in Madrid.

<Content>great place Date: March 7, 8  10We had a lovely time at the Hotel Plaza Mayor. We stayed in room 503, a wonderful room at the front of the building on the 5th floor. A big room (for Madrid standards) with two big windows that opened and we could look out on the little square (Plaza Santa Cruz, I think it was?) to see everything going on. While there was no airconditioning, the room cooled off very nicely with just opening the windows.This hotel is not on Plaza Mayor actually but 1 block away, which meant that things quieted down quite nicely after 11 p.m., and also being up high meant we had less street noise. It is a small intimate hotel, and we really liked that.The staff could not have been more helpful with directions, suggestions for dinner, and help with the luggage. We actually left some luggage at the hotel when we went to Toledo one day. We stayed overnight in Toledo. When we came back to the hotel, they had us in the same room that we liked and our luggage all ready.The only reason I did not give this a 5 spot ranking is that we would have liked to have a drink when we got back after sightseeing, and relax a bit. But their little bar was closed, and the foyer of the hotel was underconstruction. The breakfast room was pleasant, and the breakfast while adequate was too expensive for what we got. We learned to have breakfast at a little cafeteria just around the corner. The carpet of our room was never vacuumed which I though odd and mentioned it at the front desk. They said they had plans to replace it. But everything was great apart from that. We felt very safe there day and night. This was helped by the fact that there was a big police presence in the square at all hours. We found out when we watched TV that an International Conference on Terrorism was being held in Madrid and one of the venues was a conference building about 300 ft. away on our little square! Political leaders from all over the world were attending! Then we understood why there were so many police directing traffic, standing around, and moving cars on the little square!We took the metro at Puerta del Sol and went everywhere. It was so easy to use. We loved the Prado - spent all day there and didn't see it all. We could have spent a second day at the Prado, but went to the Reina Sofia which was also wonderful.

<Content>Top Notch I stayed at Plaza Mayor for four nights with my girlfriend and we had a wonderful time. The hotel could not be any more perfectly placed for touring the city. It is a very short walk from the Sol Metro station (which is the heart of Madrid's metro system) and even closer to Plaza Mayor and the Old City. The rooms are clean and spacious, the hotel is clean and modern, and the staff is very accomodating. I needed to get the train schedule for the RENFE to Barcelona but the customer service people at RENFE spoke very fast (my spainish is only so-so) and I couldn't understand them. One of the fellows at the front desk called them for me and got the schedule. The area is safe and well lit. As with any city on the planet: the only unsafe streets are the streets you're on by yourself. When I go back to Madrid, I'll be staying at Hotel Plaza Mayor again. This hotel easily competes with the 4-star folks that offer laundry service and health clubs.

<Content>Great in many ways I stayed in Hotel Plaza Mayor twice in February 2005 (for one night each time) and was absolutely satisfied. The location is perfect, just round the corner from the omonimous square, and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The only trouble I had was to do with the TV: First time round there was no remote control, which I had ti retrieve from reception. The second time, there was a remote, but it was the wrong one, and when I finally was given the correct one, I still couldn't change the channel as the TV set was in some mysterious security mode. But anyway, you're in Madrid and don't want to waste your time watching the telly!

<Content>No public transport required.... Stayed at this hotel with a group of friends in February 2005. The first thing you notice about this hotel is the superb location (just off the Plaza Mayor which is one of the main squares in Madrid) - we didn't use any public transport all weekend as everything was in easy walking distance. The next and possibly most important feature is the cleanliness of this hotel - it easily rivals standards set by much more expensive hotels. To top it all, the staff were all very helpful and friendly - even when we were slightly drunk!!! Madrid is a fantastic city but this hotel definitely made the weekend extra special. I have since recommended it to friends who are visiting Madrid this year and have no doubts that I will stay here again. A top class hotel with very reasonable rates.

Staff are very friendly, even when you come back in the middle of the night !Didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, but there's so many other places nearby, it's not really necessary.Only minor gripe would be that it can be a little noisy, as people are coming in and going out at all hours, but otherwise, a great value, highly recommended hotel.

<Content>Great little budget hotel We stayed in this hotel in February 2005, after reading about it on this website. The room, although quite small, was clean and comfortable. It is central - within an easy walk of bars, restaurants, etc. and very reasonably priced. Not only that but also nice and quiet. The staff there were very friendly - couldn't recommend it more!

<Content>Excellent Hotel! This hotel is a great bargain. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They also speak English. The room was quite small, even by European standards, but it was impeccably clean. The maid was very nice to clean our room in the afternoon while we were out. You might want to pay the extra 10 Euro or so and upgrade to the superior/deluxe room, which is a little larger. Also, this hotel's location is excellent. I highly recommend it.!

<Content>Great Hotel I have stayed in this hotel twice now (May  Nov 2004), and on both times the staff and quality of the rooms has been fantastic. This has to be one of the best value for money hotels in Madrid.

<Content>Location, location, location This is a little gem. We stayed there for 3 nights Dec. 2004 in the attic room which is quite spacious - queen bed, sitting area, and balcony area with chairs, all for 100 Euros. Has its own bathroom of course. Ajustable heat/AC. The ceiling slopes downward so you have to be careful getting in and out of bed on one side if you're a bit tall. Has a safe in the room. Very clean and charming. Can walk everywhere - Prado and all.
