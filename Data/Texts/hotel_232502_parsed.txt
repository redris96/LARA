<Content>NEW YEAR's @ Swissotel Hello,I stayed at the hotel for 7 nights total. I had a Suite overlooking Dam Sq. My friends had a classic room. I recommend to pay the extra money and get a suite. It was 3 times the size of the classic room. You had a living room area, very large bathroom, and so much more. It was well worth it. I travel every month and this hotel room was one of my favorites. This trip however was for leisure.Upside: I had huge windows overlooking Dam Sq. I could see everything going on outside. Great view. Center of everything.Downside: My room overlooked Dam Sqaure so it was very noisy. Once the tram starts in the AM you hear it all the time. And the people were noisy. On New Years Eve i heard all day sound checks, etc for the live music later on in the night. Good thing was though, that i had my restroom to use instead of paying in some restaurant.Food in hotel restaurant was suprisingly good and not overpriced. I would have eaten more in the hotel restaurant if i had more time.

<Content>Very good When we arrived i didnt realise the hotel was so close to Dam Square, it was right on the corner and i was expecting lots of noise and no sleep. Our room was around the side of the hotel and we didnt hear hardly anything except the odd guest but nothing from outside which was surprising because of how busy the main road is.The hotel was very clean, the hotel reception staff and people who clean the rooms were very helpful and very polite, all could speak very good english which was very helpful.I would definately stay here again and recommend it to others, overall its the best hotel i have stayed at for a long time, the staff are very helpful, which is hard to find at some hotels.Very good : )

<Content>Great Location This hotel is in an excellent location right in the centre of Amsterdam. The hotel is lovely and clean and the receptionist and concierge are very helpful. We stayed in a classic room, the room was very comfortable, the bed was huge, the room also had a TV, mini bar, coffee machine and safe. The bathroomm was excellent with fresh towels every day, a heated towel rack, loads of nice bath and hair products and a hairdryer. The room was really warm, so much that we had to use the air conditioning. We did not have breakfast, however there are plenty of places to eat nearby. I would recommed this clean and comfortable hotel to everybody.

<Content>Central location within walking distance of train station Clean hotel in the heart of Amsterdam a ten-minute walk from the train station. The business center offers free Internet and printing. You have to use the key card to use most of the facilities, including the elevator. There are a number of restaurants on the same block as the hotel 鈥?and many are open late. Denver Mullican, New Orleans

<Content>nice hotel good location for wkend trip I found this hotel was ok. The location is excellent for a trip to Amsterdam only a short walk to everywhere you need to go. I think it was rated as a 4 star but i would have thought it's more like a 3 star hotel. The breakfast is very expensive 20 per person. The rooms are a decent size and were clean and comfy. The decor was just a bit outdated. Apparently hotels in amsterdam are quite expensive so I'd say this would be a standard 4 star over there.Dam square is lively and there is lots going on there during the day. You would be right next to shopping areas, canal tours, madamme tussauds, close to red light district and anne frank house. Van gogh museum is about 20 mins walk away. Also big tip for anyone don't get a taxi from the airport. It cost us 50 euro and was only about 15 mins in a taxi. I don't think they are regulated so they charge what they like. There is a train from central station that will take you straight to the airport for a few euro. Its a few hundred yards from the hotel.

<Content>Solid, okay Smart and high standard (for Amsterdam) where good hotels are at a premium in the centre.Please note, that luscious building portrayed on the Swissotel website is Dam Palace, not the Swissotel :-) The actual property is a rather narrow but pleasing facade given a bit of extra presence by some big Swiss flags.The standard room was nice, smart, but really rather tight. Saying that it was laid out very intelligently and everything had its own little space. My room had a Nespresso machine which was not functioning. Rather smokey smell despite being a n-s room.Business facilities were good and quick internet connection. The concierge was a very helpful guy. He was needed because there was a lack of communication between the Swissotel website and the hotel's reservations. But he sorted it out nicely.The bar is rather dead and throws you out on the dot of midnight, which is a shame but good for business.Not cheap by any means but it's fine and if you're in this part of town I think it's the best option available.

<Content>Agree, this is great hotel! After some dissapointment with our previous stay in London, and especially in Paris, we really find this swissotel Amsterdam a big relief; a Sort of happy ending of our long travel. It costs me cheaper than a small hotel in Paris. It has clean, very spacious room, relatively new, and nice modern design, with full facilities, mini bar, tea and coffer maker, sofa, business desk, internet connection, etc. etc. Right in the heart of amsterdam, with view from my room directly to dam square. Hotel staffs are very nice, the services meets professional expectations.I will recommend to everyone who wish to stay in great hotel in the heart of amsterdam city!The only note from me is the street noise, they could have made it better sound-proof. But, with dam square view and ambience, it pays off to me, but probably not for everybody.

<Content>3rd Time in this hotel and will always return! We have stayed here 3 times now. The first time was at Xmas 2006 where we were upgraded for free to a superior room. It was truly quite a big room and a huge comfy bed. We then returned in August 2007 for a week, again a great stay. A slightly smaller room this time, but didn't bother us because the bed was huge like the last time. We booked a superior room this time and paid for it because having the free upgrade the first time, we didn't want to be dissappointed. Although I'm sure the Classic Room is just as great.We returned in June 2008 for a long weekend. Because my partner smokes, they only had a few smoking rooms left due to the Smoking Ban that came in July 2008. They had redecorated 99% of the hotel rooms and cleaned them from smoke so they only had 2 available. We tried the Junior Suite, but found this too noisy because it overlooks Dam Square. It was a great big room, but no good because the trams were so loud. I would request a room either at the side of the hotel or in the inside of the hotel, you get a lovely peaceful sleep then. Never again would I have a room that overlooks the Square. It also had huge big windows with no Blackout curtains, this kept me awake too!We moved the next day to a different non smoking room, which was great. The Hotel Staff brought us up to look at rooms so we had the choice of the room we wanted.There is also a fire exit on each floor that allows you to smoke without having to leave the hotel, this was handy for my partner. So request a room near the fire exit if you want a smoke. Also, I was told theres 2/3 hotel rooms with balconys that you can smoke on. You will need to request these rooms, but they are on the front of the hotel, overlooking Dam Square.The Dam Plaza is part of the hotel but fairly expensive, the food is outstanding. I'm so fussy but there was not one thing I could fault with that food. Burgers, Chicken, Steak, Fish - all gorgeous. The Room Service is spot-on too. The Dam Burger is very srcummy!The bathroom is very nice, modern and clean. You can listen to the TV in the bathroom as it has speakers. Great Bath and shower. Sheets are changed every 2 days. Fresh towels when you want etc.The Dam Plaza also have a small Bar now, which was only put in this year, 2008!Because we are planning to go back this Xmas, the receptionist has given me her email address so we can book a room through her, she is going to save us a really nice quiet room with Blackout Curtains. I love my sleep.I wouldn't dare try any other hotel in Amsterdam. It's not cheap there to stay, but I'm sure you will have a great stay.

<Content>Great Hotel!!!!! Just come back from a weekend in Amsterdam, I searched lots of website for hotels and this hotel was the best for its location and price. I booked direct with them for 166 euros per night. (Don鈥檛 forget the 5% tax on top.)Me and the group of friends arrived on Friday afternoon but there was a mix up with the rooms. They couldn't have been more helpful, I booked 3 rooms originally but they only had 1 room left. So they booked my friends into another hotel for one night. They paid for the taxi's to get there and back in the morning, plus they upgraded us all for the rest of our stay.The rooms we stayed in were Business rooms which were ok, what you expect in any city business hotel. They are clean and have all you need for a weekend city break.The hotel is located on Dam sq and everything is minutes away !!! All in all, the hotel is clean, all the fancy toiletries in the bathroom, robes etc.The hotel staffs are very friendly and were always helpful to us.A very nice city hotel!!!I would stay there again.

<Content>Mind the noise! So, we arrived in Amsterdam via the train from the airport. Took us about 10-15 minutes Walking from the station to the hotel, But we didn鈥檛 mind because it was an exciting walk. The front desk staff was friendly and recommended a few spots around town. The actual room was definitely small (But small is what you get in Europe). We were facing an alley on the side of the hotel. It got very noisy in the alley at night with people walking through the alley early in the morning, etc. Also, there was a street sweeper that went through the alley very early in the morning, so it was very hard to get a decent sleep each night. Also, the air flow in the room was non-existent so it got hot in the room. We are used to sleeping with a fan in our room back home, so it was either extremely quiet with the window closed, or very noisy with it open. Other than that though, the hotel was fine. If you don鈥檛 like a lot of late night noise I wouldn鈥檛 recommend staying in or around Dam Square. It鈥檚 literally ALWAYS busy with large crowds at all hours. Some recommendations for food: There is a pancake house a few blocks away in Jordan called 鈥淪ara鈥檚 Pancake House鈥? Awesome Waffles. We ate there twice.For Mexican, good drinks: Rose鈥檚 Cantina. Amazing dinner experience.We also found a Indonesian restaurant with a beautiful outside terrace on the same street as Rose鈥檚 Cantina. Highly recommended. Would stay at Swissotel again, but only if it was located in a quieter part of town!

<Content>Best staff ever - Hotel is ok - Great Bar thanks to the great staff of the swissotel, they made our stay something special. I never found hotel staff that is so well trained, so friendly and just perfect - thanks guys.the hotel itself is a solid 4-star experience located direct in the middle of amsterdam (so sometimes a bit noisy).there is no parking space, but you can part opposite of it at the mall.there is also a restaurant (DAM PLAZA) in the hotel serving excellent beer and steak - try also the tuna sashimi.If you have to go to Amsterdam -- take the Swissotel !!!

I found the room big even to Australian standards. The service was excellent, the staff very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Good hotel but needs some improvements Positives: Unbeatable location, good-sized room with plenty of storage and all the amenities you could want. The bed is large and comfortable. Bathroom with separate bath and shower, good water pressure, nice toiletries. The reception staff are friendly and helpful. Free internet access + printing in the business centre.Negatives: Old windows which let a lot of noise in. Not recommended if you're a light sleeper. Breakfast is expensive (20 euros), there are better alternatives nearby. I was disappointed by the randomness of the maid service. My room had turn-down service included but I didn't get it every evening. The staff also ignored do not disturb signs. I've stayed in other Swissotels and I've never experienced such poor service before.Summary: a good hotel, I will stay here again. Hopefully they'll have ugraded the windows and re-trained the housekeeping staff by then!

<Content>Location, Location, Location We stayed at the Swissotel for 4 nights in May. It is in an ideal location to enjoy the city. We debated between saying at the Marriott or the Pulitzer, and chose the Swissotel mainly because of its location right on Dam Square. We had a business room, and initially they tried to put us in a room with a little step out balcony on Dam Square. We complained about the noise, and were given a nicer room in the back of the hotel. Our view was of McDonald鈥檚 and Burger King. Both closed at 11:00 PM and the room was nice and quiet, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We ate the hotel breakfast 3 of the 4 mornings, it was fine although not cheap. The bottom line for us was to be able to walk to lots of great restaurants, the train station, and all the other local sights. The room was nice, and the hotel staff accommodating. There was a flower in the room, a welcoming bottle of wine, and other surprise nice little touches. The hotel also saved a lot of money compared to the Marriott and Pulitzer. Highly Recommended.

<Content>Great hotel, fantastic location We stayed in this hotel from 22nd - 24th June and to be honest i dont think we could have chosen a better place. Not just because of the rooms but also because of the location. To be honest when you are away you only spend a few hours in teh hotel and to sleep there. The hotel is located right next to dam square on the main road (DAMRAK) to the centraal station. It is about a 10 minute walk (with luggage) from the station.To get to the station from teh airport is 7.60 euos (from a machine) or 8.60 from the counter and takes about 15/20 mins. So from the airport you can be in your hotel room in about 30 mins with no hassles at all.The hotel itself was clean and new and had everything that you would want from a stay there. We had a king sized bed, TV with uk channels and satelite channels, coffee machine and a nice bathroom. Our bedroom was on the side of the hotel (not facing the main road) however there was good double glazed windows and we didnt get any noise at all. If you had a road facing room you may get noise but couldnt say for sure.We didnt get breakfast included and for 20 euros there are cheaper places around.All in all a great place to stay and the location couldnt be better.

<Content>Great Location, Good Hotel Location is absolutely fantastic. Bang on Dam Square. Cannot get more central. I got a good deal from the hotel website for 125 euros. Which for this hotel in this location is amazing. Everything else was above 200. I booked a standard room and when I got in paid 40 euros extra to upgrade to a superior room. A tip: on the website the superior room was 225 but I paid 40 extra so got it for only 165. So if you want to upgrade do it at the counter. 2nd tip: the superior is not that much superior to the standard room so dont waste the extra money. Room was large size for european standards. For some reason there was not enough lighting in the room. Here is the strange thing. This was a superior room and the TV was a 14 inch small one. I wonder why they have not upgraded the TVs. The best part about the hotel is the location. It is on the main Dam square. There are bars, cafes and restaurants all around. You can walk to the hotel from the central station. Another place in Amsterdam to go for good bars and restaurants is Leidseplien. It about 5 tram stops away and tram costs 1.60 per trip. This is a great hotel to stay at the price. Check on the website. They always have good deals.

<Content>Spot on! If you have read any of my other reviews you will know I can be merciless about my opinions on bad hotels.This place gets top marks.It is a straight forward 3 star hotel in a central location. The staff are professional to a fault. Food good. Meeting room fine. Bedroom nice.Is it a 5 star world class, hot property? No - but I give it top marks because it is exactly what it says on the tin.I have already booked myself back in for next week - there was no point in trying anything else.I have stayed at the Ibis by Central Station - fine for a budget stay and good location - but no meeting room which I needed. Sofitel Amsterdam is great but over budget for this trip. Krasnapolski is lovely (opposite Swissotel)- but again too dear for this trip but I am staying there in October again as I like it.Well done Swissotel you get my vote!

<Content>Great Location, Awesome Staff As mentioned in other reviews you could not ask for a better location in Amsterdam than the Swissotel. It is close to everything from shopping to attractions and restaurants. The best thing about this hotel is their terrific staff. The staff is extremely knowable, courteous and helpful. They cater to their guests. There is nothing that they wont do to make your stay enjoyable. I emailed the hotel 2 days prior to my arrival and they were able to check me into my room by 11AM. The rooms look exactly as they appear on the website. They are extremely clean with nice furnishings. The window does open and when closed they are soundproof. I was in a premium room. The one flaw of the hotel is that the classic and premium rooms are very small. As noted on the website they are no more than 200 sq ft. However, they are nicely furnished and the small space is utilized very well. Housekeeping is excellent. The wireless internet connection was not working and you should bring your own ethernet cord for the wired connection which is 15 euros/24 hours. It worked great. The bathroom was small but very clean with the usual bath ammenities. Note that the bar of soap given is the size of a half dollar so you should pack your own. The water pressure was excellent with plenty of hot water. I used the well equipted gym facilities everyday and the business center offers free internet and printing for guests. There is a large supermarket 3 blocks away. I would definately stay here again for all the reasons mentioned. This is a very good 4 star hotel. The pictures on the Swissotel website are extremely accurate.

Room service was mediocre. The phones in my room also didn't work, but to be fair this was likely an isolated incident. Hotel staff were helpful and courteous. Overall a disappointing experience.

<Content>Great quick trip We stayed at the Swissotel 2 nights, Mar 8-10. It was in a great location and we walked from the train station to the hotel for check in. The rooms were very well appointed and the service was good as well. It is a little pricey, but then again I noticed that most hotels were with similar amenities. Unfortunately for us the weather was terrible. It rained and was very windy! We we walked in the bad weather and got soaked, but I can see where this would be a fabulous city in the spring/summer! Despite all this we had a fabulous time and Swissotel was very accommodating and we certainly would stay there again!

My husband and I were on our honeymoon and travelled from Paris ( 5 night stay ) to Amsterdam ( 5 night stay ). In Paris my husband was really ill with bronchitis and I fell ill in Amsterdam - while at the Swissotel. Staff facilitated a doctor call out and we had an upgrade too. Nothing was too much!I would definitely stay at the swissotel again - although a little pricey of room only. It was well worth all our pennies we paid for it especially if you need to spend time in a hotel room. Suffice to say, our room bound stay in the novatel Paris was no match!Thanks again.

<Content>Great Hotel The Swissotel was excellent. All staff were polite and respectful, the room was good and breakfast was lovely - lots of choice. The location was central to everything. If I HAD to be negative, it would be that the housekeeping team were a little enthusiastic! When we put the 'Do not disturb' sign on the door they knocked to see whether we wanted our room cleaned! THEN, later in the day they telephoned the room to ask again! This happened twice.

<Content>Recommended... Overview: We loved the hotel, the room was comfortable and the location was very good. Pros; 1) Location was great. Just a five minute walk from the central station, tram stop just outside the front door. Easy to walk to all the major central amsterdam sites. 2) Its clean and comfortable. Cons: 1) No slippers and just one scratchy bathrobe in the room. 2) Crazy expensive for internet (it was 17 euros day?). Summary: Lots to do and see nearby. If you want to visit a coffeeshop I highly recommend Abraxis. It is like 1-2 blocks from the hotel. We did not try the restaurant - there were too many choices nearby.

<Content>Another nice stay at the swissotel Stayed a night at the middle of January, booked through website, and confirmed by phone to the hotel, to ensure I get the room I wanted (one of those that have a small balcony overlooking the dam square ). The room was decent sized, modern and very comfortable and, although on the 1st floor, I barely noticed the noise from the busy street. Hotel desk and concierge service was also extremley friendly and professional. Only downside was that the small balcony was partly blocked, so could not step out. Overall, a great hotel in an excellent location, and, as usual, great VFM. Highly recommended.

Hotel staff from receptional desk to restaurant staff were all friendly and very helpful. Rooms were clean with excellent bathroom with separate shower cubicle. Lovely to receive complimentary wine, toblerone and water in room on arrival. Breakfast was also very good with everything you could really want. Room was located on top floor - was extremely warm even with window open. Not sure air-con was really working correctly in room. Very central location but no noise at night to disturb your sleep. Would definately stay here again and recommend this hotel when in amsterdam.

<Content>Great location This trip was a suprise 30th Birthday treat.The hotel is really central to everywhere. The room we were allocated was great, it was on the first floor, The bed was huge and extremely comfy and our room was very quiet.The staff were friendly and helpful.We went for breakfast one morning that wasn't included in the price and it was fairly pricey at 20 Euro's each. There are loads of Places to eat close by for a lot cheaper.Will stay here again on my next visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>Great location. My wife and I stayed at the Swissotel for a brief 2 night stay in Amsterdam (Sept. '07). I booked our room very last minute after deciding to switch hotels 2 days prior to our arrival most likely resulting in a rather high room rate. Amsterdam is a very expensive city when it comes to lodging however the Swissotel is worth it if you get a fairly reasonable rate. The location is perfect! It is a very easy walk from the train station to the hotel. It is right next to Dam square and a very close walk to the red light district. All of Amsterdam's tourist attractions are very close and we walked everywhere. The staff were friendly and spoke very good english. The rooms were a bit small (normal for european standards) but were clean. The Swissotel offers a nice place to relax after experiencing all of what Amsterdam has to offer. Bottom line:Location is great!Staff nice.Clean hotel.Decent but overpriced food.Quality bathroom.Safe provided.Internet access in hotel....In all I would return to Swissotel but would not pay $517 US dollars a night (my fault for changing at last minute). If you are looking for pure luxury then do not stay here but if you just want a nice place to stay while you enjoy Amsterdam then this should work well.

<Content>Terrific hotel in a very busy area Great hotel in a very busy area. We had three rooms which included a suite on the sixth and third floors and a superior room on the sixth floor. All rooms were extremely comfortable and clean. The bathrooms were terrific and the beds were large and comfortable. Go for the back rooms if you don't like noise but be prepared that they have no views. In fact, I would suggest that you request rooms on floors above three because being close to the street is difficult. The hotel staff was great. They were very friendly and accomodating. Our only issue was the surrounding street which was VERY busy. If we were to travel again to Amsterdam would probably choose a quieter location. That said, if this is a first visit, Swissotel may be just right.

<Content>Swissotel Standard King Size room The hotel is located at Dam Square and is easy to find as is it is on the main drag from the train station. Booked this hotel last minute due to the internet discount and as last time I visited Amsterdam I was impressed by the appearance. The staff are very friendly and helpful. In my opinion the hotel is a little expensive for the room setup as its what you would expect in a travel lodge style hotel. The room was well furnished with a very large bed which is pitched as king size, but its huge. The room and bathroom is very clean and cleaned daily. Other facilities include a small but well equiped cardio gym and a swissOffice which gives you free access to the internet in a dedicated room with cd rom/writers and card reader drives. Good for uploading holiday snaps while away, or just emailing friends to rub it in. The hotels restuarant was excellent. expect to pay around 60 Euros for 2 main meals and a bottle of house wine, but its worth it. If I go to amsterdam again I would stay here, so if your going, book this place.

<Content>Great location Looks are deceiving!From the outside it looks like a small thin Amsterdam building but behind and above at least 4 shop fronts the hotel becomes suprisingly big.Right opposite Dam Sq it is conveniently located and the tram stops outside taking you to the trainstation one way and Rembrandt Sq the other.The rooms are great and it is ultra modern inside with probably one of the best restaurants in the city centre on the ground floor.Would recommend it. I stayed at the Victoria Hotel the year previous and this one is the better of the two.

<Content>Think Twice about booking this hotel..... Our family just came back from a 4 night stay at the Swiss Hotel in Amsterdam. We were booked via a travel agent. We travel with our children and our confirmation requested non smoking rooms. Upon arrival we were booked into smoking rooms on the first floor, overlooking the very busy square and McDonalds. We told the management that the rooms were unacceptable and we were told that there was nothing else available. We told them we were going to get somthing to eat and to please try to help find a us some solution or book us into another hotel. When we arrived back from dinner they did find 2 rooms (non smoking), on the first floor, that we did check into. Soon after, we realized that the air conditioning did not properly work in our room. and was not fixed for the next 2 nights. The hotel location is good as long as you dont mind being in the middle of The Times Square of Amsterdam. Right ouside the door are: McDonalds, Burger King and KFC....The staff was very nice and made some excellent restaurant and tourist choices for us. Amsterdam is small enough that I would suggest staying a few blocks further away from Dam Square, and have a bid more piece and quiet.

<Content>Nice hotel, convenient location We stayed 3 nights at this hotel on our first visit to Amsterdam. It turned out to be an excellent choice. We requested a quiet room on an upper floor to avoid the noise on the busy street the hotel is located on. We got a room on the top floor on the back. Fair size for a Europeon hotel. Clean and well appointed. Turn down service. Nice bath although we are not fans of the shower screens. It is just hard to keep the floor from getting all wet. Plenty of counter space in the bath.Hotel is about a easy 10 minute walk straight down the street from the train station. No need for a taxi. Located right at Dam Square. Area is a bit like Times Square in NYC.Breakfast was not included. We found the hotel breakfast too pricey and opted for crousaints, fruit and juice at a market just a few doors down from the hotel.Staff was friendly and helpful. We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel: Few faults! We stayed in a Swiss Suite for 2 nights last week: The Room was excellent! The Bathroom is a joy! The bed MASSIVE!Front of House staff friendly and efficient!Two things to beware of though!:Don't purchase your breakfast from the hotel: Overpriced and every single addition, (including a cup of tea!) is charged for separately! Just walk a feww hundred metres and you'll find breakfast's of better quality at half the price!Don't smoke dope in your room: There's a 150 Euro fine! Don't even be tempted! (Those observant enough will see filters in the rooms which arelaced there to catch you out!).Chris (Hove: UK)

<Content>Good hotel in a great location I stayed at the Swissotel Amsterdam for six nights on a business trip. The location was fantastic - around the corner to Dam Square, and less than ten minutes on Damrak to the Central Station. Better yet, the tram stop was right outside the hotel, where frequent trams took me to all the major attractions within minutes. The RAI convention center in the suburbs was about twenty minutes away on the tram.There were dozens of shops and restaurants in easy walking distance.The hotel itself was fine. Staff were professional, knowledgable and courteous, room was a good size (for European hotels), spotlessly clean and with modern furnishings. A minor issue with the bathroom door not closing correctly was promptly fixed after I reported it.Internet connection worked well with my laptop but was pricey at 15 euros per day. Go for the wired connection - the hotel will lend you an ethernet cable if you need one. A colleague trired the wireless connection option and reported that the connection failed often.My only problem of note. The hotel lost one of my shirts from the laundry service. The hotel covered the replacement cost of the shirt as soon as I told them.Overall an enjoyable stay and a decent well run hotel in a great location for both tourists and business travellers. Would certainly return.

<Content>We found it ok too..... We spent two days there last week - myself, my wife, our teenage son and his friend.Rooms were clean and functional, beds were huge and comfortable. Charge for breakfast was extortianate so we ate elsewhere - there are lots of places nearby to eat at a fraction of the cost.Access past reception is secure - key card is required to call the elevator.Reception staff polite and helpful.Be aware that there is some very noisy (during the day but starting early in the morning) construction work going on in Dam Square (between Di Bjenkorf department store and the national monument. Didn't get round to asking what it was (pehaps one of the locals could advise?) and it didn't spoil our stay.

<Content>Cheated at checkout At check-in we were told we could pay with US Dollars, for our convenience, and there would be no fee. I guess they think most people won't know to check their rate to see that they add a large exchange rate. They could care less that they lied at check-in and wouldn't change to charge me in Euros. The hotel is located on a busy street and the taxi can't let you off in front and you have to cross a busy street and with your bags, there is no doorman to help. We did have a nice room with a good view of Burger King across the alley.Also they don't seem to replenish the breakfast buffet so you have to get down early. They would be better served charging more for their rooms and being honest with their guestsjuma10@email.com

The check-in whas quick with plenty of staff in the reception. I had the smallest room. The room whas nice, functional with a good bed - but perhaps a little crowded for 2 people. The bathroom was all tiles, and with good waterpressure, even beeing on the top floor.Excellent for business, or for staying over weekends.

<Content>Wow at Swissotel Amsterdam In April we stayed 8 days in the Swissotel on Damsquare. When we came in the room there was this nice fruit and letter by the Manager. Because we were longstayers (as they called it) we got a voucher to have a drink in the oldest cafe of the Netherlands (you should go there) and discount on internet in the room(and which is for free anyway in the business centre) Very nice gesture! The service in the hotel is really outstanding!! Room was very nice and we simply enjoyed our stay very much! One thing; do not smoke hash in the room cause they will fine you for it!

<Content>Overpriced Overpriced and noisy if you are facing the square. Location is good but surrounds are not attractive. Most staff were helpful. However, breakfast staff questioned us when we wanted a cup of water for our baby (we did not get breakfast included, even though I had ordered breakfast when I spoke to the reservations staff). We paid 鈧?60 a night. We usually spend this and get so much more for our money, even in London! Have low expectations and you will not leave disappointed.

<Content>Great hotel in Amsterdam Me and my wife have just come back from a three night weekend break in Amsterdam. We stayed at the Swissotel and we were so happy with the choice. We had booked a standard room and when we arrived 1230 the room was not ready, it was sorted by 1500 and although we did not haggle or kick up a fuss we were upgraded to a junior suite. The room was huge with a great bathroom, a bed that must have been 7' square and five windows overlooking Dam Square. The standard of the room, the quality of the overall hotal and most of all the service were absolutely excellent. If you are going to Amsterdam for a holiday and are looking for a great hotel in a central location I could not recommend it highly enough.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at this hotel as others we had looked at were full up. I was very impressed with the service - we received 2 free canal tour tickets (whether they were for my birthday or not we didnt ask), and the computer also sang happy birthday to me on the actual day.Room service is excellent with a good choice and the mini bar has a good selection at not bad prices for a hotel. We had a direct phone number to the room.Housekeeping was excellent and a very quick turnaround and everything was spotless. There was also a good fan/air conditioning unit in the room. We stayed in 119 which faces the side street, but there is no noise at night.Excellent location and breakfast buffet service with eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, croissants, cereal, meats, breads and juices as well as tea and coffee.

<Content>Great Location and Outstanding service We wanted a hotel with a Dam Square view. the NH Kranpolsky was booked...so we decided on the Swissotel. What a great choice!!! the Service was impecable, and the veiw was amazing. We could see the Obelisk and the trams passing by. The Beds were always turned down, and the room service was quick. The staff were friendly, welcoming and very helpful. From Centraal Station, the hotel is a 5 min walk, or a quick tram ride.If breakfast is not included in your rate, the price for the buffet is a bit steep..17euros a person. that was the ONLY drawback. Art the reservationist at the hotel will confirm and perfectly describe your room to you.

<Content>Location, location, location Location, location, location and service.A very good hotel located around corner of Dam Square in Amsterdam, NL. Hotel is excelent for bussness and family type travel. The service at the hotel is typical to all Swiss Hotel chain and is simply excelent. Room was very clean and well made. Maybe a little small, but very comfortable. Everything in room was working. The bed was two doubles one next to another creating large size bed. Very comfortable.The only minuses - avoid rooms 133, 233 and maybe 333. They are facing Burger King which is open 24/7 and attract very loud teenage crowd at night after 3am, when everything is geting closed. Also second floor of Burger King is at the same level with room 133 and you need to keep your shades closed all the time.

<Author>awful_swiss_hotel
<Content>Trouble in paradise Swiss Hotel was awful The Swiss Hotel is very centrally located and hence the price. My wife and I stayed for three nights. The superior room was very small and would be comparable to a good three star hotel.Whilst it was generally clean there were the odd things that would put you off.  - Food from someone's room service was lying in the corridor that must of fell off from the cleaning and was left all day.- The noise from the outside extraction fans for the buildings air conditioning was very loud. - My wife found a pubic hair in the freshly made bed. - I was expecting a queen sized bed (as advertised) and what we got was two single matresses pushed together with a big ridge down the middle of the bed. - The bathroom was so small that you very nearly bang your elbows moving around it. I also found the finishing around the bath was a little dirty/tatty.I made a complaint to the manager about the matress and the fact that I had paid for a superior room and was expecting a decent bed and they point blank refused to give me any discount. They apologised but it was still an awful hotel.Would not recommend this hotel, definately not worth the money, avoidlike the plague.

<Content>Nice Location, Don't Smoke Cannabis in Room I stayed in the Swissotel in January 2006 and smoked cannabis in the room with no problem. I again stayed for 10 days in January 2007. On the second day of my stay, the manager and a woman from the front desk banged on my door stating the smoke detector was stuck. They entered the room and discovered a joint. They said a 150 euros cleaning fee would be assessed and if any further infraction occurred that the police would be summoned. I later noticed a small sign on the front desk announcing their drug policy, but did not see it on check in. I would think a warning would have been more appropriate. By the time I checked out 8 days later, there was no smell whatsoever in the room, but the hotel refused to deduct the 150 euros cleaning fee. So be warned.

<Content>You wont find a better combination in Amsterdam - location, amenities and value I have been traveling to Amsterdam for many years and have stayed at what I thought were the best hotels (Krasnapolsky, Grand Demure, Amstel, Victoria, Jolly, Golden Tulip, l'Europe, etc.). This past week I decided to go celebrate my 33rd birthday with a group of 20 friends from Puerto Rico, the U.S. and London and wanted to try a different hotel. I was looking for a decent place, at least four starts and centrally located, but that it would not cost me 1200 euros per room for just three nights (the trip was on me and I knew we would rarely use the room). Thus, I booked rooms at the Swissotel through bookings.nl at a pretty good price (498 euros for a standard room for three nights and 689 euros for the suites). When more people wanted to come to the trip and the hotel appeared to be sold out using the online travel sites they contacted the hotel directly and they gave them the same rate I got. I must mention that the attention and service via email while doing the reservations directly with the hotel was outstanding (thanks Ms. Schutte). Even the concierge emailed me giving suggestions for restaurants and answered most of my follow up questions. It sounded too good to be true so I kept some cancellable reservations at five star hotel where I had stayed many times before across the square just in case that we did not like the hotel. However, upon arrival, the service was as expected, they had most rooms ready for early check-in. The hotel is perfectly located in Dam Square, five meters from the tram stop! and the best thing is that you cant hear any noise in the rooms despite the location!!! The rooms were comfortable and had all the amenities customary of a four star hotel (what we are accustomed in the U.S.). The service, its worth repeating, was impeccable.Everyone had an amazing time and the hotel was one of the highlights. To anyone traveling to Amsterdam; solo, couples or as a group I think you will be pleased with the Swissotel.

<Content>Lovely hotel I stayed at the hotel in February 2007. Overall i found the hotel to be excellent. Firstly the location of the hotel is ideal. It is next to Dam square and all the sights were in walking distance, I never used trams or taxis once. And i easily walked from Centraal station to the hotel and found it with minimal effort.Secondly the room (i stayed in a superior room) was very clean, tidy and massive. I'd ordered a double room but the bed had to be king size. The room was cleaned every day we were there and was spotless. The room i stayed in didn't have much of a view but that didn't bother me at all. There was no noise at all at night time from outside. The staff are very friendly and helpful, they supplied maps etc.Finally I never ate in the hotel so I can't comment on the food. I would return to this hotel if every returning to Amsterdam.

<Content>Nice and Central We spent a three night break in this hotel. Our main criteria was that we wanted to be central in Amsterdam. How much more central could we have been? About 40 paces from Dam Square. We walked up to the hotel from the central station (about ten minutes).The accommodation was modern, bright, airy and clean. Our room was big and well appointed with Satellite TV and coffee makings. Two double beds gave us plenty of sleeping space.The small reception was manned 24 hours and the staff were very helpful supplying maps and good tour advice - without being too pushy. There is a restaurant but we didn't use it as there as hundreds of places nearby to eat.We would definately use this hotel again and thouroughly recommend it for short breaks

<Content>Great place to stay Well situated hotel - particularly in respect of access to public transport. Modern spacious rooms, attractively decorated - light and bright. Noisy square, but good double glazing makes this no problem. Nicely appointed small bathroom. The real plus is the reception staff - they smile all the time and are genuinely eager to please and help. Restaurants in the immediate vicinity are nothing special- but staff will advise on better ones a little further afield which is no problem with the excellent transport system. Well recommended

<Content>Good location, average service/accommodation This hotel is in a great location, near the central station, although there is major construction outside as they build the new metro in Amsterdam.I stayed in a 'business advantage room'. The room was quite large and spotlessly clean however it looked quite dated and was very average in terms of presentation.I felt the breakfast was poor value and badly presented. When I arrived breakfast still had an hour to run, but there was only a limited selection of items remaining.

<Content>Great location by Dam Square This hotel is so easy to get to, it is about a 5 minute walk from the Central Station. The reception is airy and light and the staff are very welcoming. Security is good - you can only get to the upper floors via your room key pad to access the lift.We had a room on the back of the building, the view was only of a flat roof but it was so quiet. The bed was one of the largest and most comfortable I have ever slept in (believe me, I'm really funny about strange beds - I have been known to sleep on a sheet on the floor rather than risk the bed!!) and the bathroom was spacious with a very invigorating shower. Good range of toileteries as well. The room was spotless, modern and comfortable - just how I like them.There is a small gym for the use of residents which is more than adequate and which provides masses of towels and a water dispenser, we only once had one other person in thereA Nespresso machine in the room was great for my husband but hopeless for me as a tea drinker. I asked for a kettle and one was delivered to the room within 5 minutes, typical of the excellent 'can do' attitude of all the staff with whom we had dealings. There is a tram stop immediately outside the hotel, the No 4 tram took us straight to RAI, the exhibition centre, where we were based for 3 days. Get the tram ticket strip from reception before you board, good value at 6.70 Euros for 15 units - the RAI is 3 units each way. There is a wonderful department store opposite, couldn't cope with the name but it starts with Bj... a cross between John Lewis and Selfridges and had we not had a busy business diary I would have spent a serious amount of time in there!The location of the hotel is marvellous, very central and easy to get to anywhere, but you do need a good map when you are just wandering around and a good pair of shoes with thick soles would help as well, the cobbles are quite unforgiving on your feet. Also take great care when crossing the roads, the cyclists have all been brought up to believe that they are kings of the road and very few bikes seem to have brakes!We will definitely stay at the Swissotel again and I recommend it.

<Content>Geniune Service! We arrived very early and was informed that our room was not ready. I've notified them twice that we were going to have an early arrival but still not acknowledged. The receptionist was very sincere and tried his best to get us a room and while we waited, he reassured us over and over again he was trying his best to get someone to clean up our room. The waiting was worth it! We were upgraded (having a swissotel member account helped I think), the room was superb, spacious (not the typical small room you'd expect) and clean. I've been to a lot of places and stayed in a lot of hotels, this is the first hotel I consider the top of the class in service!The first time I read the reviews on Swissotel Amsterdam and people were talking about their great service, I thought that well, it should be a standard that we expect from all high class hotels, but its different here, we really felt their genuine efforts to please and try their best to make us welcomed and comfortable. We were not dissapointed.The location was also a plus, since it was smack in the middle of the old town, no matter where we go its still near to the hotel. One advice though, its better to get breakfast outside where there's plenty of cafes which serves breakfast far more cheaper.

<Content>Great Location!!! This is just a great hotel all around! To start the rooms are ultra-modern and very large, especially for European hotels. Very new and clean. The location is unbeatable. It is right in the middle of the Damsquare within walking distance of the Centraal Station. In the area there are numerous restaraunts and places to shop. Shopping can range from high end to simple souvenirs. You are also a couple blocks away from the red light district and many museums. The hotel has air conditioning and a free internet lounge. The staff is very helpful. You will not want to leave this hotel!!!

<Content>Great place to stay in Amsterdam We go to Amsterdam a couple of times a year and have stayed in different hotels almost every time. The Swissotel is probably the best one we have stayed in. The location is unbeatable being right in Dam Square. The hotel is nicely trendy without being austere and the rooms are a nice size. The showers are incredibly powerful and vey invigorating the morning after a heavy night out! The buffet breakfast was also very good and was good value as it was included in our rate. On the whole, I would highly recommend it and will be returning here at some point.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Amsterdam, Netherlands - SwissotelDate: August 2006Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member from New JerseyGreat location right in the heart of the city, and very close to the main train station. Only thing was that they did not have a breakfast included. I prefer hotels that offer a breakfast, this cuts down on time spent searching for food during my vacation. The rooms were very clean and tastefully decorated. Very comfortable bed. Well ventilated non-smoking room. Staff spoke perfect english, and they were very nice and helpful.

<Content>What a great hotel! The Swissotel was perfect for our stay. The central location in Dam Square was superb and the rooms were comfortable and even though ours was on the first floor facing Dam Sq, it was very quiet (thanks to sound-proofing). The front desk staff was very helpful. We had not made any Christmas Eve dinner reservations and a young Dutch lady at the front desk was very friendly and helpful in finding us a nice place to have dinner. She was very personable and chatty. The hotel had a free (in Europe you generally have to pay for Internet service, even at hotels) internet and even printing. My boyfriend used the gym once and said it wasnt anything to rave about but it definitely did not put a damper on our stay at the Swissotel. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nothing Swiss about this place. Only good thing is the location. Front desk staff were rude, and the concept of concierge service is foreign to them. The hallways are very old, and the rooms were tiny, dark and are decked out with one of the most unfortunate color schemes I've ever seen. They should redo the whole hotel inside. This is not a hotel designed for pleasure or tourists. I would not stay here again.

<Content>A good choice for Amsterdam In a city of tiny hotel rooms at large prices, this hotel is a good bet. The rooms are not huge but they are Ok sized and comfortable and the have good sized bathrooms and the rooms have everything you need. This is part of the Raffles group and it is sad that their Asian hotels offer so much more for the same price.... But Swisshotel is a good choice in Amsterdam. The concierge is pleasant but not particularly knowledgeable.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This was the third time i have visited Amsterdam and surely the best!! The hotel location is excellent, everything is within walking distance from the hotel, boats, museums, shopping centre, the Red Light District etc. The stuff was extremelly polite and helpfull. The room was very clean and the view over Dam Square was fantastic. Although i have read many reviews about the noise from Dam Square i was never really bothered. If you have the windows from your room open there is some noise but not something terrible. I stayed with my brother in room 515 (Junior Suite) and it was amazing. Next time in Amsterdam i will surely stay again in Swissotel. I heartly recomment this hotel to everyone who wishes to have a pleasent stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Good location but a bit business like My husband and I stayed here from 6/28-7/8 and had a lovely time. The hotel is in a great location, tram is right out front and it was very quiet. The best thing is that they are one of the few hotels in Amsterdam to have air conditioning. It was in the mid 80's and we met other travelers who had uncomfortable nights in other hotels due to the heat. We paid around $200 for the room through Expedia. The staff is very friendly and helpful especially Luigi and Maudy

<Content>Great hotel in a good location for a first visit to Amsterdam I was pleased to find that the poor reviews of this hotel were not true. We had a lovely superior room in a quite location at the back of the hotel (still a good veiw of the church from the window), The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was good with plenty of choice.Given the location of the hotel in the central area the cost was realistic. I would not hesitate to reccomend the hotel if you want to be close to the main sights and the central station (you can walk to the hotel).The coffee maker is a very big bonus!

The first five nights, they did not change the sheets even when they were not clean, then after that they changed the sheets every day, not sure what is the policy

<Content>Think twice, read ALL the negative reviews!! I arrived tired on the train from Paris and was happy to see the hotel was within walking distance from the station. When I waked into the hotel I knew immediately that the huge amount of money ($440 for a superior room) was not going to go very far based on the virtually non-existant lobby. I got to my room and shocked to see the shabbyness of everything. There had been some remodeling done in the last several years but everything was dinged and dented with tacky bedspread and curtains. The view was out a maybe 2 foot wide window of a ventilation stack, I really was horrified since this is the most I have ever paid in my life for a hotel. I had just paid to $295 to stay on the left bank in Paris!This is the first time I felt that Tripadvisor reviews let me down. I try to read between the lines on these things and I really can't understand how for the life of me how someone could give 4 or 5 stars to this hotel. I called Hotel(--) who had booked this for me and luckily was able to cancel the 3 remaining days without penalty. At least with me the staff was very aloof even after Hotels(--) called them to see what could be done for me...no upgrade offer or free breakfast offer..nothing. I ended up moving across the square to a large 4 star hotel for about 30% less money and the room was 30% larger.

<Content>Great hotel, avoid the restaurant Great location right on Dam square, the down side of this is it can be very noisy. There was a fair in the square when we were there and I'm glad we were on the opposite side of the hotel. Staff were very friendly and attentive, even letting me raid an empty room for a better pillow. We were upgraded which I'm sure helped but the room was mordern, clean and well equiped. The restaurant though was dissapointing. Breakfast was expensive and limited and the lunch/evening service was very slow and you were made to feel a like a pest when chasing up a drink. Would stay there again but would find somewhere else to eat.

<Content>a perfect base for amsterdam We have just had 4 nights at the Swissotel and I can highly recommend it as the perfect base to explore amsterdam.The location is fantastic - trams stop outside , a short walk ( 250m) from the canal cruises and the city excursion companies pick up point, 400 m from central station.Room facilities excellent - safe , coffee machine , iron and ironing board , bath robe as well as all the usuals. Our bathroom was spotless and one of the cleanest we have ever had in a hotel. I must say that we were in a superior room and I cannot comment on the standard rooms . Our view was to the alley and hotel next door but the room was very quiet and we had no noise , which is good considering you are right in a central busy part.The staff were polite and really helpful and the concierge was really friendly . The breakfast was AMAZING. What a choice of everything and extremely high quailty. The restaurant and our room had obviously recently been refurbished. The restaurant had excellent decor and was really lovely.For a city break I think this hotel is spot on and our experience here was entirely positive.

Come out of the train station and straight to the top of Damrak and you are there. The hotel is situated on Dam square and handy for all of the sights.There are so many restauarants nearby so we didn't eat in the hotel but it looked nice enough.Staff were very good and upgraded us to a superior room which was excellent and the coffee maker was very good (wanted to bring it home!).If you are looking for a good hotel in a central location, I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location, nice hotel There is no denying that this hotel is in a great location. It's on Dam Square, a short walk from the main train station and canal boat terminus. A number of trams stop just opposite the hotel meaning that you are just steps away from a connection to all parts of the city.Damrak, the street on which the hotel is located, is home to lots of shops of varying quality. Just opposite the hotel is a large, high quality store and there are lots of souvenir shops a few doors away. The very impressive Magna Plaza shopping centre is just around the corner - it's worth a look just for the amazing interior.The hotel is not very impressive looking from the outside - it's quite unassuming - and the reception area is small and unremarkable. We were given a free upgrade from 'standard' rooms to 'superior' rooms. It seems there can be a great difference between the quality of superior rooms. My companion's room was lovely and big, with a large bathroom containing bath and separate shower, seating area for 2 people, and all in all it was a spacious room. My room was a lot smaller, no separate shower and the finish in the room was really poor - dents in the door and wardrobe door, 2 cigarette burns in the bed covers and net curtains. I wasn't very impressed - and probably less so because I'd already seen my companion's room!I was appalled to find that the bin in the room hadn't been emptied and peeping out at me was a porno DVD cover. When I checked the sink in the bathroom, there was a stain so I called reception to complain about the housekeeping service. One of the receptionists came up to see what was wrong, offered me a free drink for the oversight and sent housekeeping to empty the bin. It turned out the stain in the sink was a permanent fixture. I was convinced that this must be a standard rather than superior room, but on checking was assured this was of superior standard ... could have fooled me!I was suprirsed to read negative comments on this website about the soundproofing of the hotel because I found it to be excellent. I'm a very light sleeper and absolutely hate hearing noise from other hotel rooms. This is one of the few times that I can honestly say I didn't hear a sound from any other room. My companion who had the nice room, also had some kind of huge fan - presumably something to do with the air conditioning - just under her window and she had enormous problems getting to sleep, but in my lesser room, I had a great rest! I have to say the beds are very comfortable, there is a great range of channels on the TV - including BBC1 and 2 - and I LOVED the coffee machine in the room. It felt very decadent.The rooms also include a safe, ironing board and iron, mini-bar, 3 telephones (including one in the bathroom), a desk and nice leather chair. Another great feature was the guest office on the first floor which has 2 computers for guests' use and free internet access.As this was to be a relaxing break we decided to take breakfast in bed every morning at a cost of 鈧?0 per time. This was only 鈧? more than the restaurant price for breakfast so seemed worth it. We were very impressed with the lovely range of pastries and bread provided, along with eggs, bacon, coffee, juice and fresh fruit. I'd recommend it!We tried the restaurant for dinner on our first night and it was fine but nothing spectacular. The menu is unremarkable and doesn't change. I wouldn't really recommend it for dinner - you'd be better off finding somewhere out in the city.All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the Swissotel but there definitely are some problems there for the management to address. Staff at the hotel are helpful and courteous. The hotel has been rated 4* and I would say it deserves no more than 3*. However, you can't fault the location or the comfort of the beds and that's the main thing really!

<Content>Mucho Appreciato! Had an awesome time in Amsterdam as I always do. I had taken my Mother with me on this trip and she had arrived from Chicago a very weary traveler. Since no regular rooms were ready when we arrived at 10:00 Am the desk manager was kind enough to upgrade us to a granite covered two room suite for the duration of our trip. Of course as a gentleman I was sure to take good care of the person as I would suggest any courteous traveler who is looking for an upgrade might consider. Fabulous room complete with an endless supply of Lavazza expresso from an automatic machine. Very comfortabe beds. Spotless even in the public areas and located next door to the palace and walking distance to central station. You can catch a train to schipol every 10 or 20 minutes. Catch the local train right out front for a ten minute ride to the museums etc. Flower market is like two blocks away. Will be back here soon! I miss the staff already!

It is right next do Dam Square and the room was very nice and included a kettle for hot drinks which is unusual with European hotels. There is no lobby, you just come in  when you want to use the lift you have to use your room entry card (the card reader for the lift is a bit iffy which can be annoying). We didn't have any breakfast there but did have the roomservice and the meal was fantastic, I really enjoyed it. The rooms are segregated into smoking  non-smoking which is good. It was clean, nicely furnished and overall very pleasant.

<Content>Pack ear-plugs Booked this hotel a month before travelling, having been tempted by the fact that rooms are 'soundproofed' and location is central. The hotel only lived up to the latter of these claims. We arrived at 5pm on Friday 21st April to celebrate a birthday the following day and were allocated a room on the 4th floor, facing the side-street, just off Dam Square - good sized, with a nice bathroom and two single beds, one pillow each. I'd asked for a quiet room, with king sized bed and a view if possible - my priorities were in that order. We got lovely views of the rooftops. But what none of the reviews mention was the carnival/funfair on Dam Square. It's impossible to escape the noise until it stopped at 11:30pm on the Friday night and then again at midnight on Saturday. But below the hotel room is a sidestreet with a Burger King which opens late and must be used as a spot for night-revellers to get a feed. So there was lots of screaming and shouting all night - so on the Friday night we got little or no sleep - it's hard for the hotel to claim the rooms are soundproofed when streetnoise permeates the windows (they might as well have been open all night).The breakfast was not included, but we tried it on the final morning. Arriving 30 mintues before breakfast ceased there was no scambled egg left, the bacon and beans were dried and unappealing so we went for cereals, juice, tea and toast. 鈧?4 euros for two people was a rip off. Go out to the many caf茅s surrounding the hotel for a cheaper alternative (and a better selection).Having paid 鈧?00 for two nights, one of which we barely slept, put a dampener on the birthday celebrations - we were simply exhausted. Not recommended for any light sleepers, or those on trans-Atlantic flights. Unless you pack ear-plugs or sleeping tablets.

<Content>Disappointed We are at last out after a 4-day unpleasant stay. The hotel is far below the level we expected for the amount of money we paid. The room was very modestely furnished and so was the old-fashioned bathroom. Internet connection was out of order and satelitte channels were limited. The hotel has no lobby and the breakfast was less than average with a very limited variety. The street is very noisy. we could hardly sleep day or night. My husband still suffers severe backache because of the unhealthy mattress. The only bright side was the kind and smiling staff. I wish them all the best, probably in a higher standard hotel where they will definely fit better. I do not recommend this hotel in spite of its central location. Trams and taxis are available.

<Content>Best Pick for Proximity to All I stayed at the Swissotel Amsterdam last week for 8 days for vacation. It was my first trip to Amsterdam and I wanted to be close to all of the attractions. This hotel is in the heart of Dam Square, 10 minutes from Centraal Station and everywhere else we wanted to go.The rooms were cleaned twice a day and the staff was so kind and helpful. I saw the other review that said this hotel was cold and unfeeling, but I am a frequent business traveler and I saw it as warm and inviting. The bathroom had a separate shower stall and bath. We didn't stay in a room overlooking the Square and the room was quiet. I definitely recommend the Swissotel for travelers looking for the true Amsterdam experience and I thank the staff for their wonderful service.

<Content>Mediocre at best.... I am a frequent traveler to Amsterdam. For my latest trip, I choose the Swissotel Amsterdam.From the moment I walked into the room, I was not thrilled...This was a quiet weekend in Amsterdam, but my so-called junior suite was not up to par. The room was in the rafters, small, carpeted and not at all like the attractive room with hardwood floors advertised. The room also reeked of smoke. The staff for the most part seemed ditzy and unfocused. In fact, someone from the States attempted to call me during my stay, only to have hotel staff tell them that I was definitely not a guest at the hotel. There was a speaker in the bathroom that broadcast the television feed; the sound quality was horrible. Good luck trying to take a shower in the treacherous stall with curved glass doors. This was not a place to which I am likely to return.

<Content>Good experience with the lovely Swissotel Amsterdam I and my travel companions spent 5 nights at the Swissotel Amsterdam in March 2006. All in all, this was a good pick for us. The location could be no better, what with Dam Square and the city's trams at the hotel's front door. There are tons of shopping and dining options within a very short distance of the hotel. All major sites are within walking distance, or are accessed quickly via the city's tram network (which again stops in front of the hotel). Admittedly, this is a business class hotel, so despite that facility being very clean and modern, it nevertheless felt somewhat cold and generic. Rooms however were of a good size. Do note that should your room be at or near the front of the hotel, street noise (especially the trams) can be heard in the room with the window(s) closed. This is not a sound-proofed building. My travel party occupied 2 rooms during our visit. I was in a room near the front of the building, hence the noise previously described. My companions occupied a room near the rear of the building with a view on to an inner courtyard-type space. Their room was totally noise-free. I would like to make special mention of the hotel staff. Everyone employed by the hotel that we had contact with throughout our stay was very polite and very helpful. The front desk staff in particular were always knowledgable, helpful, and friendly. Also, the hotel's Business Center offered 2 computers with free internet access. This was a great feature that our travel party greatly appreciated. Should you stay at the Swissotel Amsterdam? Definite yes if traveling for business. As for the pleasure traveler, I would give the hotel an overall 8.5 out of 10.

<Content>Very Happy I had a very nice stay at this hotel. Sprang for the junior suite which was enormous by Dutch standards. The glass bathroom is neat and the view onto Dam Square is outstanding. The staff really is wonderful. They let me check in many hours early which I greatly appreciated. The free internet access is a real boon. Unlike the other poster I was very happy with the quality of my room and felt it was very clean and exactly as depicted in the photos.My only caveats are first that it's really a business hotel and you can feel that in the atmosphere and the prices. Second, it really is loud with the trams and people right outside your window. It's nice to be right in the middle of everything - made stopping back to the room with packages or to use the bathroom very easy. But the noise is something to be considered before booking.

<Content>Great Choice A three night midweek stay in Amsterdam led myself and fiance to the Swissotel. We were upgraded to the Executive suite which was absolutely amazing! Spotless clean and all the extra's you could ever want: 2 flatscreen TV's with sky TV, DVD player, fancy coffee making machine, mini-bar, slippers, robes, complimentary toiletries etc. View of Dam square amazing ! The staff were extremley friendly, and helpful. A wee bit on the pricey side, but I'd say totally worth every penny !!

<Content>Great Location Wow !! What a gem of a hotel. I spent 4 nights at the Swissotel in March in the Junior suite and can say it was the best quality hotel I have ever stayed in.First of all the location is perfect for centre of Amsterdam. Its on the corner of Dam square and the Damrak and our room overlooked Dam square. Basically this is the centre of the City and is filled with Bars, shops and is a short walk from Anne Franks house and the station.The suite was massive, the hotel was so clean you could eat your meals of the wooden floor (if thats your thing) and the service was first class. It was also cheap for a suite and we got it at a reduced price, do dev worth checking out.Bad Points - The only ones I can think of is the glass door in the suite which dosnt move and the shower door is unfrosted glass (ok if your not bashful), also you dont get breakfast included in price.But dont let this put you off one bit as everything else was perfect

<Content>smelly room I have stayed at the Swissotel in Amsterdam previously in one of their superior rooms and it was totally different to the standard room we were given this time around. On arrival we were greeted with the stench of rotten tobacco and a sunken double bed that had seen far better days. The carpet was covered in stains and pot burns and the lace on the windows was grey and also dotted with pot burns.The two padded chairs in the room were covered in stains.The cushions on the bed also were smothered in stains. If you stay at the swissotel be sure to avoid room 217 i am sure they have this one down as the stoners suite for people they don't like or don't expect to return to their hotel! On the upside the staff are always kind and welcoming and they can't do enough to make your stay as pleasant as possible. There is a good view from the window of Dam Square and the breakfast is buffet style so you do get value for money even if people baulk at the price. It makes sense to help yourself rather than pay 5 euros outside for a tiny breakfast.

<Content>ideal hotel We stayed at the swissotel for 2 nights and would certainly stay there again. We booked a superior room overlooking dam square and although some reviews state that there is noise to be heard I have to say the only noise we heard were the trams ringing which did not bother us and soon got used to. Hotel was very high standard - very clean rooms. All staff we spoke to were couteous and very helpful. I don't think I could praise them enough. look out for deals as the room we stayed in was 350 euros per night if you walked in from of the street. We did have breakfast at the hotel which was good but could have been taken elsewhere for a little less but often tea and coffee was not included so that would have put price up.

<Content>Didn't live up to trip advisor expectations Don't get me wrong, the location was fantastic and we had a great view overlooking the square. What I wasn't prepared for was the constant loud noise of the trams. Although the windows were double glazed, the noise at time was awful.Friendly staff who couldn't do enough to help but it would have been nice if the rooms were as plush as the hotel lobby and the food was very expensive.The very large bed was great although the pillows were quite flat and the room was dissapointingly outdated, although clean.Majestics across the sq is ok to eat and Gauchos is a must for a very nice steak. I would avoid the tourist eateries like the plague.Louis bar or the smallest pub in town is great and I would recommend venturing off the beaten track for real Dutch pancakes!

<Content>Brilliant Hotel We stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon and i was nervous about staying here as i had booked it online. It was delightful - very central to everywhere. The room we stayed in was large and airy and i loved coming back to the room each night to find the bed turned down and two mini toblerones on each pillow. Had breakfast in the restaurant on our first morning there but i didn't think it was worth the money but that was just us we didn't like the food there was and we were able to go to a juice bar or a bakery or grocers and get something far cheaper and much more to our taste.i would definately go back here again.

<Content>100% understanding I am writing to let all future Swissotel guests how grateful I am for the understanding of the staff at the Swissotel. My husband and I were meant to travel to Amsterdam last week but unfortunately had to cancel our vacation due to work committments. When I booked the hotel, I was informed of the cancellation fee, but when I came to cancelling, the staff did not charge me for the cancellation. Instead I was met by understanding and a kind voice who told me that they will be happy to have us when we can finally make it Amsterdam. We will make it to Amsterdam soon and I am more than certain that we will stay with Swissotel, especially after being treated like this. I stay in many hotels over the world and I can say, not many people are as understanding as this, they normally only care about the money. Clearly Swissotel aim to please and put your mind at ease that they are there to welcome you, not just take your money. Thankyou Swissotel Amsterdam

<Content>Comfortable room, perfect location I spent six nights at the Swissotel Amsterdam and enjoyed every one. The hotel is about 1/2 mile from the train station and central to everything. Our room was tastefully decorated and had a very comfortable bed (pillows were a little flat). The room had no view to speak of, but the hallway outside had a lovely view. The business center has two computers with FREE high-speed Internet (something nobody told us and until the last day, we'd been walking about 1/4 mile to the inexpensive Internet cafe). A little grocery store (similar to 7-11) was a few doors down so we were able to stock up on snacks, sodas, and bottled water.

<Content>Great Location, central to everywhere. An okay hotel. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is located just off Dam Square. As you come out of the hotel, if you look to the right, Dam Square is no more than a minutes walk away. The hotel upgraded us free of charge as this trip was for my husband's 40th Bithday to a Superior Room. The rooms were compact, however it did have a super king size bed in it. The hotel provides all the facilities as listed by them on line. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was 鈧?0 per head per morning. You can get a substantial breakfast for 鈧?-9 in many other little 'eateries'. I would stay here again, but having fathomed out the trams and bus boats, I wouldn't be against trying other hotels with-in a 1km distance, as you would still be fairly in the thich of it.A lovely city, felt very safe walking around here.

<Content>A Suite Place to Stay Just arrived home from Amsterdam, and the Swisshotel's Suite overlooking Dam Square, Room 407.Look out for deals on this if you can as the extra money spent is worth every cent. From entering your suite, down the stairs into the cloak space, past the open plan dining area with table for 6, into the enormous Living area with DVD, satellite tv, everything you'd need for a home-from-home, through the wooden slide doors into the bedroom with the biggest bed we've ever seen (including a fortuitously placed and very large leather footstool at the end - very nice), thro glass sliding doors into the biggest bathroom in the world complete with spa bath, shower, 2 sinks and the hardest water pressure in Europe, you'll be completely convinced that this is the pefect place to have a wicked time in a great city.Staff were unfailingly helpful, whether they were spotlessly and discreetly cleaning your rooms, answering questions at 2am, turning down your bed complete with chocolates and water, delivering a delicious room-service meal to eat on your HUGE dining table, or taking your credit card details at the end of a wonderful stay.If you want a relaxing stay, right at the heart of whatever you fancy in Amsterdam, come here!

<Content>Swissotel to the rescue My husband and I went for a 2 night break to Amsterdam which started terrible. I booked a 3* hotel on the internet from a well known hotel website so we had no reason to expect to find a room which was the size of a box and the only view a brick wall where you couldn't open the window. No way could we spend 5 mins there never mind 2 nights so off we went to seek further accomadation.A friend had told me she had stayed in the Swissotel a few years ago so we headed there.The staff were so friendly on arrival and the only room available was a suite. The suite was beautiful, clean and the view was looking right over Dam Square. We had all our meals in the hotel restaurant which were delicious and great value.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying in Amsterdam. There is nothing I could fault, the staff were so friendly, the food excellent and everywhere in walking distance even the train station which brings you staight back to the airport.

<Content>Good choice The hotel is situated perfectly for those who is visiting Amsterdam for the first time. We took a KLM shuttle( there were only 3 passengers, 17 Eu return) from the airport and in 20 minutes we found us just in front of the hotel. Our standart room was rather tiny but clean and comfortable. We didn't tried breakfast there but found excellent places to eat in that area. The staff was helpful and friendly. But I would call it 3 stars though due to the size of rooms.

<Content>The Best end to my trip After 3 weeks travelling in Europe in 3 star hotels, we were exhausted when we arrived in Amsterdam. We thought we would treat ourselves to a better hotel in this city, but nothing prepared us for the JOY when we arrived in this hotel!!Outstanding service, the BEST huge modern room with an enormous bed. Luxurious and spotlessly clean and . The bathroom was a little small but we didn't care because it was luxurious and modern there was a huge bath.Central trams right outside the door, walking distance to good sites and a great view of Dam Square.Was exensive but we thought it was worth every cent. (free internet access too) HIGHLY recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved the Jr Suite and Great Location !! We stayed 4 nights, oct 9-12th 2005 and had the junior suite on the top floor. The suite, which was more like an apartment than a hotel room, had all hard wood floors, a big beautiful all glass bathroom with separate shower, toilet and bath, slippers and robes. Great flat screen tv, king bed, couch, desk, a perfect view over looking the Dam, down the block from Central Station so you can walk after taking the train from the airport  very nice staff. I would definately stay here again and take the same room. The hotel was very clean, all staff very attentive and worth every penny. Perfect location to boot. Tram stops outside the front door of the lobby.

<Content>Not Great - Not bad either Started my europe trip here at the Swiss hotel. The location is unbeatable. The staff was nice and the hotel was clean. The air conditioning does not work that well. It was a bit noisy due to the location on dam square. The rooms were larger than most we staying in europe. The breakfast was a total rip off!! Do not eat there, they charged us 40 euro for two people and the food was average. So my rating is average, not the best hotel, but also not the worst. If I were to do it again I would stay in a quiet hotel in the canal somewhere. Most everything is walking distance. Amsterdam was a blast.

<Content>Loved the location We booked the Swissotel direct online with the hotel (as recommended bya previous Trip Advisor report) for a 4 night weekend stay. My husband and I took his mother for a sightseeing trip to Amsterdam to celebrate her 85th birthday. We wanted a central hotel with good facilities. We obtained a business rate with breakfast and a guaranteed refurbished room, which were both excellent. Although the rooms had no views, they were spacious and comfortable with very acceptable extras such as a large bowl of fruit, bathrobes, tea/coffee making facilities and iron  ironing board. The staff in the hotel could not have been more helpful. For my mother-in-law's convenience due to her age, we took a taxi from the airport each way, which cost 45 euros and both drivers expected a 5 euro tip! A little excessive we thought. Had we been on our own, we would have taken the train to Central Station and walked to the Hotel, which was only about a 10/15 minute walk away. We were central to everything in Amsterdam - tram stop across the road - and the report which complained about the non-nearness of the canals had a different view to ours. There was only a 10 minute walk along Damrak either way to reach the canals and those by Central Station included all the canal boat excursions you could have wished. We had a evening meal in the hotel's adjoining Dam Plaza restaurant which was very good and we also dined in the restaurant of De Roode Leeuw two doors away and the Restaurant Reflet in the Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky across the square, both of which were excellent. We did the evening dinner canal cruise which was a little expensive at over 60 euros, but could not be faulted for the atmosphere and experience. The tour company offices for excursions, booked for us by the friendly Hotel staff, were just across Dam Square, which was also very convenient. The Panoramic City tour, which finished at the Diamond factory, was very disappointing and not worth the money but the trip to Volendam and Marken was very good in terms of value and content. We also enjoyed sitting outside in the warm evening temperatures in the bar of the Dam Plaza with the very friendly barmen and people watching all the activities in Dam Square. A most enjoyable experience and we would recommend the Swissotel as a very good hotel to stay at for a weekend break in Amsterdam - just insist on the refurbished rooms!

<Content>Characterless hotel with average facilities The hotel was very central (off Dam Square and near the central railway station), but not on or particularly near to a canal. Decor was bland and businesslike, with no sense of being in Holland. For business use, it was fine (and there's a free computer room for guests on the 1st floor), but if you're there for tourism you might want something with some character. I was put in a small, dark, smoking room (which smelled of smoke), but got changed to a larger room on the third floor (only three floors are non-smoking). The room was spacious, but the view was of a wall and had little natural light. This seems to be typical of most of the rooms, unless you go for a suite. There was still an ingrained smell of smoke in the room, even though it was non-smoking, and there were two cigarette burns on the bedspread. The staff were very helpful, and the breakfast was good (though it wasn't included in the room rate, and cost an extra 20 euros). Breakfast isn't available as room service. All in all, this is an adequate hotel, but I'm surprised it's part of the Raffles International group of hotels, as it was very functional and in need of a facelift.

The location is superb right by Dam square with many great bars and restuarants only a short walk. It only took about 15 mins to walk from central station. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and our room was excellent with all amenities and a huge ensuite. Everything was extremely clean and tidy, would definately return again.

<Content>Nice clean hotel The hotel was very clean and tidy and the staff very helpful. Myself and our two children had two rooms and I was pleased with the hotel. The only downside was that for a family it was to close to the red light district and at night the area outside was a scruffy. Overall I found Amsterdam intersting but four days was a sufficient stay. It would be unlikely that I would return.

<Content>GUTTED!!!!!!! After staying at Swiss Hotel Berlin, i must admit, i had high expectations. On entering the lobby i was sure i'd made the rights choice, how wrong could i possible be?! As the door to my standard room swung open, my excitement disappeared, my eyes welled up  i couldn't stop the tears! The walls were dull  stained with peeling paper, bathroom was shabby/dirty to say the least, the bed covers were old  worn, the bed uncomfortable, the net curtains dirty, the lighting completely useless!Got a peak inside one of the Junior suits which looked as described in the reviews, maybe there's hope for this place yet????'Great Location' is the only good comment i can make with about this hotel.:O(

Free safe, iron, etc. Bathroom was very nice and had a great shower over the bath.Staff were efficient, if not overly friendly. Some noise from trams outside but no major problem. Only fault was being given a smoking room without any choice. Overall, we would stay here again especially at the room rates.

We had a deluxe, recenty renovated room which faced out onto Dam Square - a lovely view to watch the world go by and to people spot. It was very clean and tidy, decent size and a really nice bathroom. The room had a safe, iron, ironing board, mini-bar, coffee making facitities and a good range of tv channels. We had a rate which included breakfast and there was wide selection of food available - good value for money. Also, free internet access with printing facities - handy if you want to check in online for your flight which we did.We tried the hotel restaurant and the food was lovely with a wide selection of dishes. We would definitely stay in this hotel again... no complaints at all.

<Content>Nice hotel but only give it 3 stars out of 5 My husband and I stayed at the Swisshotel for three nights in March 2005, over Easter weekend so maybe that is why I cannot give this hotel rave reviews. Everyone was extremely busy. We reserved a junior suite and although I'm not sure what I expected, it was below the standard I was expecting for the price we paid. My negative comments are as follows: we arrived early by train and were told that the room wasn't ready as a frequent guest had requested late checkout. We were able to leave our bags with the concierge, however. We returned to the hotel about 3:30PM and our room still wasn't ready so we were offered a complimentary beverage in the bar. We were finally able to check-in a little after 4PM. The floor was sort of a wooden parquet but very dull and didn't look clean. In fact, my husband had to call housekeeping to come up and clean something that had been spilled on the carpet. The bedding looked rumpled and not fresh and clean. There was some debris left in a cupboard by a previous occupant which again led me to believe that the room had not been properly cleaned. When we went to check out there was a major rain downpour. Granted the hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the train station but the point is that the concierge did not go out of his way to provide us assistance, i.e. no offer of a hotel umbrella, etc. The tram stopped just outside the door but there was no cover near the tracks where we would have to wait and impossible for taxis to come or so said the concierge. If I were still 20 years old this would have been a great adventure to trek through the rain but we are in our mid-50's and for the price we paid for a supposed 5 star hotel, we felt that they could have done better in assisting us. We didn't eat there so I cannot comment on the food.Probably the best thing about this hotel is its location, right on Dam Square. Our room had a view and given the activity on Easter weekend, it was fun to watch. The bathroom was nice enough, but again, after you've stayed at the Shangri-La Kowloon in Hong Kong for example, well this hotel just didn't measure up in terms of service or amenities.Overall, if you can get a good price for a room it's okay and safe but we won't be staying there again. Sorry.

<Content>Great potential, unrealized I too arrived at the Sofitel with high expectations. The website photos looked great and the staff had responded to all of my email requests quickly and graciously. Traveling with friends, we booked a superior room at a rate of 185E and an executive suite at a rate of 295E. for a four night stay.I arrived around 10am, pleased to discover the hotel was honoring my request for an early check-in. The process was quick, the staff very friendly. Unfortunately, my happiness level decreased when I saw my suite. I was located on the 6th floor overlooking Dam Square. Decorated as you see in the web photos with blonde and dark woods, the tiny living area was about 7-8 feet with a small sofa, chair, desk and built in cabinet with an expresso maker, minibar and tv. The promised cd player was missing. There was a small doorway to the bedroom just barely holding a king-sized bed with another small doorway to a bathroom. Very small, almost like regular room but cut into two compartments. I called the front desk and commented that the suite seemed very different from the one shown on the website which contained a table and chairs. I was told that I'd been given one of the largest suites. This, I learned later, was not true. The second room wasn't ready until later in the day. We appreciated that the staff had provided a room right across the hall from the suite, facing the back of the hotel. It was a tad dark but otherwise fine with the same blonde/dark wood decor. The bathroom was spacious with a very large bathtub and very clean. It closely resembled the website photo.The hotel is located on Dam Square across from the Royal Palace and just a few blocks from Central Station, the center of tourist mecca. The Grand Krasnapolsky is across the square and the Hotel Amsterdam is next door. The tram stops right in front of the hotel with additional stops for other routes very close by. This makes the hotel very convenient. You can hop on a tram or you can walk to your destinations. We walked everywhere, had a fun dinner and walked back to the hotel with no problems.The suite was claustrophobic to sleep in and the noise of Dam Square made it impossible to keep the windows open. The tram bells proved to be the greatest challenge. A housekeeper showed us a junior suite the next morning and, at our request, the hotel allowed us to move into it, generously lowering our rate to 225E. A VAST IMPROVEMENT over the suite. The junior suite is about the same size but without the wall that creates the separate living area. The bathroom wall is made of glass, which adds to the feel of spaciousness. The junior suite is larger than the superior room and not as dark. Bottom line: skip the executive suite and get a junior suite. Request the 07 suites.. rooms 207-507. They are the best with a tiny set of stairs into a room with a beamed ceiling. We didn't land one of these junior suites but the housekeepers recommend them. They also recommend the suites on the opposite corner of the building. I think they are rooms 217-517 but I may be off. Apparently these are junior suites as well the larger one bedroom suites. They also have a tiny set of stairs into the room and come with tiny balconies overlooking Dam Square. If you book with Swissotel, email the hotel and request these corner rooms.Breakfast came with our rate but we only ate in the hotel a couple of times. The breakfast is good, with a variety of breads, pastries, cereals, cheeses, smoked fish, eggs, bacon, sausage, coffee and fresh juices. But there are so many other places you can go and if breakfast is not included, you have to pay 20E which is too much in comparison with all of the nearby cafes. I was also a bit outraged that the hotel charged my friend 20E for the 'breakfast' on the morning of our arrival when all she had was a cup of coffee and roll while she waited for me to put my things into my suite. Other observations: the rooms have AC but it does not always work very well. You cannot leave your windows open because of the noise so the rooms can get a bit stuffy. The decor is very pleasant and contemporary, Definitely a step above many of the other hotels in the area, but even recently renovated rooms have a bit of a 'worn' feel. The beautiful wood floor of the junior suite was badly stained in one area, truly a shame. The housekeeping staff is top knotch. The rooms are very clean and the bathrooms are spotless. The staff overall is very accommodating although one person left us cold. The internet access offered from the rooms is spotty. I could not get it to work and could not get someone from the staff to help me. I had to resort to the business center computers. Also, the crowds of tourists during the day wear you down quickly and the street toward Central Station is a bit seedy at night. I think it is because the hotel is very close to the Red Light District. The hotel has great potential. You really want to like it with its upscale room decor.. central location.. pleasant staff.. and clean enormous bathrooms. Hotels often grow on me after I get past the biasness of my expectations. Unfortunately, this one did not. I doubt I will stay there again. After walking around Amsterdam, I think I will sacrifice the 'great location' on Dam Square for the charm of the canals and more 'residential' areas. I am more likely to stay at a place like the Ambassade for less money, more charm and a bit of quiet.

<Content>Location location but..... Great location situated on Dam Square and within easy reach of all the museums and usual sights. The staff were very friendly, the rooms spacious and clean with an ample bathroom. We had a smoking room, not by choice, on the 2nd floor that looked out onto the Square and it was very noisy at night. The room wasn't soundproofed and when the drunks had stopped singing and arguing below the road sweepers and cleaners took over at 5am. Not much sleep! All in all, a great location in a great city, but just another hotel room. Nothing special for the price.

Staff were very friendly and helpful, hotel was very clean - couldn't have asked for more. When we arrived there were no standard rooms left so we were upgraded! The restaurant served good food and it was great to be able to sit outside and watch the world go by! The location is perfect with Dam Square and the Royal Palace just outside and only a 5 minute walk from Central Station and the Canal Cruises. We will come back to Swissotel again - can't wait! 10 out of 10!

<Content>Great Location Just got back from a 5 night stay at the Swissotel. We picked this hotel because other reviewers said it was in a convenient location, and it was. We stayed in a standard room because we knew we were going to be out most of the day anyway. The room was decent; just don't expect any views out the window. However, it was very quiet though, which was a plus. In addition, we were able to check in at 11am after a long flight from NY. Overall, we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Excellent Excellent!!! We have just arrived from a business trip to Amsterdam. We paid for a Superior Room but they gave us a Junior Suite because it was our first time to Amsterdam (at least that's what they said). The location was excellent and no taxi was needed since everything was in walking distance from the hotel. The room was luxury with oversized bathroom and a huge bed but very clean above all. Our bedroom was overlooking the Dam Square. Every single staff was friendly and always willing to help you. Swissotel is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. I would definetely go again!

<Content>Birthday weekend Hotel is in an excellent location, staff very helpful and friendly speak to them about any trips you may want to plan as they may have discount vouchers.we were upgraded to a superior room which was excellent, the only downside was the lack of view. the 1st floor has been recently renovated if you can get a room on that floor it would be a bonus.restaurant is clean friendly lacking in atmosphere and quite expensive but very tasty. i would definately return to this hotel.

<Content>Perfect for a weekend in Amsterdam This hotel was in a perfect location for exploring Amsterdam. Right on Dam Square and at bottom of Damrak. Really easy for everything. Only negative was room was tiny but we got a cheap-ish deal and we spend little time in rooms so not a problem for us. Clean. Friendly and informative staff. FANTASTIC LOCATION.Will go again.

<Content>Fantastic! We spent a week at the Swissotel on Dam Square in March, 2005. We booked it through a package deal w/Expedia so I'm not sure exactly how much we paid - but it couldn't have been much because the package itself was very inexpensive. Everything about this hotel is top notch. The location can't be beat. Having stayed there for a week, we interacted with a few people at the front desk. Every single staff person was always friendly and helpful. Our room was like new - very European hip. We found it plenty spacious (superior room). Probably the best shower ever in a hotel room! Heated towel rack! And the espresso machine was a godsend. I honestly can't think of anything negative to say. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a clean, safe, friendly hotel in a superb, central location.

<Content>Fabulous Junior Suite We stayed here in 2003 in a junior suite and our room was bright and spatious. Lovely wood floors, comfy king bed, oversized bathroom with swiss bath products and a great view of dam square with large windows. We really loved everything about our room, but here is the however. On our last night when returning to our room in the afternoon while the room was being serviced, from outside the room I saw one of the maids cleaning our coffee cups in the bathroom sink. I witnessed her spitting in the cup to 'polish' it up. Not sure why I didn't bring this up to management at the time as I normally would (in a rage), but this is preventing me from staying here again. I also was able to see a standard room that a friend was staying in on the top floor and it was nice as well, though smaller. It had exposed beams in the ceiling and less windows so kind of dark. Though I'd stay in one of those rooms if needed. Especially liked that we were able to check in early (10am) and were brought a plate of fresh fruit on arrival. Overall I wish I could bring myself to stay here again if it weren't for the spit thing. ...And the Internet access was 25 Euros a day which was ridiculous, but needed.

<Content>Super Swiss! We have just returned from a long weekend stay in Amsterdam, during which we stayed at the Swissotel. Everything about our stay was excellent. You couldn't have been in a better location, it was close to central station, red light district, public transport (right outside!), bars and restaurants and coffee shops! From the minute we arrived the staff went out of their way to be helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were comfortable and very well equiped, we were upgraded from a standard to a superior without even asking, and when we asked if we could upgrade to a junior suite the concierge managed to get us moved without delay. The junior suite was possibly the nicest room I have ever stayed in and even had a dvd player. Room service was also avaliable and the food we tried was very nice. We have already recommended this hotel to others and will certainly be staying at the Swissotel on our next visit to Dam.

<Content>Wish I could stay forever I just spent 6 days at the Swissotel. This was my fourth trip to Amsterdam, and this hotel is by far the best I have stayed in. Situated right off Dam sqare, a couple of minutes walk in either direction to the Central station, red light district, shopping streets and coffeshops, this hotel has the best location available. Last time, I stayed at the Krasnopolski just across the square, but this hotel has a more charming and relaxed atmosphere. I booked a superior room, the only difference from a standard room being a state of the art coffe machine, a bathtub and a bathrobe. The diner on the ground floor looks fancy, but turned out quite average, both in terms of service and food. Prices, on the other hand, tend to be well above average. Bearing in mind the vast number of steakhouses and small restaurants just outside your doorstep, I suggest you spend your time and money elswere. At first I got a rom with view straight into next door brick wall, but when I complained and said I didn't fancy that view for a whole week, they swiftly found another room and moved our luggage over. The rooms are very nice with designer furniture, ironing bord, wireless internet access etc. The cleaners didn't miss a spot during my whole stay. Nothing more to say really. I finally found the perfect hotel in Amsterdam, and it was more sad than ever to leave this wonderful, wonderful city.

<Content>Wonderful! A lovely little classy gem 8 minutes walk from the Centraal Train Station. The area around it is a tad seedy, however once inside the hotel it is heaven. My non-smoking room was hugely comfortable on the 6th floor, very quiet, with a great King size bed and bathroom and an expresso coffee maker that could also make tea. They also offer free internet access to their guests in a cute little business centre on the 1st floor (2nd in North America). The rate including taxes but excluding breakfast was Euros140 and well worth it. It is handy to everything and has a couple of excellent restaurants next to it. The Roode Leeuw (The Red Lion) is next door and is a classic of good cuisine and a few doors further down is a good Indonesian restaurant (The Sukasari) that does a good Rijsttafel (Rice Table) which is a dinner that consists of 21 varied little dishes. Swissotel is a real find for comfort and convenience.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, conveniently located. Stayed there in mid-December 2004 and loved it. Was able to walk my roller-suitcase to the hotel, from the Central train station, with ease. Lots of smooth surfaces and none of the cobblestone issues you are met with in some older cities in Europe. Sure, there are a few curbs to go over, but nothing difficult at all. The hotel is on the right side of the street (if heading away from the train station) and close to most everything you will want to see. Admittedly, you could use the trams, but I walked everywhere. It's about 20 minutes or so to the museums, mere minutes to the Red Light District, maybe 10 minutes from the train station. The rooms are in good condition. Staff is friendly, professional and (as with just about every establishment in Amsterdam) completely fluent in English. As a woman traveling alone, I felt completely safe and well cared for. I'd definitely stay there again!

<Content>Loved the Swisshotel We just returned from spending 11 nights at the Swissotel over the holidays, including New Years Eve. We couldn't have picked a better place. After just a five minute walk from the train station, even though we arrived at 8:30 in the morning we were able to check into our room right then. The room was spotless and much larger than we expected, and very quiet. In addition, it had an espresso/cappucino machine which provided us with unlimited coffee/tea (just ask the maid for extra and they'll happily oblige). We weren't even in the room for 20 minutes and a guest services person knocked on our door to welcome us with a large Toblerone bar and to make sure everything was okay. The desk clerks were all very nice when we went down later on, and they gave us a map as well as a lot of good information about getting the Amsterdam pass and so on. The hotel also has an excellent business center on the first floor with free internet access as well as a printer and fax machine. Every single person who worked at the hotel always said hello, helped us locate places on the map, and even made suggestions about things to do. The restaurant food is fairly priced and pretty good. However, be careful about the tuna, as they tend to over cook it. Great veggies! The location couldn't be better, right in Dam Square. We are definitely planning to return to Amsterdam and we will definitely stay at this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, Rated 4 Star but should be Rated a 5 Star. First off, I am a travel agent who only been on cruises and to countries all over the Caribbean. This was my first trip to Europe and I decided to make it a vacation trip to get the tourist experience. When I first arrived at the main Central Station and walked outside, I walked into a full blown CITY. I certainly didn't expect to see anything like that so you can imagine the culture shock for me. I am from NYC, but I only expected to see canals and historical buildings so I was pleasantly surprised. As we walked straight down the street to find our hotel, I was also pleased that Swissotel was right on the main strip and close to all the malls, souvenir stores and restaurants. It was approximately a 5-10 mins. walk to the hotel and it was VERY easy to find. When I walked in I was assisted by the concierge desk to be checked in immediately by just giving my name. I asked for the gentleman who did my reservations to thank him for everything and he was still there working late as usual. The hotel staff was very cordial and welcoming which I appreciated being that I did not speak the language and it was a new surrounding for me. I was given a map during my check in and the front desk guy pointed out the main points of the city and what trams (which are all right outside the hotel) will take me there which was very helpful. The Hotel:After checking in, you must have your card key at all times for this hotel because to prevent outside people from every getting into the hotel or elevator you need a key for that also. It is for security purposes because the hotel is right in busy time square so I was happy with that also. The hotel room is VERY modern and unlike any 4 star hotels I stayed in. When you enter with your key, you MUST leave it inside a slot by the door in order for the lights to come on. (Another security measure) The TV was on when I entered and my name was on the screen welcoming me, which gave the room a personal touch. I stayed in a superior room which is online and it was very spacious for my cousin and I since we are both females and need it. The bed was huge and can also be separated into twin beds; their is a huge coffee maker like the one in my office where you don't need to add water as it is permanently connected to a system, hidden fridge with a fully stocked bar (snacks, candy, liquor and other drinks) at a charge. The bathroom is VERY stylish and the cleanest I have ever seen, you can tell this hotel was recently remodeled. There is a phone in the bathroom as well as surround sound in the ceiling for anything being played on the TV in the bedroom. The hotel supplies the guest with a bathrobe, iron w/board and lots of storage with closet space which we utilized to the max. Service: The front desk, concierge and housekeeping are ALWAYS at your disposal and will assist by the touch of a button. I have NEVER had service that good that it was scary. On our first morning, I called to ask how to operate the coffee maker because as I said it was not a normal one. Instead of giving me instructions the concierge came upstairs personally in less that 1 minute and did it for us. I was shocked out of my wits when I called room service for extra sugar and cream and they came instantly. If you want better service than that, I think you need to hire a servant. LOL!Honestly readers, I don't need to give more detail of my experience at this hotel because it was all FIRST Class for me and I stayed at many name brand hotel chains all over the US and never got superb service like I did at Swissotel. I read a couple of the recent complaints and I believe some is exaggerated and not as critical as some other situations people could have received. For seriously PRIME location to EVERYTHING, excellent service and comfortable stay this is the place to be. ENJOY your stay at the Swissotel, where everything for me was done with a personal touch.

<Content>Great Hotel Just got back from a weekend break at the Swissotel in Amsterdam. We stayed in a standard room (226) and had our reservations from reading previous message on here. We were however pleasantly surprised. The room was not big, but the bed was huge, I'm 6'1'' and could easily lay sideways on the bed!! The bathroom was clean with a full size bath and powerful shower.The rest of the hotel was ok, we were on the second floor and it did look a little shabby in the corridors. We didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant and only had a couple of drinks in the bar so can't comment on those too much. It is in a great location within easy walking of all main attractions and really near to tram stops that can take you pretty much anywhere else.We would definitely go back to Amsterdam and probably stay at the Swissotel again.

<Content>Junior suites are wonderful! We stayed at the Swissotel in late September, and the junior suite was LOVELY! Bathroom to die for. HUGE, marble, separate bathtub, water closet. We did have to move to a standard room when we extended our stay and it was very small and faced a brick wall (literally could almost touch it if we put our arm out the window). I highly recommend the hotel if you can swing the junior suite prices...location was terrific too.

Be sure to search the Internet for the best rate. My first quote was 169 euros but my persistence at searching the Internet helped me find a rate of 99 euros for the same room.

<Content>Excellent !!! Been there 6 times already and going back I have stayed in many hotels in Amsterdam before I found the Swissotel.I was never happy with any of the others and was thrilled to find the Swissotel.It is located right in Dam Square near everything. The staff is polite and very helpful. We are headed there again in a few days and they have reserved my same room as always and will have it ready with certain requests. You can not go wrong by staying here. Nobody is perfect and from time to time things happen but overall I rate them a solid A+.Don't sweat it, this is the place to stay.RickFt Lauderdale, Florida

<Content>Dude, it was perfect Stayed there for 4 nights at the end of Sep 04'. It was perfect. There is a tram stop right in front of the place. The location was perfect, tons of restaurants, bars, coffeeshops, etc. around the corner. Not only did you need a room key to get into the hotel, you also needed a room key to use the elevator (great security). The staff was great too. At 4am our mini-bar was empty and the front desk brought up a 12 pack of Heineken upon our request. Red Light District was about 4 blocks away yet the hotel is in a major square that was extremely safe. There is also an ATM machine right outside the door of the hotel. My buddy bought an $800 watch from the jewelry store inside the hotel. The whole place was classy and affordable. Just an FYI - you'll pay more for an Orange Juice than you will a beer in Amsterdam.

<Content>Excellent hotel in a wonderful city Before booking my trip to Amsterdam, I read all the reviews of Swissotel here on this site and must admit I was a bit worried by some of the negativity. However, the establishment is usually highly recommended and, after e-mailing the hotel to confirm the building works have now been completed, I had no hesitation in booking my stay at the Swissotel.One of the greatest advantages of the hotel is its location on Dam Square. It is literally a 5 minute walk from Centraal Station, which has frequent trains to and from the airport (about one every 10 minutes). You just head out the main exit of the station and walk straight down the Damrak - a busy, vibrant street full of shops and restaurants. The hotel itself doesn't have a restaurant, but this is not a problem with so many other establishments nearby. As well as the Damrak, behind the hotel is a fabulous network of shopping streets, with restaraunts ranging from the usual McDonalds and Burger King to chinese, indonesian and dutch cafes and restaurants.The hotel itself is quite modern, with a welcoming reception desk, a small lobby and elevators that service all floors. We elected to stay in a Junior Suite on the 5th floor. We were originally going to book both the flights and hotel through Expedia, but found it was actually cheaper to book the hotel only through this site, and get cheaper flights through Easyjet (as we were flying from Britain). Indeed, for the same price Expedia quoted for a Superior Room plus flights, we found we could actually upgrade to a Junior Suite when we bought the flights separately!What attracted us to the Junior Suite was not only the larger room size and good location at the front of the building, but also that it was the only type of room that guaranteed a king size bed. It was my first holiday with my boyfriend, and so we decided we should definitely go with the Suite! The bed is huge - it could easily fit four people across. There is also a sofa with a large television, as well as a large desk and chair, spacious wardrobe and in room safe. One side of the room was made up of large floor-to-ceiling windows, which opened up and provided a fantastic view of the streets below. However, the highlight of the room was the huge bathroom that was separated from the rest of the room by glass doors. (Luckily, the toilet was behind a shaded door to maintain privacy!) There was also a bath, sink, and massive shower. Very nice.On the final day of our stay, we decided to order breakfast. We had gone for the cheap option of buying breakfast from McDonalds and various bakeries on previous mornings, but thought we would splash out on our final morning. At 20 Euros each, it's not cheap. The food provided was adequate, but I'm not sure it is worth 20 Euros. You get to choose from quite an extensive list, however not everything we selected was delivered to us. We ended up with coffee, two cups of juice, two bowls of cereal, two bowls of fresh fruit, one serve of bacon and one serve of eggs (in the hot food section on the menu, you can only choose one item each, which makes it a bit difficult to construct a fry up!) Like I say, it was adequate, but I would urge visitors to fill up at nearby eateries instead.Also, while staying in our room, the hotel provided bathrobes, which are free of charge for the duration of your stay. However, I was a little surprised when I could only find one bathrobe! And, upon ringing the front desk, I was told this was the standard! Upon my request, the desk kindly sent up a second bathrobe, so no complaints. Although I did find it strange that the standard practice is only one bathrobe is provided per room. The hotel also provided one bottle of water free of charge, rather than two, and when they turned down the beds, they only did one side. Not a real grumble, but it was a little confusing when there was clearly a couple sharing the room!The hotel is 4 stars and it does deserve that rating. It is clean, modern and efficient. European hotel standards are different to those elsewhere in the world, and 4 stars may give some visitors the impression it is going to be something more than it is. However, you just have to go with the flow, enjoy what you are provided with, and, most importantly, don't linger in your hotel room - get out there and enjoy all that this wonderful city has to offer! :-)

We stayed in one of the newly renovated superior rooms and we were very impressed. We have stayed at many hotels but the Swiss么tel is surely one of the best we've seen. We've read some negative reviews on this site but we feel that they are really not deserved.

<Content>not worth 4*s great location. lovely lobby. nice staff. then to the room. It was just a standard room but in a 4* hotel it should have been better. The decor was stark. The carpet was very stained with goodness know what. the pillows were like bricks. I had to remake the bed the bedding was all crumpled. At least you had some english tv channels. Breakfast was not included, but at the price even a continental would have been nice. There is a very nice take away sandwich shop near by. I was dissapointed.

<Content>Comfortable, but the rooms are small We stayed at the Swissotel Amsterdam in June 2004 and were disappointed when we first saw our hotel room. Well, it's not that the room was that bad, but for a reputable 4*+ international property, we had expected better than what we got. The room furnishings looked outdated, although the small lobby looked modern and newly renovated. We were surprised to find that the hotel room was rather small -- the small elevator and narrow corridor to the rooms were hints that the rooms weren't going to be spacious either...almost had a clastophobic feeling. The bathroom door had to be closed all the time or it would block the passage to the main door. On a brighter note, the room was clean and decent. The staff were friendly. The hotel is also conveniently located near the Dam Square and within walking distance to the train station. By the 3rd day of our stay, we'd readjusted our hotel expectations and focused instead on enjoying our tour of The Netherlands.

<Content>French for 'Howard Johnson's' The Swiss么tel on Dam Square is the classic model for don't judge a hotel by its lobby. The rooms are depressing and worn, which is maybe why the lighting is so frustratingly dim. Really, for a place that touts itself as a 4* property, a little post-eighties renovation is in order. Now, if only they could get the Burger King outside your window to turn off its blinding lights...

<Content>Solid 4-Star Hotel My wife and I spent 4 days here in early September. We had one of the Superior rooms on the 5th floor. Room overlooked the inner courtyard and was quiet even with the window open. During our stay, the outside construction was mostly finished, no scaffolding up just using a bucket truck for some brickwork. Front desk was efficient on checkin and checkout and provided good recommendations for restaurants etc. Didn't use the hotel breakfast, too many other cheaper alternatives nearby. If you don't mind the area, Dam Square/Damrak, Swissotel is an excellent choice.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel---THE place to stay in A'dam I travel to Amsterdam frequently and would not consider staying anywhere other than the Swiss么tel. This is one of the nicest hotels out there. The location in Amsterdam could not be better, here at the Dam you are right in the middle of everything you could possibly want in a visit to Amsterdam. Everything is within easy walking distance or a short tram ride away. The junior suites are spacious and refined, with great views of the Dam Square and the National Monument---the 5th floor in particular has wonderful high ceilings with exposed beams. The inlaid wood floors in the rooms, the marble-topped mini bar, the leather chairs, the giant wardrobe, the artwork---everything about this place exudes elegance. The spacious bathroom with separate shower and soaking tub, marble floors  countertops, fresh flowers, and complimentary bathrobe and slippers is beyond compare. As I said, I am a regular traveller to A'dam and after staying here I will never stay anywhere else. The breakfast, although not included in the room price, is more than worth the extra 20 euros. Also, all the staff members were friendly and helpful...including one HOT bellboy who I've got some stories about that aren't appropriate for sharing here!!! As to those reviewers whining about the renovations...I was there again in August, and yes there was some scaffolding, but I was NEVER awakened by the workmen or their noise. All hotels undergo some renovations at one time or another; this is not the first hotel I've ever stayed in while improvements were going on and I bet it won't be the last. The Swiss么tel is a very nice place to stay, and it is my hotel of choice when visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Brilliant I booked this hotel as a surprise for my boyfriends 21st Birthday, after reading some of the reviews on this site I was slightly worried about our stay. I emailed the hotel and commented about the building work going on and that we were coming for a special weekend -not only did the hotel book us a room as far away from the scaffolding as possible (can I mention that we did not see one builder while we were there) they also gave us a free upgrade. Throughout our stay all of the staff at the Swissotel were extremley helpful and polite.We stayed in a Superior room -which was lovely!! The only thing we were slightly disappointed with was that the bed was actually two single beds pushed together - however they were very comfy. We also had a TV, Desk, Chairs, Mini Bar, Safe in our room. The bathroom was a good size with a seperate shower and bath. This was very clean.Some people on this site have mentioned the noise of trams etc. We stayed in room 431 (with a view of Burger King and McDonalds-haha) and we had no problem with noise at all! So it maybe best to request a room towards the back of the hotel.The hotel is in an excellent location, about a 10minute walk from Central Station (central station is about 15mins from Schipol airport,will cost you about 鈧?.20) and right next door to Dam Square -what more can you ask for??

<Content>Excellent quality hotel I was understandably nervous when I booked this hotel, then read some of the reviews here, so much so I emailed the hotel with copies of the reviews and asked them to comment. I was assured that they were not an accurate reflection. I decided to trust the assurances and I am so glad I did. The hotel is very clean with excellent rooms and the staff were all polite and very friendly. Yes there was scaffolding outside (being taken down) but this did not affect our stay. Yes the restaurant was closed on an evening, but with an excellent one next door, and another 50 eating places within 100 yards to suit every taste again we did not find this a problem. Would I stay again or recommend it? Yes, without question.

<Content>Great room shame about the builders I booked a junior suite at the Swissotel for our wedding anniversary having read good reviews on line, including one which said the rooms were sound proofed. When we arrived I was surprised to see the scaffolding as no mention was made of any building work. The room was amazing, and was possibly an executive suite having looked at the photos in the hotel lift. We had a large living room with a dining table, sofa, chairs and tv as well as Espresso machine. The bedroom (behind sliding doors) and bathroom were together the same size as the living room. The bed was massive and very comfortable, and the bedroom had it's own tv. The bath was a spa bath and the separate shower excellent. A complementary toblerone topped off our delight as we settled in. In the evening there was some minor traffic noise and the odd tram could be heard. The view was obstructed by the scaffolding but wasn't what we'd booked the room for so we were not concerned. Unfortunately we were woken at 07.15 to the sound of builders. There was an initial roll call and then hammering for over half an hour. Not really what we'd hoped for on a romantic break. When we checked out I raised this with the staff who apologised stating that the builders were not supposed to start before 09.00. I accepted the apology as it seemed genuine and the rest of our stay had been so good, however reading these reviews it would seem that the 07.15 builders wake up call is a regular occurance. I'll be taking it up with the hotel.Once the building work is complete I would recommend the hotel as it was one of the best I've stayed in.

<Content>Wonderful room  We stayed at the Swissotel for 3 nights. Our initial reaction to the outside of the building was disappointment because there was scaffolding, but the quality of the room and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff more than compensated for a compromised view of the Dam Square, which frankly isn't the most beautiful thing to look at when you wake up anyway.The first room to which we were assigned had ineffective air conditioning, and the staff then reassigned us to another and better room. The room was very comfortable and a joy to comehome to at the end of each day. Also, each member of the desk staff thatwe interacted with was courteous, pleasant and extremely helpful. They always had good and helpful answers to questions about restaurants,transportation, the local cinema, museums and anything else. Thanks to the staff's suggestions, we avoided waiting in line at the Van Gogh museum, we saved money on our rides on the tram, and we ate at good restaurants. I noted while there that there were no workers on the scaffolding. Had there been, I can imagine that their presence would have been a problem if they had started working early in the morning. I think this is a very good hotel that becomes an excellent one once the exterior work is done and the scaffolding comes down. I don't know when that will be.

<Content>Disgusted We just returned from a 2-night stay at the Swissotel. We were extremely disappointed with this hotel, after reading great reviews on this site and elsewhere. Our room, requested as non-smoking, smelled very smoky, and it was also very dirty--dirty carpet, dirty bathroom, etc. Scaffolding and plastic was our 'view' outside our window. Our bathtub did not drain properly and spewed sewage when we ran the faucet. After complaining to the condescending manager, our rate was reduced by 10 E a night. We were not at all happy with this hotel or its treatment of us. Also, it was very noisy at night, with noise coming from the carnival at the Dam square, and the tram which runs right outside the hotel, as well as from the generally very busy street outside.Pro: It is an easy walk from the train station and convenient to restaurants, shopping, sights, etc. That is the only reason I give this hotel two stars.

<Content>Utterly disappointed with the Swissotel in Damrak Given the group's reputation and the rates, you can imagine our disappointment when my fiance  I turned up for a w/e break at the hotel to find the exterior of the hotel covered in scaffolding. Despite exchanging several mails with the reservations desk at the hotel, there was no mention of the fact that there would be builders present during our stay when we booked the room. We had specifically requested a superior room with a king size bed, so I was rather peeved to find that not only did our room have the picturesque view of a brick wall but that our king size bed was in fact two single mattresses pushed together. Upon mentioning this to the hotel staff, we were upgraded to a junior suite, although not before I was quizzed by a second member of staff as to why I wanted to move rooms in the first place. Her tone was offensive to say the least. Imagine our delight when at 7.15 the next morning, I found a couple of builders outside our window hammering away for Queen and country. The manager said he completely understood my feelings when I raised all these points with him but his contrition lasted all of two minutes. He offered to reduce the room rates by the pricely sum of 鈧?0 per night. There were no apologies and he certainly didn't appear to regret the fact that between his badly-trained staff and the builders, they'd managed to ruin our weekend. The restaurant bar proudly boasted on its website that it stayed open till midnight. When we turned up, it shut its' doors at 7.30 p.m for Summer Closing. Call me cynical, but surely the summer opening hours should be longer, not shorter than winter hours. Overall, the Swissotel in Damrak was of a very poor standard and it clearly does not derserve its four stars.

<Content>Average... I booked the hotel for a weekend's stay. It's very near to Centraal Station, which is great if coming from the airport. The Hotel itself is right near Dam Square, and 5 minutes from the Red Light District - so you're near the action!I had booked a Superior room and was given a single superior. The room was spacious, but the bed was a small double - no real issue there but I expected a standard hotel double (Queen) - there is a difference. The people next door were quite noisy, so I asked if I could be moved, and reception moved me to a superior double - good staff. The room (superior) - big, spacious room. Clean and furnished to general 4-star hotel standards. A large desk for business travellers with an excellent leather desk chair. An expresso coffee machine was a pleasant surprise. A clean and excellent (with above average pressure) shower. The bed was disappointing. Looking like a kingsize, it's actually two doubles thrown together - careful you don't fall through the gap! My room, as with most of the rooms had no view. And expect to hear noises from most of the rooms - unless you specifically ask for a quiet one!The Hotel doesn't have a lobby as such - just a reception area and a sofa round the side. The restauraunt is small but there's no excuse to be eating there, when there's a whole city to explore. Breakfast menu is restricted and expensive.In summary - the superior room is of good size but the two beds thrown together was disappointing. Having no view was also disappointing but as a tourist, one shouldn't be spending too much time inside. The staff seemed friendly and overall, whilst I wouldn't stay there again, I didn't wholly like or dislike my stay. Average is the only conclusion to give...

<Content>2 star hotel at 4 star prices The only thing nice is the Staff and the entry way which makes you think 4 star hotel...but when you get to room, you find no view, noise on street below, stained carpet, and twin beds pushed together...overall, you are better off at a nice BB a few blocks away from the busy center

<Content>Disappointed We were disappointed with the Swissotel in Amsterdam. We had reserved a smoking room with a king bed but were told they had only no smoking rooms available upon check in. They offered a smoking room with two twin beds but I refused and demanded a complete refund. Seems to me when a four star hotel takes your money in advance to hold a reservation - they ought to have a room you agreed to. Finally they decided to let us smoke in a non smoking room with a king bed as long as we keep the window open. To top it all off the room had NO view. The window literally opened directly to a large bank of airconditioning and heating equipment despite advertisements boasting all rooms had a view of either Dam Square or a side shopping street. All in all very disappointing. Next trip I will try the Krasnapolsky across the street.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed 7 nights beginning April 29, 2004. The Amsterdam Swissoltel certainly lived up to all the recommendations we read about in the reviews.We had booked a standard room and was upgraded to a superior room because we arrived at noon and the standard room was not ready. The staff were very helpful and the room was immaculate. We were there for Queens Day and our room was at the back of the hotel and was quiet. The location was excellent. Would certainly stay there again.

<Content>junior suit We stayed 3 nights here, originally meant to be staying in the superior double but then decided to go for the junior suit as it was only 40 euro extra a night. Lovely hotel, overlooking Dam Square. Shops, cafes and bars located outside hotel. Red light district 5-10 minute walk away. Small amount of noise can be heard from outside whilst in your hotel room but nothing to disturb you at night. Overall a very pleasent hotel in the heart of Amsterdam. I will definetely stay here again.

<Content>Good Hotel Booked this Hotel for us and some friends, for our first visit to Amsterdam, after looking at consumer reviews on this web site.Our room was not as large as I envisaged but was very clean and very comfortable. Fully equipped. Bathroom was very nice although we did struggle to get the shower set up so we didn't flood the bathroom!!On arrival, at check in staff heard mention that it was one of our freinds birthdays. A bottle of wine was sent to their room with the Hotels compliments. A very nice touch.Location of the Swissotel is superb. A gentle walk from Central Station and right on Dam Square so everywhere was easy to get to. Good security with key card required to access lifts and stairs to bedrooms.Would definitely book here again if returning to Amsterdam.

<Content>Not bad, but . . . . We went to Amsterdam for the weekend and booked at the last minute. We had some difficulty finding a room where I'd stayed before (near Vondel Park), but found a spring special on the Swissotel - 270 euros/night for a standard room. It was very standard - two twin beds with the risky gap. Room 228 - staring at the brick wall. Carpet had lots of stains - due for a refresh. We didn't have any espresso machine, but the room did come with an electric kettle and Nescafe. Decent pillows, good water pressure, relatively quiet. Not bad, but not worth north of $300 after taxes and fees.

<Content>Amazing location, nice rooms You are right off the Dam at this hotel. All the major tram lines are right out the front door, and it's an easy hop to get to the train station. Lovely service. I liked the hotel restaurant - not your usual fare. Quick tram ride to the Van Gogh museum  Rijksmuseum. Oh - while you are that museums, at one end of the park there is a really nice subterranean grocery store. Stock up on snacks and pop as the mini bar is a rip off (as they are at all hotels). There is a mini-mart a couple doors down from the hotel, but it's more expensive and there's less selection.

<Content>Quiet, Central, Relaxing The hotel is clean and tidy, with Smoking and Non-Smoking floors.The standard rooms are pretty .... standard. Not much room beyond the bed and closets, and the bathroom is the same. The espresso machine was a nice addition to the room.The bed was a little ropey too - it was a large bed made out of two matresses, with a clear diving gouge down the middle - a little soft for my liking too - and the pillows are an odd shape, square.The Hotels location is fantastic, very central. There is a supermarket about 1 min away (out of the hotel and left) and a Mc Donalds next door. There are alot of resurants in the area too (at least 140 within a 1 mile radius from the hotel).Don't get a cab from the airport it's not particularly accesible from the road and has no parking. Get a train from central Station and it's about a 10 Minute walk.

<Content>Great place to stay! In the center of all attractions! i really enjoyed my stay at the swissotel amsterdam. it is a very nice hotel with great service and friendly staff. Rooms-the rooms very nice and modernly designed. the bed was huge and very comfortable, and when we requested a rollaway bed, the staff gladly complied. the room has a variety of tourist magazines that are very helpful. we stayed in a junior suite and it was spacious and had good wood floors. one problem was that, late at night you can hear a lot of traffic through the window that might keep you up at night. Bathrooms-the set up of the bathrooms are quite odd. there is no privacy, but merely a glass door that leads from the room. this is quite inconvenient if you want privacy while bathing or showering. luckily, there is a separate door for the bathroom. there is a huge shower and a separate sunken bath, both very nice. there are adequate supplies such as nail filers and special vanity sets for your beauty needs. it is a large bathroom. Staff and Service-staff are very kind and will help you with directions or whatever you may need. Service is very good, and every morning you get a free nice buffet breakfast at their posh restaurant. For lunch and dinner although, their menus are quite unvarietized, i would suggest dining out. Cleanliness-this hotel is very clean!!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!!

<Content>Great Location! Stayed in a superior double for 6 nights - booked through expedia.ca. Clean, quiet (and we were facing Dam Square) and good size rooms. Excellent location (Dam Square): Close to many restaurants, pubs, red light district and pedestrian malls (Amsterdam is easy to walk and you can easily get ot other popular squares within 10-20 minutes). I would stay here again.

My husband and I were upgraded after a week of business travel to a suite and we were put in an executive suite. And they delivered us wine when my husband arrived. It's a great location and felt extremely safe in the hotel. The breakfast is pricey but adequate. You can't go wrong with this hotel. I would love to return but couldn't stay anywhere else because I'm already spoiled.

<Content>Ask for Room 409! Stayed at the Swissotel from Feb 22nd -24th 2004. Fantastic location but the room we were allocated had a view of a brick wall!! Not being too happy with that we asked if we could change rooms and were told that only Junior Suites were available at an extra 40 euros per night. I have to be honest and say that I was rather peeved at this, having seen the reviews on here regarding free upgrades etc, but it was worth every last euro! We had a wonderful room ( Room 409 ), overlooking Dam Sq, it had the most amazing glass walled bathroom, huge bed, lovely pillows, free tea and coffee, huge fluffy bath-towels, bathrobes, free slippers, tv and VCR, mini bar, excellent hairdryer, trouser press, iron and ironing board.Wouldn't go as far as to say it should be 5 star, but it is definitely at the top end of the 4 star range!Well worth a visit if you are going to A'dam, though if you are on a budget, it may not be the place to go!

<Content>Superb 4 to 5 Star Quality Hotel - Excellent Staff+Rooms! Swissotel is a fine hotel of true quality A-Z! Visiting one of our favourite, beautiful cities, Amsterdam, is always special to experience because of its people and rich culture in the arts but this time our 3 day stay at the Swissotel was icing on the cake for us. This hotel lives up to its 4 star status and we believe it could easily merit a 5 star. Location is in the heart of historic Dam Square but because the rooms are so quiet and peaceful you would think you're in the countryside at night. We were on the 5th floor, staying in the superior deluxe room and the picturesque view of the canal houses' rooftops including that of the church steeple and the palace was breathtaking straight from our window-what a great way to admire the historical Dutch architecture before your eyes close up. The hotel staff was very pleasant  attentive from the moment we checked in and the rooms are immaculate. We sincerely thank the manager, Mark, for extending his professional yet personal touch with his signed lovely card to wish us a happy anniversary  we thank him for his lovely surprise in assigning an upgraded room for us upon our arrival. The beds are 6ft and very comfortable and the pillows were dreamy! The bathrobes are white and warm and what a spacious bathtub - you can almost float in it-also shower is superb quality! It was a thrill to use the Lavazza expresso machine and tea as well inside our tastefully designed room. We will most definitely stay at the Swissotel again and highly recommend it. If you value comfort, cleanliness, a centralised scenic hotel location  excellent hotel staff service - Swissotel is THE hotel for you!

<Content>Only One Problem with Swissotel ! We stayed at this Hotel and found One major Problem with this Hotel! WE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE !!! Room and service was Superb ! Staff were Friendly and made our visit feel like a return of a valued client rather than a 1st time visiter! Room was clean and well stocked with Tea/coffee and when we requested more they were in the room within 10 minutes! Bathroom was spotless and the toiletries were excellent, the shower was great after walking round amsterdam !! And the Pillows were the best we have found in any hotel we have stayed in ! We have stayed in many hotels in amsterdam over the years from B  B to 5* Luxury but the Swissotel will be our No1 choice Now! One Tip: Dont use an agency or web travel site to book , go direct to Swissotel web site for the best Rates , we paid 85 Euros for our room ! cheapest quote on web agency was 155! One other thing to be aware of in Amsterdam.....Taxis are exhorbitantly expensive! Use the Trams !

<Content>Great location!Very good rooms. We stayed here in January 2004 in an executive suite. Very cool. 9 Windows in the room that wrap around the building. Spacious and confortable. Espresso machine in the room a plus. Super location right next to dam square. Very good service in the hotel. It's meant for business people, but tourists will be most satisfied. It's not super fancy, but is well kept, clean, and does the job. I'd return but only for an executive suite. Pay a little more and get this one. It is worth it.

<Content>Executive Suite!!!! We stayed at the Swissotel in Jan. 2003 and were fortunate to be upgraded to the executive suite for no reason. We were instantly spoiled! We then went back to AMS in March w/ friends and they talked us into staying at another hotel across the Dam Square. Nice hotel but we kept wishing we were at the Swissotel executive suite. Now we are heading back, this time we wanted nothing less then the Executive Suite. It's pricey but well worth it for a relaxing pampered experience. The room is HUGE! Windows begin from the entrance wrapping around the room and ending where the bedroom wall ends. It gives the room a feeling of openness. There is an in-room espresso machine, refrigerator, etc. Whirlpool tub w/ separate glass enclosed shower. A couple tips on the whirlpool, wait until the tub is completely full before turning on the jets other wise water splatters every where. Also it's not meant for 'shampoo trying to be bubble bath' especially when you use the whole little bottle that they give you and then turn on the jets. You get bubbles the height of Mt. Rushmore. :) Light wood is used through out w/ glass partitions. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The computer room down stairs was great for the Internet (free), etc. We ended up having breakfast delivered via room service most days. The food was served hot and fresh and in a timely manner. You pay for this morning convenience but worth it when you are lounging around in your robe and slippers in your executive suite. I cannot say enough about the Swissotels executive suite. We were upgraded by a fluke the first time we were there and now we are willing to pay to make sure we have the same experience. We can get a normal room someplace else but if you want pampered elegance pick the Swissotel executive suite.

<Content>Would go back to Swissotel We booked the Swissotel after reading the reviews on this web-site. Although a little expensive, it is well worth the money. We were very fortunate to be upgraded to a Junior Suite and the room and bathroom were lovely. A minor problem was rectified immediately and nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff. The location is pefect and although our room overlooked the main square, we didn't find it noisy thanks to very good double-glazed windows. We would go back there anytime!
