<Content>It's not that bad! Like many others, I had mixed feelings about booking this hotel for the 3 nights we'd be in Barcelona. My party of 12 however, had no regrets whatsoever.We had good rates from the hotel, and the hotel is conveniently located next to the Poble Sec Subway Station, which makes moving around extremely easy. It is also a 10 minute walk away from the Font Magica which is an impressive attraction indeed.The hotel staff were very friendly, and even offered to reserve the restaurants for us, and should the restaurant not be available, they recommended other restaurants which were fantastic indeed. There isn't free wireless internet, but free wired internet instead.The only big problem we had with the hotel was the stench that came from the sewage pipes in certain rooms. It was heavy and got worse in the morning than in the day. Thankfully the windows could be opened and we could ventilate the room whilst we were in it.This is a small hotel, but I believe for the price of this hotel, the amenities provided and the location couldn't be better. Recommended to those who only need an accommodation to spend the night and not to use the facilities within the hotel!

<Content>dont stay here do not stay in this hotel. I nearly got killed when the lift door closed on me. I reported it to the manager and he didnt want to know at all about it. He said the lifts are broke and they dont work poperly, but they were still in use. The sheets on the bed were never changed the 4 nights we were there. There was cockroaches in the batroom and a constant smell . It was a shocking hotel to stay in. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!

<Content>Good value, adequate hotel We stayed at this hotel for a one night pre-cruise. Room size was large and bed comfortable. Free wifi did not require a password just worked. Room was hot due to inefficient air conditioning which disengages when you leave the room (need to put room key in slot on wall). Windows did open but small terrace was littered with many cigarette butts. It was quite a long walk from the airporter bus stop. Stay was adequate but not remarkable. Safe in room was left locked so needed to have technician come and open. It was handled quickly.

<Content>Nice hotel in good location After reading some of the reviews of the hotel, I was a bit worried about the hotel after already booking it through Expedia. But it was a really nice hotel in a great location. We only stayed at the Silken Concordia for the night, as we were about to take a cruise the next day out of Barcelona. The hotel is located right across the street from a Metro stop, three stops away from Drassanes where we were to get off for the port area so it was ideal for us. The only problem we found with carting our luggage was more with the Metro system (lots of steps and no escalators or elevators), but that was found to be the case all over the city. Only one minor problem with the hotel which wasn't a big deal was that we were traveling in a family with separate rooms. They put us on different floors and when we asked if we could be put together, they acted as though they didn't want to be bothered. There is free Wifi in the rooms, just need to ask for access at the front desk. They will then give you an access code. Rooms were rather spacious for Europe and well decorated. Good place to stay for a night or two while in Barcelona and for a good price. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>okay, but nothing to really rave about went on a trip across three major spanish cities and this was the hotel choice for barcelona. this cost more than the other hotels we stayed in, was of less star rating and was for a shorter period of time. i know its peak season, but deffinatly not worth the 160 odd pound it was for 2 nights when there is probably a lot more around for the same price.really, really good location (hence choice) good metro links. only one line runs to the tube station by the hotel, but it contains all the major tourist stops at any rate.room is okay. nicely decorated. we had a double. of adequate size, but not the biggest i have seen. probably becasue the bed wasn't a double more of a king, which was nice.bathroom looks nice, but i wasn't overally happy with it. the shower curtain doesn't keep all the water in the tub. the toilet has a problem with it. when flushed it just kept filling until you went back to press the flush again shortly and sharply. the first time we realised this, the sisten in the toilet had been filling for 2 hours! the toiletry freebies are yucky at this hotel, haha. so if you usually rely on hotel provisions, i wouldn't at this one!didn't eat in the resturant as wasn't much choice for vegetarians.overall, an okay stay. clean n tidy. wouldn't stay there for the same cost again though.

<Content>No air condition and rooms are boiling!!! the hotel it self was a normal Spanish hotel with normal facilities but to our big surprice the hotel informed that they don't have air condition even if they advertise it online. the whole hotel was set to one temperature with no possibility to adjust your room temperature which was about 40 c hot. it was impossible to sleep, work, or do anything else in the room without having the windows open all the time and even then it was boiling hot. having the window open at night made it impossible to sleep because of the constant street noise that doesn't stop in Barcelona. at least for us who came to Barcelona to work at a trade fair it was a big deal since we all went to work and important meetings completely tired after no sleep. we asked many times from reception but were told that the hotel doesn't have air con.....this cant be true. it is just simply too expensive to turn it on i assume? if this is the case the customers should be informed about this in advance....cannot recommend to anyone.

<Content>Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights with my boyfriend. I must say after reading some of the reviews i was a little worried as i had booked it as a xmas present. I was pleasantly suprised at how clean the reception was, also the room we stayed in and the hallways. Not an inch of dust in sight. Our room was tidied everyday, we had clean towels as often as we needed them and there was enough toiletries supplied on the first day to see us right through to the last day. The only thing did not work properly was the air conditioning, but that was easily solved with having the window open. Yes it was quite noisey outside but if you did the amout of walking and sightseeing that we managed to do, then like me you would fall asleep as soon as your head touched the pillow!We didn't eat in the hotel at all but that was purely through choice because we couldn't be bothered getting out of bed for it and we were out till late at night. We really enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Don't stay in room 701!!! My advice would be not to stay here i will never be going back! I had to stay here for a week and had the worst experience ever!After staying a this hotel for one week i came back with hundreds of bed bug bites. My collegues stayed in different rooms and they didn't have a problem so i'm not saying that this is an all over problem.My advice is if your staying in room 701 please becareful- check the headboard with a torch and check the mattress for tell tale signs. I informed the hotel of this matter upon my return to England requesting that they close this room to the public and seek proffesional guidence. Eventually they replied to me however i as yet have recieved any further response. Personally i will never stay at this hotel again!

<Content>Great hotel for walkers Stayed four nights, Monday to Friday, hotel was clean and quiet, staff very helpful and always with a smile. Hotel situated within walking distance to most of the attractions ( all four of us in our sixties and had no trouble walking) 20 minutes to the Ramblas or the port and 10 minutes to the Metro where you can get on the cable car to the castle ( great views of the city from there). Food at the hotel was a suprise the daily menu is eight courses including wine and bottled water for 17 euros. There are many eating places around the hotel, try the basilico restaurant across the road from the hotel but you may need to book

<Content>BREAKFASTS TO DIE FOR More than we had expected at a very reasonable price.Service excellent, rooms of a good size and standard. Everything very clean. Breakfast at 11 euros per day was excellent everything you could wish for. OK its a little off the main area but that is reflected in the price. We have paid up to 3 times for a hotel in Ramblas and Gothic areas which were inferior. Metro and buses just outside hotel and taxis only 5 euros into central area. We are in our sixties and walked several times into central town. If I want to be picky, it was a little noisy but after some good wine and a few cognacs sleep was no problem.

The room was very clean, had a mini fridge, tv (with English channels which is rare for budget hotels in Europe!), and a pretty big bathroom. The staff was friendly and had internet for 1.75 in the lobby. The location is a bit far from the main sites but is definitely within walking distance.

<Content>Excellent hotel This hotel is great value for money and definitely worth its three stars. Nice room, very clean, friendly and helpful staff. We had no problems with the air conditioning and even when we'd been out all day the room wasn't too hot anyway (temperatures outside were high 20s - low 30s). Location is also excellent - not bang in the centre but you could walk to Las Ramblas in about 15 minutes and the tube station is literally across the road so you can get to most major attractions in minutes. Considering what we paid I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived and would definitely stay here again

<Content>Great location, excellent service Silken Concordia perhaps isn鈥檛 a luxury accommodation, but definitely worth the three stars and absolutely great value for money. We stayed there for one week in July 2007 (24.-31.7.) with my better half and I have to say that we both loved it. Because there seems to have been some nags about the air conditioning I start by mentioning that it worked like a charm in our room. If anything, it felt almost too effective at times. And the temperature outside was in the 30-degrees-centigrade region the whole week.The service was delightful. We arrived there at 11am and they gave us our room straight away (we hadn鈥檛 requested an early check-in in advance). During the week the staff was very helpful with all our requests and questions. They also communicated quite fluently in English, so there was no language barrier either.Location was also near perfect (for us anyway): Walking distance from Plaza Catalunya, Rambla, Old town, Montju茂c, Font Magica, Port Vell etc. And a subway station right across the road to get you to those attractions further away. The neighborhood isn鈥檛 exactly something you鈥檇 call picturesque. I liked staying there though, because wandering in the streets nearby revealed a little bit of the unpolished, 鈥渢rue鈥?Barcelona that you won鈥檛 find in the tourist-heavy areas. Although a tad rough round the edges, it wasn鈥檛 by any means an intimidating area to walk around even in the dark. And the hotel itself was newish, well-groomed and clean. We didn鈥檛 have the breakfast included in our room (luckily, I may add) but gave it one shot. It was in my opinion quite unimaginative and not worth the 12鈧?person/day. Ok, it got you full, but for that amount of money you will find much better eateries round the town.This review got a bit long and may sound like an advertisement, but we really didn鈥檛 find anything negative worth mentioning about the hotel. I would recommend it to anyone!

The room was nice, not too much noise considering you're in a city, temperature was ok and the aircon worked fine in our room. The size of the room was ok, about the same as a travel lodge room. We didnt have breakfast included in our stay but found plenty of places to eat around Gracia station. We used the tube loads (which is directly opp the hotel) and would recommend the 10 trips card which is approx 6 Euro.

<Content>Smooth like ... silken! The reviews I read didn't prepare me for this hotel. All my requests at the time of the reservations were satisfied: non-smokers, double bed...The room is big, the bed huge ( 3 persons could sleep there nicely), the small attentions in the bathroom - replaced every day - were fantastic: champoo, shower gel, comb, dental kit, shaving kit, tissues, nail kit, etc, etc.The room style was very modern, even the glasses for the minibar were stylish.The only minor problem were morning sounds, the maids cleaning (vacuming) the other rooms.The location is wonderful, very central, near all you want to visit in Barcelona.The staff, in general, is helpfull, but not so friendly (maybe a city behavior). The only exception was a very unfriendly breafast staff member. So unpleasant, to everyone. Maybe she's misplaced in such a nice place, with excelent accomodations, location, price and quality.

When coming out of airport you can catch the train to Catalunya (4 stops) then transfer to the metro line and travel to poble sac which takes you right outside the hotel. very easy to travel this way. bit like london underground but cleaner and easier to follow. should take you 20 minutes from airport to silken concordia. staff very helpful and breakfast good quality.

<Content>Good Value Budget Hotel We stayed in this hotel during the Barcelona Festival at the end of September 06 and found it to be great value for money. It is clean, modern, and right across the road from Poble Sec tube station.Contrary to other reviews I found the staff very helpful, I booked directly with the hotel and forgot to request a smoking room and when we arrived there was none available, however, the receptionist did manage to get us one and we changed on the 3rd night which I thought was good service. The second room was on the turn of the corridor and was therefore quite a bit smaller than the first room but it was still adequate. Don`t remember having a problem with the room temp even though it was still quite hot outside when we were there. I think this is a good choice for the money. Restaurants up the street (turn left out of hotel) very good value and friendly.

<Content>Nice albeit overheated room Spent four nights at the Silken Concordia with my fiancee in early Feb 07 at 鈧?0 including tax for a double room. Our first impression was very good as it麓s a step up in polish from small family-run hostals around Spain, but our opinion suffered a bit by the time we left. We got a very clean and spacious room with two twin beds (this seems pretty standard around Spain). Bathroom was roomy and very nice with a good shower. There is a mini-bar/fridge and desk.We loved the location. Just far enough away from La Rambla, etc. that you pay reasonable prices for meals and eat amongst locals, just close enough to walk where you want to go. Poble Sec metro (Line 3) is directly across the street which links you in three stops one way to Sants train station (also airport train connection) and 2-4 stops the other way to the center of the old city. The Barcelona metro is cheap and easy to use. We found a rough and ready 1鈧?min internet cafe 5 mins walk away, and two great restaurants across the street. Facing the Agip station, there is a creperie and an Italianish place on the block to the left. Both had very friendly staff and great, cheap food.On the downside, the staff is pretty indifferent and only recommended restaurants from the Lonely Planet guide. Not much use for local color. The room was REALLY hot, consistently 27-29C. Like other reviewers, I discovered that turning on the A/C only made it hotter, and asking the front desk only made me more frustrated. The window opened a few inches and that had to be good enough. On the Friday night of our stay, the fire alarm went off around 1am due to too many smokers in one of the 1st floor meeting rooms. The fire department didn麓t come, and the staff weren麓t overly concerned about doing anything or explaining what to do. That is, no one was in charge. If you felt like evacuating, fine. If you felt like taking your chances in your room, go for it.In summary, it麓s comfy and clean but a bit generic with apathetic staff. If I麓m back in Barcelona, I麓d look for a different hotel and consider this a backup.

<Content>Great stay, but not as nice as the photos After shopping around for hotels, i think we found a real bargain with this hotel. it was modern, rigth across the street from the poble sec metro stop, and a quick walk to the central tourist area. while not effusively nice (like the rest of barcelonians we met), the staff were helpful and professional. our main observation was that the hotel was nice but could have been maintained a little better. the hotel is only a few years old, but already you could see that wear and tear on the furnishings. it is still has a nice design sense--modern with clean lines--but it's begining to be rough around the edges (our toilet wasn't propely sealed to the floor, the floor wasn't well vaccuumed, the two champagne flutes didn't match and the accompanying glass plate was broken, etc.).the rooms can be terribly hot in the winter as there is no fan and only an open window will allow you any sort of cool air, since the main heating presumably dominates the rooms even if you turn off your room's heating. overall, it was a nice hotel and we enjoyed out stay. we found an excellent deal online and this hotel was the best in our price range!**watch out for the tapas bars across the street. we encountered extremely rude service and were bellowed at by the server.

<Content>Great Hotel, Had a Awesome Time Stayed here on a trip to Madrid/Barcelona in November. Only have good things to say about this place. Rooms were spacious and modern, we had the double room which is the largest. Paid ~65 Euro/night. The staff were extremely helpful at all hours. The central location is great, about 15-20 min walk to everything (Las Ramblas, the Seafront, Montjuic, etc). There is a shuttle bus (6 Euro) to and from the airport at Plaza Catalunya stop on the metro and from there you can take the green line to Poble Sec right in front of the hotel. Get a T-pass (10 rides) for 6 Euros. Cab is ~25 Euro if you get in late. There are tons of bars/cafes on the Ramblas and in the old town to drink and enjoy the atmosphere. Nightlife and people are great and starts a little later than normal. El Raval is the red light district and is supposed to be a grittier, although there didn't seem to be anything to worry about. Tip: If you shop be sure to ask about the EU tax refund for foreign travelers. Hope that helps for anyone thinking of visiting this amazing city.

<Content>Very nice hotel in a central location I stayed in this hotel recently along with my wife. The rooms are quite spacious, the furniture is modern and it looks like new. The bathroom was sparkling clean and also quite big. The price in the low season was about 85 Euros which, in my opinion, is a definite bargain given the quality of the hotel. The staff is quite friendly and willing to help. There are complimentary newspapers in the lobby primarily in Spanish but there is also one or two English-language papers. The breakfast is not included in the price. It's a bit expensive at 12 Euros per person, so we decided to eat our breakfast at a nice local cafe that was only three blocks away in the direction of the old city. The hotel is right in front of a metro station, the Poble Sec. You can also walk to the city center, La Rambla, and so on, in only 15 minutes.

<Content>Good value, good location, good hotel My wife and I stayed here during an anniversary trip to Barcelona and had a fabulous time. We booked our reservation through the hotel website. The entrance and lobby are nice and modern. The staff spoke English fairly well, but we were given incorrect information about a bus route outside the hotel. Aside from that they were helpful and friendly. We requested one large bed instead of two double beds, and we got what we requested. The bed wasn't particularly comfortable, but it wasn't too bad. Our room was very nice and clean, with a mini-bar, safe, and plenty of closet space. The room was by no means soundproof, but we slept well two of the three nights. The bathroom was nice and clean, with plenty of water pressure in the shower. We had no trouble setting the thermostat. The metro station (Poble Sec) is literally right across the street, as is a filling station for snacks, etc. There are plenty of tapas bars in the area and Placa de Espanya is less than a 10 minute walk away, while Poble Espanyol was probably less than a 20 minute walk away. We were allowed to leave our bags in the secure area for the day we checked out at no cost (we did give a tip, though). I'm so glad we checked the reviews for this hotel because it was a real find.

<Content>Great small hotel Stayed at the Concordia from 10/10/06 to 15/10/06 with boyfriend and we throughly enjoyed it. I booked the hotel directly through their website and had no problems with the reservation. When we got there about 5 in the afternoon we had no problems chacking in and I was allocated the type of room I had asked for i.e. on a high floor with no smoking. The room was small but not cramped and was very comfortable and well equipped, you get a great welcome pack of shower gel, shampoo,shaving set even a toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom. Contrary to some reviews we had no problems with the air con whatsoever and didn't find the rooms at all stuffy. The hotel is really well located within walking distance of most of the main shopping precincts and the subway is just across the road and very easy to use. The breakfast was a good selection of cold meats, fruit, bread, cakes and usual orange juice tea or coffee. The staff were all very friendly and overall the hotel was very clean and tidy. I would definately stay here again if I was in Barcelona.

When we arrived at the hotel at 1O'Clock in the morning, the guy on the desk was very helpful and was even patient about our wanting to change our room from a double to a twin. The room was clean and comfortable with a big bathroom. It also had aircon, a mini bar and good wardrobe space. The TV however only show mostly spanish channels but since we were there to see the city, it didn't matter. Metro stop was across the street and you could reach most of the attractions from it.

<Content>Great service with a smile This was my first trip to BCN and as a lone female traveller I wanted to make sure I had a well-connected and, most importantly, safe hotel to stay at. After hours of searching this site, and getting overwhelmed by the conflicting reviews of some hotels, I decided to settle for the hotel that got a frequent thumbs up. I found the pros and cons style of review the most useful in my research so here goes:Pros:Location - The taxi ride took max 15 mins and cost 23 Euros. But I did this the expensive way, as I was arriving late at night, with a mountain of luggage and wanted to make sure I got there without stress. The hotel is on a main road (Avenida Parallel) and literally opposite the Poble Sec tube station. Most of the time I walked around the city, but the tube is clean safe and efficient. Check the times though because I think it closes at midnight. The other option is the bus which apparently makes frequent airport trips. Even if you prefer to do it all by foot then the hotel is a pleasant 20 min walk from Las Ramblas, cutting through La Raval. Each morning I would take a different route through the streets and pick up breakfast in one of the cafes on the way. La Raval is BCN's redlight district so I would not advise this trip alone in the evenings. The hotel is also very close to Montjuic and Plaza Espana, there's a corner shop over the road and a cashpoint is nextdoor. A block or so down there's a tapas bar. I didn't try the tapas but it looked popular with locals and did great hot baguettes to take away which I did try - often.Service - The staff at the hotel completely blew away my preconceptions of BCN being populated by rude, anti-english/american, money grabbing people. Hey, that's what some reviews might have you believe. All my requests to be put in a room with a view, spacious, non-smoking and on a high floor were met. But what really impressed me was that when I ran into a few problems at the start of the holiday they went out of their way to help. I probably dealt with all of the reception staff at some point, and this was consistent. Also, they were really helpful directing me to banks, places to eat, transport etc. And all with a smile.Food -I didn't opt for the breakfast so I can't really comment. I did have a brief look over the menu which is displayed in the lift and it looked pricey when you can get to a nice cafe nearby. From what I gathered the kitchens close after breakfast but you can still get hot drinks.Rooms -The most important thing for me in a room is cleanliness which I couldn't fault. The bed was massive and very comfortable, and the shower was powerful. The TV gives you the local channels (plus a german music channel) but there are also paying channels. There's a minbar and a safe. The aircon chilled the room very quickly. The wardrobe provided sufficient space for my mountain of luggage and didn't leave my clothes smelling musky like some hotel wardrobes do. The maid service was also very efficient changing towels and sheets daily. I didn't try the room service nor laundry.Cons:Price - I was reluctant to list this as a con as it could just be me holding onto student ways. Once you accept the idea that unless you want to share a bathroom with dreadlocked backpackers in a hostal, you are going to have to pay London prices at any hotel in BCN, this 3 * hotel probably offers a great deal for money. The days fluctuated in price but probably hit 110 euros on average per day. Location -This hotel is best suited for the quieter types. There didn't seem to be any nightlife, although being a main road there are always plenty of people walking around. If it's bars, clubs and drunken screams you're after then look for somewhere in the Old Town. The other issue is parking. A friend of mine tried to park in the narrow street nearby but everywhere seemed reserved for residents. You'd have to check with the hotel if there is a parking policy.Just some concluding points: I would definitely stay at this hotel again. It offers good value and cuts out fussy things you don't really need when visiting an amazing place like BCN. I wouldn't just recommend this for the lone traveller; other resident types were young families, couples old and young and business people. One final tip: get yourself to the market just off Las Ramblas and hunt down the stall that serves food about two rows from the left as you enter and three rows back. You will have to wait your turn to get a seat (and it can be a bit of a fight) but the Chipirones con Huevos Fritos are worth it, I promise, and will set you up nicely for a long day sightseeing. Apparently it's their speciality.Anyways, hope I've been of help.

<Content>Great Stay We just recently got back from our stay here. I must say that it was a great value overall. The metro stop was right across the street, so we just caught that from the airport (I would suggest staying somewhere that has a metro stop nearby so you dont have to walk as much). Everything was pretty much walking distance...and if youre not the stupid tourist (keep your wallet inside your jacket/pants, no hanging purses, etc), you'll be fine. The room was comfortable and the bathroom was large enough and very clean with lots of hot water. The cleaning staff didnt clean our rooms like they do in the States, but it was just fine. The breakfast wasnt that great...just go to the las ramblas area for restaurants around there (dont go to the ones across the street from the hotel, they were horrible). The front desk staff had great maps to give us and were very friendly. If you need internet/phone, theres a place right down the street that has it for very cheap. Las Ramblas/barri gotic/el born were all withink 20 minutes walking. Overall, I would def. stay here again and it was a great bargain! Also, I would recommend coming to Spain during October because the weather was perfect.

<Content>Great Hotel - easy to find Sorry if this is a long one but I am a true believer in sharing everything I know so here goes. We got a good deal on Last Minute to this hotel with flights from Liverpool for 3 nights for under 拢400. Myself  my husband went for an anniversary break and left our little one at home with Nana. As a previous review said, this hotel is not in the tourist area, it is very much amongst where the locals live but don't let this put you off there is nothing to worry about. The only time I felt a little uncomfortable was when we cut down one of the side streets off the Ramblas to get back early one evening, but think it was just me being nervy my husband said he felt fine. I had read alot about bags being snatched and wallets/purses being stolen and you do have to be aware especially in the tourist areas, it is just common sense but we did not see anything while we were there. There is not alot of choice of proper restaurants in the area (mostly locals cafes and small bars) so you really need to walk down to the Ramblas/Port, which on a easy stroll is about 20 mins walk. The hotel was extremely clean and the air conditioning was suberb we really needed it, it was so hot. The bathroom was spacious with lovely big towels. We had a room at the back of the hotel so although we had a view of the flats next door, it was quiet enough to have a good nights sleep and that was more important to us. The safe was great it was FREE and easy to use. I was very surprised at how easy we found the hotel. I read a few reviews on this and other sites (mainly about the hotel) which told you how to get there. We got the Aerobus from right outside the Airport (they are every 8 mins so you never have to wait long) and it was 3.75 euros each. The first stop is Playa Espana and if you get off here you cross the road in front of the twin towers and you are on PARALLEL, it is about a 10 min walk down here and the hotel is on the right. We arrived about 1pm and they let us have our room straight away, the staff were lovely. There is a cash machine just outside the hotel (turn right out of hotel and it is on the right) so we got our money from there we didn't bother with money exchange places. There is enough room in your minibar to put your own water and cans etc.. if you come out of the hotel and turn right after about 5 mins walk there is a supermarket on the right called Condis but just to let you know that is has funny opening times but great for bits and bobs. And there is a lovely little bakery that sells croissants on the same side just before it. We got a 2 day ticket for the Bus Turistic (some reviews said it was an expensive way of getting around) we just wanted to be taken to the main attractions so for 鈧?2 each for 2 days we though it was worth it. We saw the usual things, but I thought the Sagrada Famillia was disappointing. It is about 鈧? each but it is just a building site inside. You can however go up in the lift more or less to the top but I couldn't face it so my husband went up on his own. He got some great pictures but if you are not into art / museums and haven't got a great deal of time you can probably give it a miss. Oh the other thing I forgot to mention is that when you buy your tickets on the hop on hop off bus you get a book of vouchers that gives you some sort of discount on every place you visit as well as many eating places. A must not miss - is the fountains at Playa Espanya but note that they are only on Thurs - Sun at various times from 9pm - Midnight. There are fab and the atmosphere is lovely. The fountains dance to music and lights. On our last night we went to a lovely restaurant on the Ramblas called The Attic mainly fish but the food was lovely and not as expensive as we thought 鈧?6 for 3 courses with wine, water and coffees. Hope all this has been helpful?Have a great time and enjoy!!

<Content>Great Experience Stay in this hotel in April 2006 . This was a great hotel . Just a short walk to La Ramblas and Espanya . Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were neat and always cleaned on time . Close to alot of restuarants. Would not suggest the resturants in the area but the hotel was fabulous. Will go back any day. Cleaning staff are friendly , nice and very pleasant. Metro station just across from the hotel. Poble sec is the name of the metro station . Lot's of cafe's around the area but preferred the food in La Ramblas. If you are booking this hotel then book it with breakfast because it is well worth the money that you pay. Hope you enjoy your stay.

<Content>Excellent value Silkien Continental This hotel is ideally located just off the beaten track to the centre where most of the inhabitants are locals. The rooms are very spacious, clean and well serviced. The rooms were very warm and,as other people have stated, we needed to get a window key to open the window for comfort but it was no effort and the staff were very helpfull. The Reception and bar area is rather small and the bar closed at 11pm but there were many tapas bars and restaurants in the area that afford value. Some were a trifle dingy but plenty to choose from. Transport was great. The buses stop right outside the hotel and the Poble Sec Metro station is opposite the hotel. Tickets for all public transport easily available in the Metro station.The Barri Gotti is a ten minute stroll. A friend who was with us is disabled and had no problems getting around from here. Book early we got it for 35 Euros per room per night.

<Content>Excellent accommodation Stayed here for 10 nights. Room was just as pictured on the Silken Hotels website: --- (one of the smaller rooms, not one with a sofa). We asked for a quiet room so were given a room at the back of the hotel (no view but very quiet). Good wardrobe space, minibar, TV with 2 english speaking channels, room safe, excellent air conditioning but no tea/coffee making facilities. Bathroom was really roomy, lots of space for toiletries and had a hairdryer. Plenty of hot water for baths/showers and everything was really clean. Good breakfast... fruit juices, fresh fruit, muesli, cornflakes, cold meats, cheese, croissants, bread rolls etc but limited hot food (eggs/omelette  bacon/continental sausage). Breakfast is served from 7:30-10:30 however had to queue several mornings as there are only 2 (overworked) staff who struggle to serve tea/coffee, keep the buffet topped up and clear the tables at the busy times. The restaurant area is very pleasant, however as another reviewer said, there is no proper bar area and the few comfy seats in the reception area where you could sit with a drink are usually filled. The hotel is located straight across the street from the poble sec metro station, the metro is excellent, a 10 journey ticket (T-10) is around 鈧?.30. The area around the hotel is nice enough but not touristy so shops  restaurants are frequented by locals  good value. I recommend you buy bottled drinks etc from the small grocers next to the stairs down to the metro (less than half the price of tourist areas). There is a good ( very cheap) chinese restaurant about 10mins walk towards the harbour on the other side of the street on a corner and there are many street cafes serving tapas close by.I had a great time in Barcelona and I would certainly consider staying in the Silken Concordia again.
