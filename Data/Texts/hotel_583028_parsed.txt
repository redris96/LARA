<Content>Great place to stay in. We were a family of four and booked connecting executive rooms on the 16th floor. The rooms were supposed to have been newly renovated and the staff seemed very proud to show them off to us!!! But have to say the rooms were amazing. There were touch screen controls for everything - lights, door bell, make up room and do not disturb. Everything could be controlled from the bed side. There was a 40 LCD TV - which did have some problem of being fused out when we arrived but they corrected it very quickly after we mentioned it to them. The bathrooms were great with a tub and very clean. The view from the top was gorgeous and you could a whole lot of the city. We enjoyed looking out of the floor to top windows whenever we had a chance. Beds were soft and lovely, fell asleep as soon as we got into them. Staff were very helpful and would correct anything quickly if we needed. The buffet breakfast the next day had the usual choices. I guess it was the usual, standard fare that is available everywhere 鈥?nothing special. We had to wait for a long time almost always to get into the crowded breakfast room as there were many tour groups staying at the hotel. All the days we were there it was really full with many tour groups coming and going. We did order room service for dinner once and have to say the food is terrible here and comes quite a bit of time after ordering, so you would do better to just go to any of the great restaurants in Singapore or even the food courts. We went into one of the food courts once but you better be sure you know what you are getting and ask the locals if it is anything good for a foreign taste as sometimes strange tastes otherwise get into your plates. (Well we do like to experiment with food so would try out new stuff 鈥?but some of the food on offer is really strange for foreign tongues). But if you have a local with you, you can get amazing food at the food courts. Back to the hotel, the swimming pool is on the rooftop and is dismally small - like 3 bath tubs put together, so don鈥檛 hope for a exercising swim there. However staff overall was quite good. I needed the internet in my room and they had a package which had free internet at the rate we took (200Sing $ per night per room). They gave me an ethernet cable to plug my laptop into but this was broken and so kept disconnecting and after asking for a replacement after rummaging through the wires they gave me another one in the same condition. And in any case the internet connection was not great and kept dropping off and sometimes I couldn鈥檛 even get logged in. Well so much for the 鈥渇ree internet.鈥?br/>As someone mentioned yes it is difficult to get a taxi here so it helps sometimes to get the hotel to ring for one earlier on. Its about a 5-15 min walk (depending on how fast you walk 飦? to get to the Bugis market where there are food courts and shops to look around and shop and also the Bugis Station Mall for more better quality stuff and some good restaurants. So overall a well placed hotel which is a great place to stay but not to eat in. And well placed enough to have things to do around it.

<Content>Loved The Staff Kudos to the staff especially reception desk and business center. Special mention goes to Carmen in Reception and Nicole in Business Center for going out of their way to accomodate our requests and assuring that we have a pleasant stay. I even got a greeting card signed by the staff on my birthday. The breakfast buffet could however use more variety so you don't get tired of eating the same thing every day.Will definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Singapore especially those who are visiting Singapore for the first time.Rita From Vancouver Canada

<Content>Good location but... My family and I stayed at this hotel for 1 night while we were in Singapore. This hotel was well located, within walking distance to CityHall MRT and Bugis MRT - both of which have shopping malls, food courts etc. The room was quiet, spacious and newly renovated, so it was quite comfortable. We are a family of 4, and they provided a baby cot at no extra charge. The only real disappointment was the breakfast - if I had known it was going to be so bland I would have eaten elsewhere. Literally, all of the food we had, had no taste.  Overall, I would probably stay here again, as it was reasonably priced and the staff were courteous.

<Content>No problems Stayed for 3 nights on Singapore Airlines stopover and found this hotel much better than some of the earllier reviews suggest. The room was fine - looked to be recently refurbished - and building noise didnt affect us (there was a building site next door which would affect rooms on one side of the hotel). Staff helpful and polite. Restauarant limited but there are plenty of eating places round about - the hotel is very centrally located. Found it to be good base for touring the city. Looked similar to many other modern hotels in this part of the city

<Content>Need to do a lot better for this price!!! I stay in Singapore quite regularly and i have never been this disappointed with a Hotel in Singapore before. I am paying a fortune for this dump. The rooms are shabby and smell of damp. Wall paper is peeling and lamp shades and curtains are stained from water i guess?? I expect a lot! lot! more for the price i am paying for this place.

<Content>Great location, very comfortable rooms We stayed in one of the Executive rooms during the Singapore airshow in February 2008. We booked it using the hotel website and got an excellent deal. The hotel room was very comfortable, spacious and clean. Renovations were taking place during the day but these could be mostly ignored. We were sightseeing most of the day so the work had little effect on us. There was a good selection at the buffet breakfast - you'd have to be very fussy not to find good edible food. The staff were very polite, friendly and eager to please. The one criticism of the hotel was the archaic system they used for hotel guests accessing the hotel's internet facilities in their business centre. The location of the hotel was great, being near Raffles and the Chimes restaurants. Also the metro was within easy walking distance as were many bus routes. We had a wonderful time and would certanily return to that hotel and recommend it to others.

<Content>Not Pleasant I stayed here as I had a night in transit with Singapore Airlines. What a disappointment!! Singapore Airlines really ought to ditch this Hotel as a strategic Partner. The place is awful. I stayed in Room 540 and it really was quite poor - and I'd actually been looking forward to staying in one of those plush Singapore Hotels I'd heard and read about on the web!! The plumbing was noisy, the shower nozzle sprayed water everywhere and frankly the restaurant was devoid of any choice on the menu. The oriental food I chose was disgusting. Stay well away from the Royal @ Queens - there can't be any worse options!!

<Content>You can find better I'm sure We stayed here for 3 nights in a renovated room which I must say was very nice. However there were renovations from about 9am to 5pm and because of the heat we went back to relax in the hotel each day. The 'included' breakfast is the worst I have ever had and I've travelled throughout Asia and Africa in various classes of hotels. After the first morning we ate around the corner at another cafe. This appears to be a hotel for tour groups and often people were yelling in the corridors at other people. I wouldn't recommend this hotel and am sure you could find better for the price. Location was good however.

<Content>Overpriced Didn't choose the best time to go due to the overlap with the Aerospace Exhibition so hotel rates skyrocketed. Asiarooms.com offered the cheapest rates but no immediate confirmation. All the hostels were completely booked. Ended up paying $100 US per night for Royal at Queens, a bit northeast of Orchard Road, by Sim Lim Square. Location was great given that basically anywhere in Singapore is within walking distance anyway, breakfast was included, service was alright, but the room itself and the gym was a bit of a disappointment. The room really needs a bit of renovation as the bathroom wall tiles were all moldy, and there were ants crawling around the bathroom taps. The springs in the bed mattress were a bit loose but I was only really concerned about having a bed to sleep on so it didn't bother me much. The gym consisted of 2 treadmills, 1 bike and 1 elliptical machine, all packed in 10 x 5 ft space (I'd say smaller than a 6 tatami room). Having seen the gym, I just didn't bother with the pool. Given the price I was paying though, they could do better. Would recommend it over staying in Geylang but Allson just around the corner did seem nicer. Correct me if I'm wrong but overall, maybe especially at the time I went, hotels in Singapore are just overpriced.

<Content>great location but not 4 star. I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights on a Singapore airlines stopover deal in October 2007. The check in service was great, friendly  helpful concierge and tour desk staff. Although the room was dated and older style it was clean  comfortable. Room service was cheap and great food. Loved the breakfast buffet, great selection of food. Really liked the location, easy walk to Raffles, hop on/off bus, 7/11 store and hawker stalls/night market right next door. This hotel connects with the Allson on floor 2 so you can take a short cut through Allson instead of walking around the block. I would stay here again however have booked 2 rooms for my family at Allson for December 2008 holiday-similar price but a bit nicer.

<Content>Not that bad There are a lot of bad reviews for this hotel, But the 5 nights me and my wife stayed there, we had an enjoyable stay. The rooms were old but comfortable, the bathroom was well worn, that would be the only thing that i could say that i was not happy with. The service was great and the breakfast was even better, it was a feast of bacon, eggs, rice , noddles, cereal and to many more to name. Great value for money and I would stay there again.

<Content>Desparately needs upgrading This was an overnight stopover arranged by Singapore Airlines. Because it was only one night, and we weren't paying for it directly, we could put up with it, but I would never pay the posted rates to stay there. The room we stayed in costs S$250. The room was okay in size, but it smelled of stale smoke. The bathroom tiles were mouldy. There are nice details in the woodwork, and there is a good hawker centre around the block, but these are not enough to make me want to stay here again. A note in the room said they are upgrading the rooms, floor by floor. One can only hope the upgrades will make the hotel worthy of what they're charging.

<Content>the dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed in This hotel was dirty, in need of urgent renovations. The bathrooms were moldy, the decor was very tired and goodness knows what was growing in the air vents. The comb supplied by the hotel was useful for jamming in the wardrobe door to keep the light off. The reception staff were not particularly interested in any of our concerns about the hygiene standards of the room. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Comfortable stay in the hotel I read a lot of negative reviews about the hotel but when I stayed there in June 27-30, 2007, I found that the hotel was not that bad at all. I was asked to deposit S$50 to cover for any incidentals that were not included in my package. We were a party of three and we were billeted at a non-smoking area in the 12th floor. The room was clean and the tv, ref, phone, aircon and lights were all functioning well. The faucet and shower in the bathroom were all working well also. Everyday, our room was clean up and we had fresh supplies of toiletries. The breakfast was buffet and the food choices were just enough to cater to different tastes of the different international travelers.Overall, our stay at the hotel was comfortable. And if I return to Singapore on a limited budget, I will still prefer the hotel as it is a few blocks away to City Hall MRT station, Chjimes, Raffles Hotel, Bugis and Suntec.

<Content>Poor accomodations I have read reviews of this hotel and tried to ask our travel agent not to book us with this hotels , but she said Singapore then was full ( better to book through the internet). Anyway, we were a party of 20. The rooms given to us were all smoking rooms, inspite of the request for nonsmoking rooms. The employees were kind to transfer us the following day to better smelling rooms. But the bathrooms had stains on the floor, would flood when one takes a bath, the rubber mats looked old and filthy. There was a night when the hotel had a power brownout, and we could not go into our rooms, until we asked that the manager bring us into the room with his key - ..The saving factor of this hotel is its staff. Otherwise, there are better hotels in Singapore...

<Content>Beware of the Royal@Queens Singapore My wife and I recently stayed at the Royal@Queens in Singapore, this hotel is registered as a 4 Star hotel, I doubt whether this hotel would rate a 2 Star compared to the other 4 Star hotels we have stayed in in the region of Thailand and malaysia, our reception was I couldnt care less , the room was clean and adequate and situated in a central area, the bathroom was out of this world, or should have been, definitely dodgy. the Dining Room wouldnt have made a good transport cafe it was so bad and the food that was served was equally as bad, no table cloths and the waiter had your plates away before you had finished. On the day that we were leaving we asked if we could keep the room on because we had a 2045 pick up, Answer. No. did they have facilities for guests to have a shower or wash, Answer No, on leaving no goodbye or please come again.We were glad to be out of it, unfortunately the saga didnt finish there, on arriving home in the U.K. I find my credit card had been debited to an amount to which I had no part in, fortunately my bank saw this and stopped it, however, I was left without my credit card for 7 working days, who had the card besides me, the Royal@Queens were the only ones .DONT USE .

<Content>Tired Hotel The hotel room was tired, the wardrobe door wouldn't slide, the shower leaked water all over the floor, the toilet overflowed, the room smelled and looked tired and damp. Light bulbs didn't work, nor did the power point beside the bed and there was no clock.The hotel tour agency lacked competency to begin with. The situation deteriorated progressively when due to the operator's incompetence, a booked tour bus left without us, he put us in a taxi , telling the driver to drop us the middle of nowhere. We learned from the taxi driver we were to make our own way from there on!!! On demand of a refund, which we subsequently got, we were lucky to get our 'free' airport transfers the next day, we were given misinformation about the availability of the service, this experience was not a good look for Singapore, was unexpected and hopefully is not an emerging trend?

<Content>Just okay, not really great Our stay at Royal at Queens was just plain okay. It's nothing spectacular and there were some problems with the hotel. First, the walls in our room needed repainting (or a thorough cleaning). There was a yellowish substance on the walls that kinda looked gross (I think old paint has chipped off) and the sink in the toilet was a little clogged. Housekeeping also left a wet towel (that we didn't use!) on top of our luggage, so of course, our luggage got wet! There was also this irritating housekeeping lady that kept on pressing our doorbell while shouting housekeeping! and so she woke up our tired little baby who was napping!! Can't she just buzz once and wait for a reply rather than push the doorbell again and again?!? Breakfast was again, just ok. Food was plentiful but it wasn't the best. I loved the orange juice though, and the staff there was quite polite. Location-wise, it's okay since it's right behind Allson and there's a good enough foodcourt beside it. Bugis and OG were quite near, although the 10-15 minute walk was kinda tiring if you're carrying a little baby. Overall, Royal at Queens is a little below average. It's definitely not a 4-star hotel!

<Content>Good location but the hotel stinks! Stayed at the Royal on a Singapore Stopover trip. The location was great, it was near the Bugis Street markets and a street away from a 24 hour foodcourt (very good and cheap hawker's food!). However the hotel was in such a terrible state. My room smelled of mold and dampness (like the carpet was wet for a couple of weeks!). The bathroom was such a disaster with cracks on the walls, the vanity and the toilet basin. The hotel staff were abit clueless as to what was happening during the morning. One staff told me the hotel cafe won't open till 10:00 am, as I had an early flight I was at the lobby at 7 am and behold the cafe was serving a buffet breakfast. I did have my breakfast and went to pay, no one was at the cashier, the kitchen staff told me to go away as she didn't want to take my money. I had to literally look for someone who worked in the hotel and gave her the payment for my breakfast! Would not stay there again. And did I mention that everyone staying at the hotel seem to be smoking!

<Content>Less than 4 star! We stayed at this hotel at the end of June this year. It was part of a package with Singapore Airlines. We paid for 3 adults (husband, wife and 14 year old daughter): we were given a double room with an extra bed which effectively meant that you could not walk in the room or store your luggage. On asking reception about these appalling arrangements they were very aloof and unconcerned that they had unhappy guests. Finally, the lobby manager offered us an upgrade to the suite. We paid the difference though I think we would have been better off in another hotel. The suite was more spacious. However,1. The bathroom which is not 4 star standards leaked.2. The bed linen was old with blankets that probably hailed from world war 2.3. The night frills had awful stains which housekeeping said they could not change.4. The breakfast was definitely not 4 star standard.5. The website of the hotel and pictures there are very misleading.Would not recommend this especially if you think that this is a 4 star hotel.

<Content>Not such a good deal I stayed at Royal At Queens for a couple of nights at the end of January 2006. It seemed like a pretty good deal, booked online. Maintenance works were being done to the pipework with what seemed like a very large hammer from 3 to 4AM. This eventually stopped after a call to reception (who didn't think it was a strange hour to use a hammer!)As with most hotels, a credit card swipe was taken for any incidentals, none of which were used, aside from said phone call to reception.Lo and behold, my credit card has charges from the hotel, which I don't notice until my statement arrives.I travel to Singapore two to four times a year and will never stay there again. It will also be at the bottom of my recommendations list for others.
