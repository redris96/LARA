<Content>not 4 star We stayed for 6 nights from 26/6/08..def not 4 star..Breakfasts were appalling e.g. rubbery tomatoes,2 types of inedable chipolatas and a pile of fat which was supposed to be bacon...no cereal spoons,stale bread rolls,no bread left for toast ,no water for tea and milk that was sour.Bathrooms need a door on and not a glass panel.Noise from cafe across road till 7a.m at weekends and air con barely worked.towels looked jaded and well used and the room safe did not work.The bar was closed most of the time  On the plus side most staff were friendly and helpfull and the location 2 mins from las ramblas was fine. It has the appearance of a hotel being run on a shoestring .With a bit more ambition it could be quite a nice hotel but because of the size of the rooms no more than 3 star

<Content>very helpful staff This hotel is well situated, very clean and comfortable. The staff went out of their way to be helpful and we were able to leave our luggage until the evening of our departure. The breakfast buffet was well varied, the only suggestion would be an extra coffee machine as a queue formed at busy times.

<Content>Would go back My fiance and I stayed at the Sansi Diputacio for three nights, and would have no hesitation in going back or recommending it to friends. The staff were helpful, the rooms were clean and well-presented, and the continental breakfast was a good start to the day. The location is near perfect - only two blocks up from the Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas, close to the Gaudi sites but benefitting from the quieter side street location. As other reviews have pointed out - Yes, the rooms are on the small side (as you would expect from a City centre hotel!), but the decor is stylish and well maintained. If you're sharing a room with someone, make sure you know them well - the uber-cool bathroom door does not afford much privacy!

<Content>This defiitley not 4 star hotel My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights Oct 07. Was not entirely disapointed with the hotel however, the rooms were too small, definitley looked alot bigger on the website. I found that our room was also very noisy could hear various loud noises throughout the night. We found that most clubs and bars in this area were gay establishments although if you are willing to walk there are other clubs further into the city. There was also a leak outsideour room in the corridor and at onet there was no hot water for one of the days we were there. The hotel is certainly noy a 4 star however rooms were clean and staff very friendly.

<Content>Great location, clean, poor breakfast Pros: great location in the uptown area - less touristy but good shopping and dining and nicer atmosphere than at Ramblas. Gaudi buildings, metro and airport busses are close. Clean hotel with modern rooms.Cons: poor breakfast (too little choice for the price), bathroom door is a see-thru version and mold smells in the bathroom even though it looks very new.

<Content>Not a 4 star, would not recommend This hotel boasts about its four star rating but its more like a 2 or 3 star in terms of the size of the rooms, the functionality of the restroom, and the hospitality (which there was essentially very little of). The rooms were way too small bc the beds took up most of the room. I stayed with my mom and we're both petite women but we found this place very cramped. Also, the bathroom is ridiculous bc the door is clear and the shower door only covers half the shower (this door is also clear) so there was always water on the floor. Final words: find another hotel.

<Content>'Superb-cannot believe other reviews' Booked this hotel through 'Octopus Travel' as is was a good price and it was one of their top picks. I booked this for my wife's birthday gift so I was very worried about some of the previous reviews i had read on this website. our experience could not be any different. The reception desk staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating and friendly. Upon arriving they checked us in very quickly and even though it was 3 hours before we were due to have our room, they insisted on taking our cases straight up and give us our room with no extra charge. The room itself was great. A very comfortable bed, bathroom with a huge shower, air conditioning and everything clean which it was kept like that everyday. On going out to explore the desk staff again were very friendly and asked if they could be of any assistance and told us not to hesitate to ask them for help. All I can say is that I would definitely go back to this hotel and cannot understand some of the comments left by other user's. Definitely recommended.

<Content>Nightmare Experience I booked this hotel in October 2006 through a travel agent as it was for my 40th Birthday and I was going with 6 friends. Needless to say we were all looking forward to our trip to Barcelona immensely. Four of us arrived from Birmingham on a Thursday night approximately 11pm. to be greeted by the hotel porter who informed us that the hotel was full. We explained that we had made and paid for our reservations months ago. He explained that the computer system went down the day before and had lost all bookings. This was quite obviously a lie. He explained that he would have to try and find us a local hotel in the area for the night. He spent one hour on the phone ringing around but to no avail. Eventually he offered us a drink at the closed bar, no other staff in the hotel. He was very rude and adamant that this in fact was no fault of his. Finally at 1am. he contacted a sister hotel and found us two twin rooms, how convenient. We are still wondering why he didn't try them in the first place and it would of saved us two ours of an already stressful night. He explained that we get a taxi to the hotel and back to the original hotel, to keep the receipts and we would be reimbursed and that our rooms would be ready the next morning. The sister hotel was approx. 15mins. away by taxi, when we arrived we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who had our keys ready. We took the lift to the fourth floor where our rooms were and when we got to the floor we founf that there were no lights on in the hallway, once the lift door was shut it was complete darkness. We had to use a mobile phone to find the room number. We came back down for a very well earned drink and explained about the lights, she had to bring us back up with a torch. 4* I don't think so. The next morning we got a taxi back to our original hotel Sansi Diputacio only to find that the rooms would not be ready until 3pm., this was 10am. At this point we have yet to see any of Barcelona, hang up our clothes or get settled. The receptionist then blamed the incident on the travel agency we booked it with which was nonsense. We couldn't understand why there were no rooms ready knowing that cleaning staff started at 7am. only to be told the staff were on a training course. At this point we just could not believe what was happening. We then explained that we needed to be reimbursed for the taxi journey. After much negotiation they agreed to pay for the taxi to the hotel the night before but not for the return journey as it was not company policy. At this point we felt it best to leave the hotel and go for a walk. When we eventually got in to our rooms we were told that we could not open the windows as it was against the law but the only problem was that the air conditioning was not working. The hotel was boiling. I cannot express enough how badly treated we were. I would never recommend this hotel chain to anybody if it was the last place on earth. My birthday celebrations were completely ruined and we never at any stage got an apology. All in all - apalling.

<Content>Not a 4 star by any stretch I'm not sure when this hotel was rated, but these days I wouldn't put it ahead of a 2 star Ibis, but for at least twice the price. Location is great, and that is as far as it goes. Shabby rooms, tiny beds, no toiletries in the bathroom, no towel rails etc etc etc. The breakfast defies description. Do not stay here.

<Content>Not worth 4 stars Even though the location is quite good (few steps from Plaza Catalunya or Paseo de Gracia), I was quite dissappointed of this Hotel. The rooms looked shabby, even though renovated (suppose some years ago). There was a certain smell which I could not define and the windows from inside (there was some kind of yard and a small small square around which the hotel was built) did not get much fresh air and transported every noise from 2 floors below (if the window was open as well).the sheets were not the cleanest ones neither.personnel was very friendly though...

<Content>to bad to be true i stayed 1 night on january 1, first we were assigned a room that had not been cleaned (at 6 in the afternoon) we were given another room but this one had no water, this resolved we had no hot water (we were told by other guests that this problem was 4 days old) we were imformed that this problem was outside the hotel. At 10.:30 we went to the lounge area and the receptionist practicly kiked us away closing the tv and telling us we could not stay there. The room although modern were filled with defects, like electric cables hanging. I don麓t know how this is a 4 star hotel.stay away from this hotel if you can

<Content>Lovely welcoming environment Having read some of the reviews before setting off my fiance and I were positively terrified of what we might find at this hotel.On arriving we were greeted by 3 members of staff, our cases were immediately taken from us and carried to our room for us as we checked in. A map was produced where one of the staff members pointed out where the hotel was and gave us information on where all the main attractions were and how to get to them. We were then taken to our room where the helpful staff member showed us how to work all the amenities. We were very pleasantly surprised at our room as we had expected to find no toiletries, no towels and broken windows from the reviews we had read. The rooms are lovely, if a little on the small side, all done in wood panelling. There was every toiletry imaginable in the bathroom, along with 4 large towels and a bathrobe and pair of slippers which I was very impressed with. The rooms were cleaned daily and we were even left a second robe and pair of slippers after the first day - we were also given fresh robes.I'm sure if you were looking for things to complain about then you could find something. There were a few tiles missing from the shower and the rooms could probably use a little more maintenance but overall I couldn't find fault with the place. The breakfasts were perhaps not the best I've ever had - there was not a huge variety but we always left with full stomachs. The staff were lovely, always making an effort to speak to you when you left or returned, asking how you enjoyed your day and helping you find places.I would advise that you take advantage of the Bus Turistic which is 21 euros for a 2 day pass and you can get on or off at all the major sights as often as you like (you can pick the bus up at Plaza de Catalunya) There is also an airport bus from just outside the airport that takes you directly to Plaza de Catalunya so the hotel is very conveniently located. We did find that eating out was a bit of a problem - most of the restuarants tend to be more cafe/bars where u sit at the bar and eat your food there. We had been looking forward to splashing out on some nice meals in restaurants. If you try further down La Rambla we found a few more places there.All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend this hotel. We sustained no bites from bed bugs (As complained about by a previous reviewer - I suspect these may have been misquito bites). If you are looking for the Hilton then stay in the Hilton. If you are looking for your basic city hotel with a touch of class then try this one.

<Content>Find yourself another hotel I have stayed at Sansi for 5 days in August 2006. Can you imagine a 4-star hotel that is dirty with dust everywhere, with stain in the bathtub, with stained towels, have to ask to get the right number of towels everynight, with slow breakfast service, who use water to dilute the hand soap and shower soap (I have to go to supermarket and bought my own shower gel in the end)?Though the location is good, you can get a much better experience at this price.Go find another hotel!

<Content>Not even close to a four-star We were recommended this hotel by a local business associate as it was right in the heart of town. Upon arriving, we were immediately disappointed by the room: glass door on the bathroom, window did not lock, size of the room. We started in one room only to discover the window did not lock-not a plus when you have small children; also, the shower was not the cleanest and there were no bars of soap (no toiletries were provided at all). We had also reserved a crib for the baby but it was not in the room, and when we asked the reception for it, we were told there was no mattress. Thankfully, this problem was rectified and we eventually got a crib.We were moved to the adjacent room due to the window not locking and this move was done pretty smoothly thanks to the dark-haired female receptionist who herself helped move the stuff. It was horribly warm in the room (even though it was April the weather was great) so we turned on the airconditioning only to discover that it was on heating-only mode and could not be changed to cooling. We ended up having to leave the window ajar while we were out to cool the room.The water in the toilet was running constantly so we called reception and they did send someone up to fix it, which he did. However, we then took a shower only to discover there was no hot water. Again, we called the reception and maintenance never showed up.There was a club across the street and the noise from this club at night was very loud in the wee hours of the morning and so were the motorbikes and scooters. On top of that, we were awakened at 03:00 AM every night by the neighbours watching porn TV turned up loudly in their room next door while they cheered on boisterously to whatever turned them on.It is worth mentioning that the female receptionist on day duty were very helpful, cheerful and pleasant. They went out of their way to help and to guide us.Other than the location and the female receptionist we certainly do not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Not 4 star standard. Very noisy! Hotel is 4 star but facilities would only rate 2 or 3 compared with other places I've stayed. A small over-priced bar in the lobby. No restaurant except a rather average breakfast room. Room was the noisiest room I've ever stayed in  I've stayed in some very noisy places in my time! Even for a city hotel, noise was incredible. Sound insulation was non-existent, the club opposite generated loud noise some nights (not music but people in the street shouting and whistling as only over-exuberant young people  drunks can) and overnight deliveries to the bars nearby involved the dropping of many metal beer kegs and crates of bottles. Traffic noise until 3 or 4 am. There were occasional periods of comparative quiet between 5  6 am before the traffic started up again. In the bathroom (with its glass door!) you could hear the seagulls on the roof 6 floors above as well as every flush and emptying sink. The noises came down the service ducting. Noisy airconditioning too! Not recommended!

<Content>Made to feel very welcome I found this hotel really good. It is in a fantastic location being a short walk from Plaza de Catalunya and the Ramblas but still situated in a nice quiet area. We found the glass bathroom door quite amusing but it does give some privacy as it is patterned and does not look directly on to the main part of the room.It wasn't particularly luxurious for what I would have expected of a four-star but it was very clean, bright and modern.The staff were excellent. Most spoke English and were so helpful both in hotel matters and more general advice about the city. We were made to feel very welcome and one receptionist even took time to help me with my limited attempts at Catalan.

<Content>Careless and hostile management Think twice before booking ! This people don't care if you stay there: No soap in bathroom, twice out of 5 days rooms were not cleaned by 18:00 (when asked front desk says they clean by order of check out but why should you care ?), one of 2 elevators doesn't reach 7 floor, service at breakfast is very very slow.When talking to management they care about the nice outside fasadebut not about those already in. Do yourself a favour, find another hotel.

<Content>Overated hotel The hotel is centrally located near plaza Catalunya, La Pedrera and Casa Battlo with easy access to the metro. Things to be aware of:1. Water from the bar is probably the most expensive in the world. EUR 12 per litre.2. In case you need anything from housekeeping e.g. blankets, etc you better ask for it early in the day as you won't be able to have anything delivered to you at night.3. Even though it is rated a four star hotel, bed sheets are not changed daily!4. Breakfast buffet needs a lot of work to reach a 4 star buffet level5. Pleasant and helpful receptionists

<Content>Impressed and relieved! I was more then a little worried after booking my stay at this hotel when I read some of the reviews on this site but the hotel was great. We arrived and had drinks at the bar. True there were no cocktails and we had to mime certain things to the bar man but measures were huge, there was a pianist playing and everything looked very smart.The rooms were good. True having a glass bathroom door is a little odd but at least it was an amusing conversation piece. The air con for all 4 rooms we had worked perfectly well and the beds were extremely comfortable.Location is great - 5 mins walk from Ramblas but totally quiet at night. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone going to Barcelona on a budget but who wants to stay somewhere clean, smart, convenient and relaxing.

<Content>Good hotel, shame about the bar prices. Breakfast on two out of three mornings was a complete shambles. Not enough cereal bowls, hot water, rolls, hot food. Tables were not cleared and there was only one (very overworked but very pleasant) young lady on duty to clear, clean and refresh the breakfast bar. The only way to overcome the problem is to eat as soon as the breakfast room opens. According to very helpful reception staff, the problem is caused by a great number of guests going into breakfast within the short time span of 9 to 9.30 a.m! The room (which couldn't be labelled as a restaurant) did not appear to be open for either lunch or dinner despite being advertised as such. The price of drinks at the bar put the most expensive hotels in London to shame. Four gin and tonics and one martini and lemonade were 90 euros with tax! 拢12 each! Very helpful but very overworked reception staff agreed that a price list should be displayed over the bar so that guests are fully aware of the extortiante prices before ordering. Room keys do not always work!

<Content>NO MORE The hotel is well placed and the rooms are cleaned but:1)The first day we had no soap at all in the room. We had it the following evening after our third request!2)The safe in our rooms does not work at all. We had to leave our values to the reception.3)The magnetic key has some serious problem: we had to change the card every day and sometimes only the receptionist card let us enter in our room!4)The plugs close to the mirror in the bathroom does not work. We report the problem but no action has been taken (maybe forgot between the other).5)It was impossible to lock the windows. It has been said to us that some pieces were missing and so it was not possible to fix them.6)When the we claim that we would like to have a discount due to the ensemble of disservices, it has told us to speak with the guys in the morning, even if it would be very early (4 a.m.).The following morning the guy (also present during the evening before) told us that was too early to speak with the director鈥?br/>7)We also wrote an email to the director, but we had no answer at all.We agree on the fact that, taken one by one, they are not big problems (except the soap) and actually the personnel was very kind and tried to solve the difficulties, but, with the sum of all these issues, we didn鈥檛 have the expected service of a 4 stars hotel!

<Content>Perfect location Hello, my wife and I stayed 6 nights in this hotel (from 19th February till 25th February). The room was clean and indeed the door to the bathroom is a glassdoor. Well it was no problem for us. The breakfast got better every day although we must say that it was a bit poor for a 4 star rated hotel. The location is perfect ... only a 5 to 10 minutes walk to the Ramblas and place de la Catalunya. Overall not bad for euro 690,- including taxes and breakfast. We would recommend this hotel !

<Content>Sansi Diputacio Hotel Review - October 2004 We visited the hotel at the end of October 2004. Hotel was perfectly acceptable. The staff were very helpful and couldn't be more supportive. The rooms were very clean and tidy. An earlier visitor complained about the frosted glass bathroom door, hwoevre, if you are a couple it couldn't be faulted the fixtures and fittings were 1st class. The breakfast was acceptable although the fruit could have been fresher. But the breakfast was perfrectly fine.I would recommend this hotel as both its location, quality and staff were worth the visit to Barcelona. It is very central and accessible to all parts of the city centre.

There is a cocktail bar that doesn't serve cocktails and a breakfast room that didn't really serve breakfast -it was small, understaffed and ran out of food on more than one occasion!Unlike in some of the other reviews of this hotel the air conditioning was working when we stayed the safe however in the room wasn't working and wasn't fixed during the week that we stayed there.On the plus side the hotel and room were clean and the reception staff friendly but I wouldn't stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Worst Hotel:AVOID While the hotel is intitially lovely and well-located, the charm wore off quickly. The air-conditioning was turned off each night in the summertime (the manager lied and told me there was a problem with the water in Barcelona??), the breakfast was appalling (filthy + unrefrigerated dairy products...I ended up eating at the cafe across the street), and most days my room was never cleaned, which has never happened to me at any hotel in my life-and this is a 4-Star hotel. The desk staff is lovely, but the managers in suits are nasty and unscrupulous. My first night I was jolted awake by another guest, half-dressed, screaming in the lobby below (I could hear him in my room a few flights up) because they had switched off the air-conditioning (it was July and hot!).

<Content>Strange Hotel in an OK location My wife and I stayed 4 nights at this hotel (at the end of May 2004) which is just around the corner from the University and perhaps a 10 minute walk from the Placa Cataluyna. The nearest Metro stop is about 3 blocks away.The hotel is of high tech design. Here are some of the strange things:1) In the main floor public Toilet, there is not a soap dispenser. You use shampoo from the tiny jars.2) In our room, the bathroom door is see through glass. When you pass by the door, you look the other way because your wife doesn't want you to look at her while she is sitting on the toilet.3) The provided room amenities included a sewing kit, toothbrush and toothpaste, bars of soap, raxor and shaving cream, but NO shampoo or bath gel. When they later provided the shampoo and bath gel, it was delivered with the caps removed (maybe they got it from the main floor W.C.)4) Ten days after the previous review, the air conditioning was still not functioning. During our last two nights at this hotel, the rooms were so hot(over 80 degrees F ) they a few peole on our floorleft their doors fully open during the night. As in the previous review, the hotel was not at all apologetic. I was told that the Air Conditioning did not work because it was cold last week. Makes no sense.5) At 4PM on the last day of our stay our room had not been cleaned. I brought this to the attention of the apparent boss. It never was cleaned and there was never an apology.Most of the staff was wonderful. The bellhops and the women at the front desk were great. The men in the suits who seem to make the management decisions are a problem.This could have been a great hotel, but it is clearly poorly managed. Rate was 165 Euros per night plus tax. Breakfast per person would be an additional 13 Euros per person ( We tried it once and decided that it was an incredibly poor value for 13 Euros each -- small selection of only cold items and near rotten fruit )

<Content>A few kinks, but overall a good find Upon arriving, I thought great location, bright, inviting lobby, friendly service - this is a find. however, i must say, my recent stay hit a few bumps. First off, the room wasn't ready when we checked in (which, truth be told, was on the early side), which wasn't a problem, but when we returned to the hotel at 5pm that evening, they had given our room to someone else, thus adding another 1/2 hour delay to us being able to get to our room. The room itself is really quite nice - we didn't have a view of anything special, but the room was spacious, clean, bright, modern, and new, as was the bathroom. However, the air conditioning in the building was not working, making for a very uncomfortable sleep, and upon checkout, the concierge was unapologetic. If they can iron out a few kinks, I think this hotel is a definite find considering its great location and modern style.

<Content>Convenient Sansi Diputacio This hotel could not be more convenient. Just behing Placa Cataluna. Only a few months old and very well presented as you would expect from a 4* hotel. Quite small so breakfast can get quite busy. Helpful English speaking staff.The hotel is just a few yards to all the key bus routes and the metro. Is on a quiet road in a quite vibrant part of the city. Plenty of good and also plenty of Tapas bars nearby.A real find and at present has some very good offers.
