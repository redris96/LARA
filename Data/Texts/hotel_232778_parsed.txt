<Content>This is nice hotel We just got back from here. We stayed from 30 December 2008 to 2 January 2009. Perhaps the hotel has changed a lot since the other reviews were written but I was dreading going there after reading what is written on here.These are our findings:Check in/ReceptionPerfectly nice and polite staffThe reception area is clean and contrary to other reviews does not smell of drainsThe roomWe had a room on the 4th floor facing the back of the hotel. It was a good size with a balcony. The room had nice decor and was light because of the two large windows. A safe is provided in the wardrobe. The bed was rock hard and the pillows were not what you could describe as plump! BathroomThe bathroom was clean and had a good, powerful shower. The towels were slightly thin but perfectly acceptable.NoiseWe experienced a little bit of noise on thefirst night but none thereafter. The noise came from groups of drunken English speaking men on the street. Drunken Brits abroad - Spaniards must love us.BreakfastYou can pay 10 Euros to have a set breakfast in the hotel. This consists of bacon, eggs, toast, orange juice and tea/coffee. However the breakfast room is also a cafe which is open to the public so you can actually have what you want. There are a lot of places to eat on La Rambla anyway.SafetyThe hotel is perfectly clean, safe and secure. There is a sex shop a couple of doors down and 'ladies of the night' do congregate around there but the position of this shop is further down La Rambla than you would probably would be walking down so you would probably not need to walk past it at night. It is no worse than Soho in London.Location of the hotelIt is right on La Rambla towards the bottom end. This is right in the heart of the most touristy area. Think Leicester Square in London. Yes it is busy and yes there are street performers lining each side of the street. However it is easy to get from the hotel to most of the places of interest and the closest metro station to the hotel is about a 2 minute walk away.Overall for a 2* hotel I found this one above average. It is clean, safe, with pleasant staff and is in a very central location. We booked through last minute.com and got 3 nights with return flights form Gatwick for 2 people for 700 pounds sterling. At New Year. Value-wise I think this was fine.Thankfully the reviews I read prior to traveling to Barcelona were nothing like my experience.

<Content>Hotel ok for the price we payed We stayed for 4 nights Oct 10th/14th to do the 2 day international walks of Barcelona. We payed for a basic room and that is what we got. No daylight in the room but as we only slept in the room this was ok. Yes the La Rambla is a 24 hour street. We left the hotel at 5-30 on both sat/sun mornings it was very busy. I also was pickpocketed on the underground and yes they are very good.I was just one of many on the same day.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in Nov and paid 拢150 for a superior room. Could find no faults with this hotel, recpetion staff were friendly, helpful and spoke good english. The room we stayed in was clean and nicely decorated, we had a balcony which opened onto la rambla and the room also had the use of a free safe. We could not hear much noise from outside and yes there is a sex shop a few doors down but there are a few of these down la ramblas anyway.I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to others, great location.

<Content>Centrally located but noisy and old Great La Rambla location. But along with that comes noise all night long. We were on the 3rd floor with a balcony, which was fun and entertaining during the evening. But being on La Rambla means you get to hear what goes on all night long. One thing not mentioned, is that the hotel is 2 doors away from a Peep Show/Adult store. We had to take an early morning flight and got up at 4:30am to hookers all around. Made us wonder who used our beds before we got there...Lobby is beautiful. Staff was friendly. But the room was decorated in the '70's probably and not remodeled since. Bed felt like it was stuffed with straw or horsehair. I think the sofas in the halls would make for a more comfortable night's sleep.

<Content>Great location but some rooms are awful I booked this hotel purely for its location - on the bottom part of La Rambla and only five minutes' walk from the sea to the south and Placa de Catalunya in the north. The staff are generally very friendly although on occasion one in particular would ignore us completely (this may be more of a Barcelona thing that just this hotel as it also happened in a shop and a restaurant too). Our room (220) was pretty unsatisfactory - as another traveller observed some rooms face inwards to a tiny courtyard that is four storeys high, which affords the room no natural light at all. My friend and I had trouble telling whether or not it was daylight when we woke up, even on the sunniest of days. I'm not a big fan of artificial lights but they had to be on all the time we were in the room. Other than that it was perfectly clean and habitable though, and a free safe in the room isn't something you find everywhere.A big warning to all those travelling to Barcelona - pickpockets are rife and damn they're good! I lost my wallet from an inside pocket literally between paying in a cafe and carrying the tray to a table. No idea how it was taken but please take every care yourselves. I knew of the problem before I left and felt I was being extremely vigilant throughout but still someone saw an opportunity. As I say it is rife - when I informed the hotel they sympathised and told me that three thieves had a few minutes earlier been arrested by police outside the hotel (not mine though unfortunately!).I didn't let it spoil the stay though and am looking forward to returing to see the bits I missed this time round. If I do stay in the hotel again - I'm not entirely discounting it but the price would have to be right - I will ensure that I have a room that faces outwards!

<Content>Dingy room with no view The main issue with this hotel is the varying quality of room, unfortunately our room was absolutely horrible and in no way worth the 140 Euro that we paid. The hotel lobby and foyer are very nice, as are the pictures on the website, but these pictures are deceptive, the room was old, small and dark. It seems that some of the rooms are nice, but there is no indcation when you book online which standard of room you will get. We are pretty easy going and not fussy, in fact most of our travels we stay in youth hostel private doubles, but because we were unwell we decided to recuperate in a hotel. The room was of a lesser quality than many of the hostels we have recently stayed in and we were told that it was the last available room and that we could not swap.This is a good lesson about booking online. Although I would have to say we are fairly discerning when it comes to online bookings and so in this case it was a blatent misrepresentation. We used 'easy to book, online reservations', I think they also have an obligation to research the properties to ensure true representation of ALL rooms not just a priveledged few.

<Content>Brilliant Brilliant hotel!! A two star that should be a three star!!We stayed for three nights on a mid-week city break  the only issue was a flickering light which was sorted within 24hrs of mentioning it.As other people have mentioned, do not believe the bad reviews - it is perfect for travelling couples who need a decent room as a base.I have already recommended this hotel  as I work in Customer Services it made a real impression with me -  that takes some doing!!

<Content>Great little pearl Stayed in the hotel for about a week. It was going through renovation at the time. The staff made sure that the noise won't bother me and even moved me to another room (a double room, even though I booked and payed for a single one), to make sure I'm not bothered by the noise. The staff was great.The location's amazing - right on La Ramblas. Close to the tube station, the beach and Barry Gothic. Lots of restaurants and shops nearby. Rooms are really big (not only when compared to the European standard). Bath is clean, so are the sheets etc. Great stay, great value. The area feels pretty safe, though I wouldn't recommend walking in the little Barcelona alleys in general, especially for solo travelers like myself (nothing to do with the hotel, just a word of general advice).

<Content>AWFUL - STAY AWAY LOCATION:My daughter (4yrs old) and I arrived at the hotel on the 23rd June. I didn't realise until the taxi pulled outside the hotel that there was a SEX SHOP next door. ROOM:my daughter cried when walked into the room. It was dark dingy and smelt like an open sewer. absolute waste of money.STAFF:The staff were rude and obnoxious and unhelpful.( They wouldn't assist us with our suitcases to our rooms)ADVICE: should book a hotel walking distance from the Ramblas or even an apartment. Which is much better than this.

<Content>Loved it I really don't understand people who complain about this hotel. It's great. Friendly staff, incredibly clean rooms, TERRIFIC location (right in La Rambla, 20-25 minutes' walk and you are on the beach). Has everything you need. Besides, when in Barcelona, you are not really going to sit indoors, are you? Even though it has **, feels like **** in Paris!

<Content>Great value for money and great location I treated my boyfriend to a trip to Baca. We had never been before, and after i booked the hotel i was very worried after reading these reviews, i wold just like to say that if you just need a place to sleep and shower well it is fine. It was veryc lean. I do admit we did have to change the room, but only because the plug in the bath was stuck, nothing serious. The staff were willing to help. The taxi's were on strike coming home and they sorted all transfers out for us, they really went out of their way for us. I admit the room was small but not a problem for a few nights. It was clean and friendly, yeah it isnt the Ritz but what more do you want from a cheap hotel on one a the most famous streets in the world. Anyone who books this hotel dont worry about these reviews unless you are use to luxury. I stayed three nights 10th of june till the 13th and will deffo be returning.

<Content>Great location and value!! Arc la rambla was a really pleasant hotel. They were renovating the hotel when we were there and although we had one of the older rooms it was fine, even though the decoration wasnt great it was clean, spacious and the facilities were good. We were right in the middle of the action and couldnt ask for a better location surrounded by culture and brilliant restaurants!I would definitly recommend this hotel, it is great value for money!

<Content>NOT RECOMMENDED I am not one too complain or write reviews - until now that is. We booked this hotel online knowing it was only two star the pictures they publish is far from what we got! The loby and stair case is all that resembled the advert! We were put on the 5th floor and the lift only went too the 4th floor ( apparently the one lift that goes to the top was out of order) as too was the WIFI and the airconditioning did not work - according to the reception they switch the cooling off in the winter because it is not needed but the room was hot as hell and th window opened up on to a shaft which did not let any air in apart from the airoma of Sewer (according to reception the whole of Barcelona smells like this). The Bed was as hard as the floor and had a horse blanket on it which looked well used. Room was tiny with no bin. Our friends were on a different floor and thier room was worse than ours!! we checked out first thing in the morning and front desk was not happy.We got a 3 star hotel for less further up the La Rambla called Hotel Turin and they where Perfect.

<Content>Arc is OK ! just back from barcelona weekend. Stayed in arc la rambla at 19 La Rambla, booked through booking.com - 'superior twin'. Very nice room, quite simple, very clean. Fab location, five minutes from metro, marina, palau guell, barri gotic, short walk to paral.lel for funicular and cable car trip up montjuic and Miro gallery. Bit noisy from an all night beer kiosk in the alley way at the side of the hotel - recommend ear plugs! We paid 350 euro for three nights and didn't try the breakfast as we like exploring all the little cafes around the area which are great. enjoy your trip.

<Content>Remember !! 2 Euro Coins for Luggage Storage Each Time Y ou Open It This was Great. I mean Great!!!!! Hotel right on the Las Ramblas. Our Room was in the front. had a small Romeo and Juliet balcony . Doors swung open and you could step out see everything all day and all night long. It was soooo cool. It was not noisy. Just the sound s of people outside cleaning, laughter and light city sounds. Kind of quiet actually.The hotel like the area has character and was not built in 2008, but probably in the 1940's or earlier. Therefore, It was not new and it was not large. It is nestled among the buildings and businesses that are common to most older areas around the world. There is something for everybody. ---and everybody was there. If you arrive early you can store your luggage in locked cabinets. However, if you have to return to open them you have to pay all over again. 2 Euros each time. So bring a lot of 2 euro coins just in case the desk runs out.The people at the desk, restaurant and cleaning staff are very kind . Speak slowly. they did not always understand what was said spoken quickly.The hotel is safe and clean. Hotel Arc La Rambla has character and offers the basic things that new large hotels have only on a small scale. It's okay for kids to stay. It's just not enough space for them to run wild. Everything is accessible from the hotel. tours can be booked etc. Mcdonalds , Burger King and high end eating and high end shopping(Plaza Catalonia) very close by.This is a diamond in the rough if there ever was one. I thought it was going to be bad or something. It was fabulous for the price and the experience as as tourist of old downtown Barcelona. I am going back there on my next trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Great location shame about the rest We stayed here for 5 nights from 17th March 2008 - on arrival (late) we were greeted by someone with little or no English and when we checked our room found it was a standard and not a superior as we had booked - after some arguments we were told we had to stay in the room and it would be sorted in the morning - we were offered two days breakfasts complimentary to make up for the difference. The superior room was smaller than the standard and the extra amount we paid for a view with a balcony over las ramblas wasn't really worth it. The breakfast is paltry with hard miniature pastries, cheap fruit juices and a couple of trays of ham and cheese with three options for cereal. hardly worth the 10 euro each. The hotel does look like they've tried to make some upgrades but it still comes off more like a hostel, they have some problems with sewage odours in the central areas which needs addressing and there was some building work going on on the ground floor. By the way they say they have a left luggage area - they don't - they have lockers on the ground floor which you have to pay for. No different than a railway station.

<Content>Poor Hotel Experience The one positive of this hotel is the location. It could not be better. It is in the heart of the tourist district.Unfortunately the negatives completely outweigh the positives. Firstly one of the receptionists was totally rude, unprofessional and uninformative when dealing with any questions we had. As the first person you see in the hotel this was a bad start.The room was too small and too dark for any type of relaxation. Add in the fact that there was no carpet only tiles on the floor and the whole room became very cold. The walls seemed very thin and noise from other rooms (running water,tv,people talking etc.) could be heard easily. The view of drainpipes and stray cats also left a lot to be desired.The breakfast wasn't too bad but a little limited to pastry and cereal type food and not worth the additional 鈧?0 per person.I would not advise anyone to stay here as it will leave you with a bad impression of what is a wonderful city.

<Content>Good Location The location couldn't be better, straight out onto La Rambla and easy walking distance down to the harbour.Hotel is very clean. The room was small and basic but adequate for our two night stay. It was at the back of the hotel and had no view whatsoever. Although the bathroom is clean there is smell of drains and no shower curtain. You need to take your own toiletries.Breakfast is basic continental and not really worth 10 euros, there are plenty of eating places round about.We found the receptionists helpful.Barcelona is fabulous and two nights was not enough! Will definitely return to the city but probably not to this hotel.

<Content>Good location, disappointing room First impression on walking into the hotel was good. Clean and bright reception area. Staff polite. However the room on the second floor we were given was very disappointing. Very dark and dingy. No windows. No view. Couldn't read in bed as no bedside lights. Bathroom window broken, shower broken, toilet not working properly. Workmen next door drilling and hammering from 9am in the morning until 10.30 pm at night. Breakfasts were good and there was a safe in the bedroom which we used. Next time I shall pay more and stay in a three/four star hotel.

<Content>Horrible Booked a double room and we got a twin one. When we asked to chane they refused. I dont know if it was the time of year or a recent problem but the entire hotel and especially our room absolutly stunk of sewage. Really gross.You can tell that half the hotel has been done up and half hasnt but it really was an unsavoury experience. The staff there are some of the rudest people I have met aswell, but to be honest we only met possibly two nice spanish people when over there. The rest were all very impolite.To sum up, we booked in for two nights, had most of our money stolen, was disgusted with the city (unsafe and riddled with thiefs) and the hotel and returned home within 24 hours of arrival

<Content>perfect location Visited barcelona for the second time for 7 nights . great time of the year except for sudden closings of trains, museums and other attractions due to the season. Did catch the Three kings festivities and the biggest sales of the year.The hotel was great a 2 star with some boutique rooms ,4 star sheets. And plenty of very hot and high pressure showers. the only negative was the night time noise at our superior balcony room on the 2nd floor (room 218) The balcony faced the alley between la Rambla and El Raval. ( no view except the first floor roof and apartment dwellers balconies) After midnight groups would congregate before ,during and after the closing of the clubs in the alleys and ther was no way of drowning out the noise except for earplugs and closed door to the balcony. So from trash pickup til 6am it was quite livly every night. Maybe during hotter or colder weather the ac/heater fan noise would take care of most of it but it was too warm to sleep with the heat and it did not have a fan only setting. But it was our choice not to chnge rooms when they became available after 2 nights . The offer was made. Other friends were at 4 stars that did not compare with our great room and location.

<Content>Unhappy with a receptionist We麓re not going to complain about the dark bedroom, the bathroom door that did not lock, or the lack of curtains on the bathtub. Our complaint is about the receptionist that was on duty at the reception desk on January 3, at around 8:00 p.m. After watching her being rude to an American couple, we asked some information about some streets that, according to the guide, were near the hotel. She did not even ask to read the names of the streets, as we might have mispronounced them. She just said:  I don麓t know anything. If you need information, go to the Information Office on the street.  We must add that the receptionist that checked us in on January 1st was very nice and provided us with all the information we needed to travel to Andorra. Besides, the breakfast - 10 euros per person and not included on the price of the room - was excellent and worthwhile. Thank you for readingthis e-mail.  A Brazilian couple

<Content>Arc La Rambla, would not recommed this hotel August 2007 Stayed at this Hotel for 2 nights, the only good thing i have to say about it was that it was clean and there was a safe. The room was small, there was no shower curtain, when having a shower you had to wash yourself and hold the shower in your other hand, the guy at reception was not helpful at all, very rude. When entering the hotel there was a terrible smell and it followed through as you went up the stairs to your room. We had a balcony which was great as the air con was crap, did not work properly. The other group that was with us had rooms with no windows i.e. no air and the air con wasn't much better in their rooms. We got the older rooms in the Hotel, although they seem to be re decorating parts of the hotel. It is ther perfect location for La Rambla and the shopping etc but im sure there are nicer hotels on the strip.

<Content>Great location at a great price! My husband and I just returned yesterday from our European vacation and Arc la Rambla was the last hotel we stayed in. I was very nervous about staying there after reading previous reviews and debated what I would take as a result of the thefts. But I was pleased to find a very modern lobby and helpful staff. Our room was pleasantly large and had a safe which we used for free. The room was very clean and the location could not be beat. I would definitely stay there again. We even felt that it was the best hotel we had stayed in during our whole trip. I only suggest that you take what you need and avoid taking too many valuables that may not fit in the small safe.

<Content>Nice hotel - Great location We stayed here for three nights - great location. The hotel had some very recent remodeling going on, as many halllways were just painted. The only negative, was the room desperately lacked anywhere to put anything. No tables or dressers. Even the bathroom (large) had no place to put anything. The shower head was slightly dirty.We would consider using this hotel again.Because of recent posts, we did take precautions to lock up our valuables in the closet using a luggage lock.

<Content>Could not be better I had read some terrible reviews on this hotel and began to wonder what I had let myself in for. On arrival, we were allocated a superior room, as there was some problem with an ordinary one and told we may have to change rooms the following day. We were able to keep the same room anyway.Our room was on the third floor. Very clean and bright with a balcony overlooking La Rambla. It was wonderful watching the world go by. The bathroom was excellent.Breakfast was all you would expect, croissants, fruit, cheese, ham, toast, yoghurts, fruit juice, tea, coffee. Cannot understand why people have complained in the past. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Would highly recommend as we thought we may be staying in the wrong place having read all the negative reviews.Excellent value for money - maybe some people just expect too much or thrive on complaining.............!!!!!!!!!

<Content>absolutely no complaints Having read some of the reviews, we were a bit weary about this hotel. It turned out to be an excellent base for our three night stop. What valuables we did have (passports, cash etc) was stored in the reception safe and always available. Staff were friendly enough, but the main attraction is this hotel's location right on the bustling las ramblas. If it's a quiet place you're after don't book here, but if it's a clean budget hotel right in the heart of things, we would absolutely recommend it.

<Content>Okay but once was enough We weren't robbed and our room was spotlessly clean although very small. There was no safe. The room included a sliding glass door which we could not lock but which wouldn't open more than 2 inches either. The staff were professional. friendly, and helpful. The ground floor has recently been modernized and looks lovely but smells like cat pee. The location is wonderful! We paid 75 euros per night and were given a continental breakfast on our first morning for free. The second morning we left at 6am, too early for such an amenity.

<Content>Worst Hotel Ever...... I Checked into Hotel thinking that it was really nice considering it was only 2 stars....well was i mistaken.....I Left the room for about 1 hour only to return and find my knapsack was gone....my knapsack carried a laptop, clothing, expensive makeup and sunglassed, cell phone chargers, memory cards for my camera....I felt very violated...This hotel has a policy to leave your ghetto old fashioned key at the front desk when ever your leave your hotel room....well the staff then takes your key and robs your room...this experience totally ruined my vacation and I would never ever go back to Barcelona or this hotel again......I already heard about all the purse snatchings but i never in a million years would think that someone would actually go in my room and rob me and to make matters worse it was an employee of the hotel...They were no help at all and they sat there and smirked the whole time I was crying and upset and trying to get to the bottom of what happened. They called the police and told me the police would not come...then i called the police on my own and they said the hotel staff told them not to come to me..but they made it there about 5 minutes after my phone call...(the police station is a block away from hotel)..If you want to keep your belongings and your rights do not stay at this hotel trust me....You will make a mistake of your life to trust these arogant people...The employees of the hotel were very rude...no help at all when it came to anything...PLUS they have a on site security guard that basically walked away when he heard my bag was gone...and was never seen again that day....what is the point of having security....They twisted the story to the police man....Then i asked them to check the cameras to see who walked out with my bag and the employees of the hotel said they need a permit to check the cameras and the only one who has the permit is the Owner...which the Owner does not live in Barcelona....How convienient is that??

<Content>Do not stay here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know that the problem of HOTEL THEFT was mentioned in a previous email, but I am going to go into a bit more detail. My family and I checked into the hotel in March for a few nights. We were told upon checking in that we should leave our key at the front desk whenever we left the hotel. They said this measure was to prevent us from losing it while out, but I soon realized it was their way of determining whether or not you were in your room. As soon as we checked in, we headed out for a quick lunch. An hour later, we returned to find our $2000 brand new laptop had been stolen right outof our locked room! The laptop bag also contained many other valuableitems, none of which would fit in the safe. We made the wrong assumption that it was safe to leave items in our hotel room. We immediately informed the staff. A young guy who worked at the front desk had a knowing smirk on his face the entire time, which lead us to believe that he was involved. When we checked in we walked up to our room and there was NO ONE anywhere around....so who else could have known we had a laptop in that particular room besides the hotel staff? The manager was being completely unhelpful and simply shruggedhis shoulders as if to say, these things happen. I asked him to call the police. He said there would be no point since they would notshow up anyway. I told him to call anyway. Once on the line, he told the police officer not to come in Spanish. He then put me on the lineand the officer, who spoke english well, told me that he was told NOTto come by the manager, but that he was going to come anyway. We spent the rest of our holiday filling out police reports and being treated like crap by the staff - they evidently did not like having afinger pointed at them by myself or the police, or decided that therewas no sign of forced entry into our room, and that a key had obviously been used. The worst part of all was that there was a videocamera pointed at the front door. The staff claimed that they were not able to access its contents - only the owner of the hotel could do that...and he conveniently did not live in Barcelona. I understandthat we will never get the laptop back, or all of the files and pictures of holidays that we had stored on it, but to have to worry about theft in your hotel room is just unacceptable. I have left more important items in hotels in third world countries without a problem. What does that say?

<Content>OK but book a premier room.. Just come back from a 2 night stay in Barcelona.. The hotel is well positioned in La Rambla and ok for a couple of nights..The hotel reception and premier rooms are very modern and ok, but venture to other parts of the hotel and it looks like a run down sea side guest house..Considering that they are trying to achieve an upgrade to a 3 star, I found the staff a little unfriendly at times..We booked what we thought was BB, but on paying it was added as an extra ( it was quite an nice continental breakfast though) so please check on arrival if its included.The only thing that really upset us was when we left, the hotel booked a taxi for us to the airport and we ended up paying 鈧?9 which was double that what we payed on the way to the hotel..all the other taxis we used also were very cheap when called from the street and quite accessable.. so we really didn't need to book..

<Content>Unimpressive This is a poor hotel. The reception area and the first 2 floors are beautiful. However should you venture above there, the hotel is of a very poor standard. We had booked a supreme room and were given a double. We complained about this and needless to say, the unhelpful reception staff did nothing for us.The room door was paper thin and I can understand how a previous reviewr had his room broken into. The security measures downstairs are appalling. The safety box is a clear plastic folder, with a Post-it note of your room number on it, kept at reception. When retrieving your key from reception or indeed, your folder no ID is asked for.There is a sex shop a couple of doors down and the surrounding area attracts a few unsavoury characters, however , the hotel is in a fairly good location. A minutes walk from the wax musuem, and only 5 minutes from the Columbus statue and the harbour.All in all, it is a poor hotel, the pictures provided don't really tell the true story. It would be ok as a last resort if you keep your wits about you, but I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

<Content>Excellent! After reading some of the horror stories in previous reviews I was dreading my stay at the Arc La Rambla however, I could never have been more surprised. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the very friendly staff in the elegant recently refurbished reception area. On check-in we were told that the standard rooms we had booked had been upgraded to superior rooms free of charge which was an added bonus! The rooms are basic but considering the hotel is 2* you get a TV, powershower and both the room and ensuite are both immaculately clean. I could not fault it. We had a small balcony looking out onto The Ramblas which was good for watching people go by. Even though we were right on the front the double glazed windows were just enough to keep the noise to a minimum. Yes it is true... there is a sex shop next door and a peep show next to that however we did not see or hear anything that we did not want to - it was all very discreet. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Port 'Vell' if you turn right out of the hotel and a 10 minute walk to Catalunya Square if you turn left out of the hotel were you can catch the Red  Blue line sightseeing tour buses (2 day ticket costs 23 euros and takes you to the likes of the Nou Camp, Sacred Family Church, Cathedral, beach etc etc) Breakfast is available at the hotel but to be honest there is more choice and better value out and about. Also if you like a drink then venture into the square behind the Ramblas as a glass of beer on the strip ranges between 7-10 euros whereas in the adjacent streets / square a beer only cost 3 euros. I would recommend 'Mikel Etxea' (midway up the ramblas on the left)for breakfast especially if Benito is working! Check out is at 12pm however if you are flying later in the afternoon there are lockers at the rear of the ground floor of the hotel for 2 euros were you can store your suitcases (two small or one large) until your flight. Shuttle bus to and from the airport is 3.80 Euros and you are picked up and dropped off in Catalunya square however there were four of us and it only cost 30 for a taxi which drops you right outside the hotel.If you want a very very reasonable hotel right in the centre of Barcelona then you will have to part with some of the creature comforts however, I thought the hotel was superb value for money and would recommend it to travellers coming to Barcelona for a short stay.

<Content>happily surprised Before staying at the hotel i read negative reviews, i was somewhat apprehensive ..however on arriving, the reception was modern and clean, the staff polite. I was impressed with the size of the room  bathroom and again, modern  clean. Admittedly we were staying at the back of the hotel and therefore didn't hear any noise. However, I would have loved a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony......your staying in a cosmopolitain city - I would expect noise and this would be a great way to watch the city go by. I felt secure in the hotel, you could leave valuables in the hotel safe. I didn't eat in the hotel so can not comment on the food. A kettle in the room for tea/coffee would have been handy. I would go back to stay, great location.

<Content>We had our things STOLEN in our room The hotel was aweful, the room door a joke. We had merely arrived and left the hotel room for only one hour to have diner. When we got back, somebody had broken into our room (307) and had stolen our camera, phone, mp3 player, among other things. AVOID THIS HOTEL, even if it is the last available room in the whole of Barcelona.

<Content>Good Budget Ok reading the reviews I had no idea what to expect but come on folks this is not a bad hotel. The entrance, smart polished marble, the reception staff I met were very helpful. The lifts worked and the room (the basic double) was clean and tidy although I have to say the bright avacado coloured bathroom suite took a bit of getting used to. It's plus and minus is it's central location. Near the bottom of the Ramblas and at the front as I was there was some noise. However double glazed double doors inside the shutters kept that down to a minimum. At the far end of reception, away from the entrance, a set of luggage lockers are provided which will fit a large suitcase for 2 euros. I think this is better than dumping the bags in a room which nobody supervises.

<Content>Incredible value and location Was concerned about some of the reviews I read but the room we were given was perfect with a balcony overlooking the Ramblas. The double glazing patio doors killed the sound from the street when closed. The air conditioning kept the room cool even though it was off during the day as the door card kills the power to the room when you remove it to leave the room.The taxies seem to charge what the like as the meter in the cab only reflect's half the cost of the fare as they charge all the extra'sfor each suitcase, airport levy, etc. Agree a price before departure. There is a bus to the Airport every 10 mins at the top of la Ramblas in Cataluna square which costs 鈧?.75 and takes about 40 minutes. The opentop bus tour is a must with tickets costing 鈧?8 for a day or 鈧?2 for 2 days. There are 3 bus routs Red,Green and Blue, all serving different tourst attractions and you can get off and on as often as you want.

<Content>Extremely Disappointed AVOID THIS HOTEL. My partner and I had booked 3 nights at this hotel over the internet. Upon our arrival we found that the hotel has an older section (not shown in photos) and that we had been allocated one of these rooms with two single beds, not the double that we had booked. After asking the staff to be changed to one of the rooms that we booked we were met with an attitude of indifference to our request. No solution was offered from the staff.As it was already evening, we relunctantly decided to spend the one night and find somewhere else to stay the following day. However, when we got to our room the whole floor had a power shortage. After returning from dinner we experienced another power shortage and I complained to the staff at reception only to experience their indifference once more.Some reviews suggest that the location is the best thing about this place, but it is in the sleazier part of La Rambla (strip clubs next door and a stream of bachelor parties out front). The hotel has a lovely reception area, but the quality does not extend to the rooms and staff. DO NOT STAY HERE

<Content>don't forget your earplugs I stayed a week at the hotel de l'arc and even if it looked ok the first day, it became a nightmare very fast.First I have to say that the hotel is partly renovated, but at least half of the room arent, and We were in one of them, so I can only give my advice on this type of room. But my guess is that if you get a cheap rate, you will be in this type of room.The hotel is VERY noisy. We were expecting it, having a room with a view directly on la Rambla (a famous boulevard for tourist, full of atraction night  day), but the worst is the noise inside the hotel, the phonic isolation is non-existent, you could clearly hear every move of the guests in the next room, or anything happening in the corridor. (bad luck, a baby and a couple of party-goers stayed at the same floor...)The breakfast is terrible, it's served in a very warm room, and you get some juices, bread, coffe, tea. nothing else. We even had perished cake one day, the best-before date was more than one month before!Of course for the price (8euros) it's a rip-off, but the worst is that they tried to make us pay by telling us only the 4th day in the week that it was not included, even though we booked with breakfast included. Every day before, the attendant asked us our room number and sayed nothing. I had to argue for some time to avoid paying.And then a few details that make it worse : The 2nd day, the A/C stopped working (it was 28掳C outside). at least it was fixed quickly.The 3rd day we discovered the bathroom was infested with ants.You like it or not, but there are horrible prostitute and a sex shop the door next to the hotel. and the neighbourhood is not very pleasant, we even saw a demonstration of the local people against drugs and insecurity in the neighbourhood.I will not return to this hotel, nor recomend it, at any rate.

<Content>1 Star Hotel With a Private Bathroom Hotel de L' Arc on La Rambla was not the worse hotel I've stayed at (that distinction is the Malibu Motel in Miami), but it was in the bottom 5. I had low expectaions but I am always looking for that hidden gem as another reviewer wrote. I paid 60 euro for 1 night before joining a cruiseship (which was a great cruise highly recommended area to travel), that rate I couldn't find anywhere other than bookings[--] (or maybe bookings[--]or something with a european suffix). First the good part; it did end up costing me 60 euro, it had a private bathroom in the room, it was on La Rambla and I got a balcony room overlooking La Rambla, I did not see any bugs, rodents, and it looked clean overall. Now the bad part, the bed was the creakiest bed I've ever had, intinacy was highly questionable and that sucked because I met my wife here after not seeing her for several months. The bathroom had no shower curtain (or shower curtain rod for that matter) I guess from dirtbags taking them home. The 13 TV had like 3 spanish channels, and was mounted on the wall in a good place to walk into and hit your head if you are above 5 7. No internet like the bookings website said. Small rooms, no ice, no fridge nothing really just a creaky bed in a small room with a private bathroom with a balcony overlooking La Rambla. I am amazed at the scale Europeans grade hotels, they are much less demanding than Americans. Hey for 60 euro's I wasn't that dissapointed, I got drunk out on the balcony and looked at the African hookers go through guys pockets after my wife and I got tired of seeing La Rambla. I got there at 8 pm and went out and I wasn't that impressed with La Rambla, I was hopeing for a Bourbon Street Spanish style, I saw a couple of human statues and a lady with a paralyzed cat that couldn't move, thats it. That and a bunch of Asian's selling a twirling magnetic disc thing that they'd catch, big deal. I'm gald I didn't make Barcelona my main vacation stop or I would have been really dissapointed. On the cruise my favorite place I saw and may return to was Cadiz, now that was a nice place! Hotel D L'Arc, a one star hotel with a private bath.

<Content>fine for the budget traveller My husband and I stayed there for one night last September, following our Mediterranean cruise. At the time,the hotel was going through renovations. We were in a room one flight up and it faced an alley so it was quiet. The room was out-dated and fairly clean. It was small and modest. I guess what can you expect for 65 euros? However, just before our cruise, we stayed at Hotel Splendid Apsis for 75 euros and it was really nice, large, modern and clean. So when I got to Hotel Arc, I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. However, the location is great. It's located right on the Ramblas and there's a lot of action happening here! I would think the rooms would be much improved since the renovations.

<Content>Great little hotel I just got back from a couple of days in this hotel. I had read the reviews and was a bit nervous about the place before I got there. The road it is on is wide and has a small market, it is a really good location - yes there is a sex shop a couple of doors down, and yes there are a very few very very ugly prostitutes in the street, but there was no problem. The road has lots of restaurants, some ARE pricey, Mickeys on the left of the hotel stung me for 120 Euros for 5 G+Ts and some tapas.The hotel is being modernised. I had a very nice room ( if you have an elecronic key I bet you are in a new room ) It was very clean, yes small but this is a budget hotel.Breakfast is basic.In conclusion, at the prices I think it is a steal - It is walking distance from the harbour, and really close to the metro.My room had aircon, wood floors and twin beds - it was a convention week for a very big show and I paid 110euros.As always I am happy to answer questions. I would stay there again. From the prev review, the choice of room seems critical.

<Content>Wot a dump! Reading the above reviews i can't believe i stayed at the same hotel. The smell of damp was unbelivable, i can still smell it on my clothes when i got home. Horrible grotty place. Our room was tiny. We had a twin but they were so close together it felt like we were sleeping the same bed! The floor looked clean but trust me my socks weren't, having walked around the room in them. The hairdryer in the bathroom was hanging by a single wire......dangerous was not the word for it. No shower curtain so showers meant a flooded bathroom. Horrible, grotty, smelly hotel. Stay here are your own risk!

<Content>Awsome Place To Stay For The Price My husband and I were there last month.Room: we stayed in two different CLEAN rooms. One had a terrace with no kind of view, but it was a pretty big room and the other had the view to the ramblas......that one was perfect. Service was also good. Location: It was walking distance from the clubs and also from the bars and main turistic area. The only thing is that if you are going with a family, you might not want to come back too late to your room because the strip/peek show places start opening. As a matter a fact, this hotel is located next to a peek show place, but is decent.....You do see some UGLY prostitutes, but none of them bother you and there is always a lot of cops around.....in my opinion, I did not feel scare in any way and WILL DEFINITELY STAY THERE AGAIN!!

<Content>Convenient and Pleasant The hotel is right on La Rambla, so it鈥檚 definitely very convenient for sightseeing, whether on foot or on the underground (but not for a car/taxi). Only the beach isn鈥檛 as near as they might want you to think. I would say it鈥檚 about a 20 minute walk.Despite its location, we heard no noise. I think we were in a newly renovated part of the hotel further back. The room and bathroom were both fairly large. The furnishing was boring but clearly new. It was clean, but housekeeping was inconsistent.Breakfast is not included but you can go to the caf茅 next door (but be careful not to be double-charged). But there are dozens of caf茅s/restaurants in the area so you can have any breakfast you want for less elsewhere.For some reason, the cleaning staff seemed set on saving toiletpaper, so we had to ask for more twice.Service was intermittent. Some were very friendly and helpful, but another one acted like she鈥檇 never heard anyone asking for a restaurant recommendation before.Overall, this was a pleasant and convenient place for a couple of days, but lacking service. I would recommend this place for budget travelers.One last note: AVOID the caf茅 on the strip directly outside this hotel. It鈥檚 not listed on the menu but they charge you $13 for each coke. I鈥檓 not kidding. Oh, and then they demanded a tip. Hah! In fact, stay off the strip for food/drinks.
