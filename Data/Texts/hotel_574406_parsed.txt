<Content>Not Really One of the previous reviewers seemed unsure how they felt about this hotel. That's me too! Some positives, it's new, it does have great harbour views on higher floors. Plenty of local life nearby - from local laundry (much cheaper than hotel service) to ex pat and local night club style bars and a7/11. The hotel's very small bar has a great character for a bar man (Randy, who is the only bit of atmosphere in this hotel). It also has to be said that the location is handy for all the main parts of Kowloon.Ask for a bath tub room, the one I had was positioned so you could take a bath and look out of the full length windows over Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.The negatives, the hotel is a bit on the noisy side, which is probably down to the design of the building. Limited public space, the hotel is tall but has a small foot print, which also gives a very disjointed design. None are real big problems, it鈥檚 just that overall, it is just not one of the many good and atmospheric Hong Kong hotels.If you are looking at the club or executive lounge packages then this is probably not for you. The lounge is totally lacking in any atmosphere and although you can use the bar on the floor below for inclusive drinks, on two of the nights I during my stay, the hot snacks, so much part of executive floor lounges, were out of action and when available where tired and unappetising. Given that the price difference for executive floor access between here and the close by Shangri La and Grand Stanford are not great, the Panorama is poor value and not in the same league.Would I stay here again? Probably not.

<Content>Nice new hotel Was a little apprehensive at first as this is the first time I am using Panorama Hotel and some of the recent reviews were not great. However, I am happy with my overall experience and will definitely consider using Panorama Hotel again for my next visit.Check-in was expedient. The counter staff were pleasant, efficient and very helpful. I had gone to them on several occasions and each time I found them to be very professional, courteous and very helpful.Room was modern and chic with LCD TV, nice black and white towels, sleeping robes and comfortable slippers. The house-keeping staff were pleasant and very efficient as well. I noticed my room was always clean up after breakfast which was nice.The location of the hotel is great, near many eateries, shops and next to both the MTR and railway line stations which made it very convenient. I only wish they vary their breakfast spread rather than offering the same spread everyday, that would have made the stay perfect.

<Content>Superb Stay If this is only the 50th best hotel in Hong Kong, then some of the finest hotel operators must have saved their best work for this tiny part of Chinese Territory.The Panorama is quite simply outstanding, The staff are almost falling over themeslves to assist, this includes saving you the sheer effort of selcting your floor whilst in the lift. The reception area ls large and spacious and the rooms, though not particulalry large are very well furnished. Location is great and for a special treat, eat in the hotel's resteraunt on the 38th floor. The food is excellent but the view is the special bit and is undoubedtly the best place to watch the daily light show in the evening.

<Content>Good Hotel is at good location to shops and foods. The hotel staff were fantastic, friendly, informative and helpful all the time. The room is very cosy but not very big, anyway that is the normal size of hotel in Hong Kong.The only weak point is the room lights are not bright enough to read at night.

<Content>Everything was wonderful minus the front desk staff From my room, there was a wonderful view of the hong kong skyline. This view was even more lovely at night. On the 40th storey of the hotel, there was even a gallery for guests to have an unblocked view of the harbour.The rooms were very classy. They were predominently black and white, with earthly tones, evoking feelings of being sophisticated without being too cold. Even the hotel freebies, like the mineral water bottles, and the slippers, were impressively designed. My favorited service staff were the doorman/conceirge team. They are the best I have ever encountered. Always helpful, always cheerful, and informative. It was a pleasure to see them everyday.My only qualm about this hotel is the TERRIBLE FRONT DESK STAFF in charge of checking in. My family's check in was delayed because of their inflexibility and general unhelpfulness that bordered on absurd. We had some complications as we did not book our rooms directly through the hotel, but through a online agent. Thus, some changes we made to our booking were not reflected in the hotel's computer system. Not only were the service staff unwilling to help us by making the changes in their system, they even referred us to the internet room and asked as to make our own changes and attempted to charge us for our computer usage. My interaction with the other front desk staff on other occasions also deepened my disappointment. They were unhelpful, unfriendly, and always very sullen looking (as mentioned before by another traveladvisor user)On a whole, the hotel is clean, classy and good-for-value, despite the occasional hiccups.

<Content>Room ready only at 10.30PM !!! I have been to HK for personal and business trips and stayed at places from YWCA to Conrad ... but nothing beats this atrocious experience at Panorama TST.-- Sorry, your room is only ready at 10.30pm!! Our family of 8 (with 2 young kids) arrived at the hotel at 8.30pm and greeted by sullen-looking staff at the front desk. The lobby was quiet with only us doing our check-in ... nonetheless we had to wait for a almost 15mins or so. Throughout .. there was no smiles nor eye-contact from the staff. Unique service we thought..The real horror then came when she passed us the key cards and said sorry, one of the rooms will only be ready at 10.30PM. The earlier guest has paid for extended use of the room. SHOCK Horror!!She then further defended by saying that it's because we have rqeuested for all room on the same floor therefore ... We then asked for alternatives, but she came back saying the hotel is fully-booked so we had to wait. We were then told that hotel has upgraded us to the Platinum rooms on higher floors .. but that didnt help that we have to wait till 10.30pm! There was no offer of compensation nor any form of sincere apologies (for the inconvenience caused to us ) extended to us at all. The kids were tired and hungry... we were really displeased at the level of service. .. but what can we do but wait.We asked to meet the duty manager when we check-in again at 10.30pm. This was equally disappointing. He was not forthcoming on offering any form of apologies. Upon our asking, he offered 'free late checkout' which we declined as we have an early flight to catch. Finally, he offered a 10% rate reduction for the night. When asked (by me) if he viewed this as a fair compensation for guests made to wait and check in at 10.30pm ... he rebutted by asking what form of compensation are we looking for. We were appalled by his attitude and was totally disappointed. He then offered another 10% off. .. By then, we have already made up our minds that we will never return to this hotel ever. No service, no professionalism at all.To be fair, the hotel does have its good points - great location, breath-taking view of the harbour (from high floors), superb housekeeping team and friendly concierge team. But will we return to this hotel? .. No.

<Content>Ok hotel We reserved a platinum room and was upgraded to a suite on the 32nd floor. The room was very big - seperate living room, and huge closet.The view from our room was great. We had a very clear view of Victoria Harbor.The one thing that was negative is the restaurant for breakfast. The food available for breakfast was the same every single day and service was ok at best.

<Content>hote too small The hotel location is not bad, though most buildings in the area are quite old, the view is good on the high levels but on the lower level you see a lot of old buildings that need to be renovated. The room shape is long and skinny, to maximize view i think, it makes the room really crowded and you can not walk pass the desk if someone is sitting in it.

<Content>Mixed feelings I have mixed feelings about this hotel. There are some very good points about it, like the view of Hong Kong Harbour, but there are also some annoying qualities, mainly related to design.The hotel has a sleek, modern architecture, which is in sharp contrast to the off-the-beaten path neighborhood in which it is located. The lobby is located one floor up from street level, which gives you something of an immediate respite from the roar of Hong Kong. The hotel has a small footprint, but it goes up, up, up. The elevators seem capable of handling the hotel's traffic; there was only one morning where I had a significant wait for an elevator. Despite the vertical rise, I found this hotel to have an intermittent noise problem. A sound something like a vacuum cleaner would cycle on and off even through the night. My room was very narrow. So narrow, in fact, that I couldn't comfortably sit at the desk to work at my computer because the foot of the bed came so close it did not allow me to pull the desk chair out far enough. I found it easier to sit on the end of the bed to work on the desk. I found the shower also very small. There was no room for a tub. The design seemed to attach maximum priority to giving as many rooms as possible a harbour view.I noted my concerns in the hotel's checkout questionnaire and received an immediate response from the hotel's management. They noted that they do have larger rooms. In that I was staying in one of their platinum rooms I wonder if I would have needed to stay in a suite to get more space?The staff in the hotel were inconsistent. Some, like the concierge, were extraordinarily helpful. Others, in the restaurant or behind the front desk, were decidedly unhelpful, even sullen.The quality of the food in the restaurants is very good. The breakfast buffet selection is somewhat limited, but adequate.Bottom line, I think the Panorama needs to try a little harder, compensating for the built-in design problems, the location and the highly competitive nature of the Hong Kong hotel market. It also needs to correct the noise problem and work with the staff more. If it did all these, I think it would be on par with other Hong Kong hotels.

<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent location. We were in HK for a 3-night stopover en route from Taipei to London and chose the Panorama based on its location and price, and what an excellent choice it proved to be! It is easily accessible from the Airport Express train station at Kowloon by the free K3 bus (every 12 minutes), which drops off at the front door. Located in a quiet side street but within 100 metres of an entrance to the MRT there were numerous bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk .The hotel staff were extremely helpful and all spoke good english. We had a room on the 27th floor with lovely views across the harbour. There seem to be only 12 or so rooms per floor and I think it may be wise to choose one away from the lift, if possible - although apart from the occasional door closing we didn't hear any noise at all, and being high up there was virtually no traffic noise.The room was not large, but had everything needed - including a large flat screen TV, ADSL connection (free), i-Pod dock, quiet fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. The shower-only en suite was again not large, but perfectly adequate. On our second night, I noticed the extractor fan was not working, and thought I would report it when we checked out. However, the room attendant must have noticed because the next evening when we returned from our sightseeing, it had been fixed.The restaurant in the hotel struck us as being expensive, but with so many options nearby, that wasn't a problem!All in all a place to be highly recommended.

<Content>average the stay in the hotel was something i would like to share with all the people who are considering this as an option for thier next stay in the region . the room we took was on the gold floor got it upgarded from a slver room that comes with the package , the price of upgradation didnt include all the basic top ups a hotel which is five star would give for the guests staying in such a category of room. Although the staff at the reception was extremely helpful but the same cant be said for tthe rest of the staff and their eloquency in english , me being an indian faced a lot of problems to understand the lingual they were using for english .The location of the hotel is great and the room that i could manage to get had an excellent view , the size of the room was very small though . I was staying with my daughter in that way the hotel had zero amenities as mine was primarily a sight seeing trip didnt had much time to spend in the hotel but in had it been the other case i could have been in a soup as no child care centre and the baby sitting facility is way to over priced at 750 hong kong dollars for three hours.I coul not manage to have something from the in room dining as was over priced and me being a vegetarian had lil choice , how ever i mangaed dinner from nearby indain resturants which are a plenty.ALso in case you take apackage from the travel agent then dont pay for the half day tour of hong kong thats sheer wastage . decide upon your trips on the airport or once reaching there .

<Content>a gem of a hotel! we had missed our flight out of hong kong and we did not know where we should overnight--with a baby! the concierge service in the hong kong airport recommended this hotel. tired and very very exasperated we did not have very high expectations. however our spirits rose upon arrival to a very prompt and courteous reception. the room had plush plush carpet. the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in! the attention to detail made the stay very pleasurable. i highly recommend this hotel. the only drawback was that our room smelled of smoke. we were told that it was a non-smoking room. should we ever go back to hong kong we would stay at this hotel.

<Content>Good functional Hotel - Good staff My partner and I stayed here for four nights. We booked the hotel over the hotel website and paid at the same time.When we checked in they said our room wasn't paid for however, I had my receipt and credit card statement handy to show them that I had infact paid for it. They felt so embarrased that they up graded us which was a very nice gesture. The only problem was they upgraded us to a higher floor but a smaller corner room - it was so small that we couldn't hardly move in there and the facilities were not what they say on the website. We had already taken a higher quality room so if this was the upgrade to the highest quality room I would be sadly dissapointed if I paid for it!Anyways, the hotel itself is clean and functional and the people were very lovely however we had problems with the in-room internet which wasn't their fault and unlike most hotels of this calibre in other asian countries, there is no free wireless inroom which was a bit of a shock. Nonetheless, I noted it on the feedback card and the few issues we experienced - I recieved an email from the hotel manager apologising for the inconvenience and the offer of a room upgrade and free broadband internet next time I come back. This is fairly impressive and shows they do take note of what the guests are saying.All in all, it is one of the better hotel expereinces I have had in Hong Kong!

<Content>The best hotel in Kowloon NEWHARBOUR VIEWCHEAP PRICEGOOD SERVICENEW - I think it is one of the newest hotel in Kowloon. Most of the hotel in TST is old and ugly but Panorama just open for few months and it is very tall ( 40 floor?!). HARBOUR VIEW - they have great harbour view room and you can see the firework and laser show. I stayed in this hotel for 4 times - 16F, 22F, 35F  37F / different direction - i can have harbour view room everytimes. The receptionist told me that 70% of the room got the harbour view - it is amazingCHEAP PRICE - it is very reasonable price. Compare with another five star hotel, the room size is aboout 5-10 square meter smaller but it is about 40-50% cheaper than other 5 star hotel in kowloon. ( i think it is 4-5star hotel but 5 star service). MUST choose platinum floor - only HKD$3-500 different but much better view + more benefits you can receiveGOOD SERVICE - I chose this hotel because I know it is the sister hotel of Hotel LKF in Central. Hotel LKF is the famous hotel which provide excellent personal service and it has been already recommended by many friend of me. Hotel Panorama can provide the excellent personal service as Hotel LKF does. They have internation staff from Korea, Russia, India, America, Australia and etc.I have already recommended this hotel for my friends and colleagues. All of them did have the excellent stay there and NO Complaint can give.

<Content>Modern hotel with amenities and service I have stayed in probably 20 different hotels in Hong Kong. The Panorama by Rhombus is definitely one of the top 3. I got a great promotional rate as the building was still partly under construction, just under $100USD/nt. We were also upgraded to a Club Room which had incredible views of the Hong Kong skyline and was quite spacious by Hong Kong standards. The room was very modern, with iPod docking station (not iPhone compatible though), the obligatory flat-panel TV, soft bed, and a beautiful bathroom that faced the harbor. Other amenities include a rooftop area with ping pong table for great evening views and a good location in east Tsim Sha Tui. Service was fast and courteous as well. Would definitely recommend.

<Content>Lovely hotel with good location.. Stayed here for 3nights, took a deluxe gold room. We were given a room on the 28th floor, the view of the harbour was nice except that there were some old buildings in front of the harbour that kinda ruin the overall view. Room was pretty small, but gorgeous with mirrors around which makes the room seems bigger. Bed was very very comfortable, we love it. Bathroom is anyway, averagely small. We had complimentary breakfast during our stay there, on the 38th floor, Santa Lucia restaurant, breakfast was pretty good, offering both western and chinese cuisine. We were able to enjoy a better view of the harbour during breakfast on the 38th floor. The last night of our stay there, we were given some cookies and milk before bed, did not try them though as we were exhausted from the day. This hotel is very close to the Tsim Sha Tsui station (Tsuen Wan line), about 2mins walk, which makes the transportation very easy for us. Would definitely stay here again. We do recommend to reserve your room on the high floors (gold floor and above) if you would prefer to have a nice harbour view during your stay

<Content>My best experience in a long time I wanna say, great job. I checked in late at 6pm and i was warmly greeted on the ground floor. Brought me up to lobby for checking in, great service from the receptionist. Speedy fast service, explained to me everything i need to know without me having to ask for anything back. Thats the first i ever encountercos i travel to hk really a lot, so i've had many experiences in different hotels. Very nice hotel room, given to me as wat i've requested when i booked through hotel website online. Very good room cleaning attendance. When i checked out, it was a speedy and service oriented one, no hassle. everytime i walked out the main door, i was greeted with a smile and opened door. Even during breakfast, i was warmly greeted no matter how busy the cafe was. For the room, i love the black and white theme. The air is good, no defects on the furnitures, toiletries were well arranged. Being young and lazy to dress up, many people take me as a bypass or 'not worth the service' kinda guy, i hardly get such good services. I travel alot for business especially HK, i'll definitely come back again. I'll recommend to my friends, workers and business partners if they were to be in HK. Keep up the good work.

<Content>Excellent Kowloon Hotel We stayed for 9 nights in Panorama Hotel in June 2008. We paid 拢64 per night for a ROH room booked through wired.com; slight problems when checking in as booking had not been transmitted to hotel correctly and our request for a double bed had not been made. Reception said they would upgrade us because we were staying for such a long time and also to accommodate the requirement for a double bed. We ended up on a Gold standard floor in room 2303. Room was not overly large, but then again this is Hong Kong and for 拢64 a night was a bargain. The view over the harbour was excellent from the room; better still from the roof gardens and the restaurant on the 40th and 38th floor respectively. Hotel is spotlessly clean, bed/pillows/quilt were comfortable, Bathroom was like the Tardis! - small and shower only but clever design and mirrors made it seem much larger than it really was, and it was perfecltly adequate. Plenty of storage, decent hairdryer and toiletries supplied.We felt very secure when we realised that the room key cards had to be used to operate the lift, and only allowed access to areas that we should have been in , i.e. our own floor and restaurant and roof garden floors. Presumably they also monitor when you are out of the rooms (the card has to be inserted in the usual slot thing for the lighting within the room to work) because the room was always made up within a very short time of us leaving it, no matter how late in that day that was. Location of hotel is excellent. Plenty of bars and restaurants and shops within 2 minutes walk, ditto MRT. Not far to stroll down to the ferry pier either, but strolling anywhere is a bit hot and sticky (and sometimes decidedly damp!) in June in Hong Kong.Hotel restaurant was excellent. Not overly cheap, but not bad at all for fine dining, and a wonderful view. Very attentive service, and the food and wine were excellent. Cafe was similary good. Room service was excellent, when placing an order they said it would be with us in 15 minutes and every time they were wrong - it was more like 5 minutes!!Very minor gripes - hotel's own website says that there is an espresso machine in all Gold and Platimum rooms - when we queried the absence of same in our room, we were told that the machines are in suites only. And the bedtime cookies and milk as advertised on the website were conspicuous by their absence ( but whoever wants milk and cookies at bedtime in Hong Kong anyway??). But there is a mini bar in the room and tea and coffee making facilities too, and the 7 to 11 store is just along the road so you can stock up on fresh juice, beer etc etc if you don't want to pay hotel mini bar prices.. And one of the bathrobes kept disappearing. If you are fussed about keeping both bathrobes during your stay, then keep them in the wardrobe!Overall an excellent experience and would highly recommend staying at this hotel. If you want a good view, you will likely need to book to be on a Gold floor ( from I think floor 17 - 27,Platinum floors are highter still) because there are tall buildings in front of the hotel.

<Content>TERRIBLE Front Desk Service!!!! We check in at 5pm but with no rooms available and had to wait till 6+pm till they managed to provide us an upgrade which was a common practice across the industry (so nothing excellent to comment) but front desk staff Eileen's attitude was terrible on both check in and check out occasions.She was very impatient in explaining the payment, very rude and unprofessional and doesnt seem to know what to do. She is the WORST hotel staff I ever saw WORLDWIDE! While hotel location is great, room is clean and reasonable for a 3 star hotel in hong kong and food is great, its a plus point, but we would think twice whether to stay in Panorama on our future trips as this kind of service standard provided by Eileen should never be accepted and compromised.

Excellent location in Tsim Sha Tsui and central for getting everywhere by MTR.We stayed in a harbour facing suite.Hotel itself was clean and well decorated but facilities such as the gym were not yet available - fully booked and just to warn I'd heard they were so busy that they'd had to transfer some guests to a sister hotel.Didn't eat in hotel restaurants mainly because the room service food was very mediocre and didn't reflect the price; bearing in mind how cheaply it is to eat outside.Roof terrace smallish but has great views.Overall not cheap; but for location, view and top notch service - especially Stephen on concierge - they go out of their way to make your stay special - you can't go wrong.

<Content>Lovely Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in March. The hotel is in a fantastic location, 2 mins from the subway and a few mins walk to the various shops etc. Nathan Rd is about 15 mins walk. The hotel was immaculate, staff were great, giving us an early check in to our room after a long haul flight.Would def. recommend this hotel to someone who is looking to get the most out of a short stay in HK. Staying in Kowloon is much better than on the island itself. Would recommend doing The Peak, Lantau Island and def a trip to Stanley - make sure you take the double decker buses - fab view.Enjoy!

<Content>Flawless service  Stayed her in December 2007, just after Christmas  the property was in its soft opening phase. The location is great beside a Metro station on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong. The entire property including the 25th floor roof terrace is constructed with the highest quality materials and although it has the look of an office Tower Block, when you arrive into your bedroom, you will not be dissappointed with the technology, the facilities or the view. The Hotel has limited restaurant  bar space, but all of Hong Kong is on the doorstep with all the amazing variety of restaurants  food products you would expect. The location is excellent  is just a 2 minute walk from the world famous Peninsula Hotel. Give this Hotel a few more months  this will be thee place to stay on this side of the River!

<Content>Nice Stay at Hotel Panorama We stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Panorama. This is a brand new hotel, the location is excellent and is located across a mini-square from Kowloon Shangri-La, with the subway station a few steps away. As with other reviewers, it takes a while to actually walk underground to get to the actual subway cars, but it is better to walk underground where it is airconditioned, than above ground where it is not. Some of our friends told us to stay on the Kowloon side, but next time, I would prefer to stay on the HK Island side. As for the hotel, it was a HUGE room, with 2 double beds, chair, desk and armchair. Nice duvets, ok toiletries, nice bathroom. The view wasn't great but we weren't in our room very much, and we knew that going in. The only downside to this hotel was lack of gym/fitness center. That would have made it 5 Stars!We had great service, and the 2 times we called housekeeping, someone was at our room in a matter of minutes, delivering extra towels, etc. The MOST HELPFUL person was Andreas (I don't know if I am spelling his name correctly?) who was the business center manager. My husband had ordered some suits from a tailor and wanted to make sure that his suits were 4 buttons and not 3 buttons. We weren't sure how to go about calling to make sure, so we went down to the front desk to inquire. Andreas saw us looking lost in the lobby and asked if he could help. We told him our problem and immediately, he took out his personal cell phone and placed our call for us! When there was no response at the shop number, he dialed the tailor's cell phone as well, again on his own cell phone. Everyone we encountered was polite and helpful but I never had a manager make calls on his own cell phone for a hotel guest. Thank you very much for making our stay so pleasant!!

<Content>Amazing Service! Hotel Panorama was nothing like any of the hotels I have ever stayed in - and my husband and I do out fair share of 5 star hotels  restaurants!The private check-in was brilliant and the room was amazing, with almost a 180 degree view of the harbour. We were staying on the club floor (highly recommend this). Breakfast was delicious and we were able to drop in any time of the day for snacks, drinks, coffee and tea. We had free cocktails and canapes pre dinner and the restaurant - Santa Lucia restaurant was spectacular!On the first night of dining, the head chef came out during our main meals to see whether we were enjoying out meals (which we were). After a short conversation and we told him we would be back the following day, he offered to make up a menu for us. I had never had this sort of service anywhere in the world. It was so special and both my husband and i were touched by his offer. Ofcourse, we returned the next night and did not want to trouble the chef, so we took a look at the menus to decide what we wanted to eat. Before we knew it, the chef was in the dining room, telling us to back away slowly from the menus. We were thrilled that he remembered and he knew we had arrived. He made up a 5 course meal for us, all of which was brilliantly put together with balanced flavours and cooked to perfection.Apart from the restaurant, the hotel had all the small things covered. As we didn't have our own laptop, there was a business centre which was free to use for us. All the smaller details that made our stay so special was all covered.Thank you for making our stat so special. Never have we received this sort of service - service from people who truly seemed to care. I almost felt like I was in someone's house and they were doing all they could to make my stay enjoyable.

<Content>Interesting alternative in Hong Kong As a frequent guest of the Holiday Inn Golden Mile, I noticed that Rhombus opened another hotel, this time in TST, HKG. I have stayed at the LKF by Rhombus and found it a great experience. So this time, I choose the Panorama, over my usual choice of the HI as it is just a stonethrow and convenient to the office of our business partner in TST.We had asked for Platinum as that would give us access to the lounge for B'fast and cocktails as well as free wireless in the lounge. I ended up on the 36th floor and had a corner room with good views over the harbor. The hotel is new and clean. Had a busy feeling in the lobby and public areas with tourists and tour groups. If on business, I would recommend the Platinum option. You will have a separate elevator and you are away from the crowd. Breakfast is not lavish but acceptable, with good coffee. The views from the lounge are stunning. Staff is helpful and friendly. The only disappointment was the bathroom. It had no separate shower and the whole bathroom is very small. I was told next time to ask for a middle room as they have separate showers.The hotel lies next to the Hyatt Regency which is under construction and around the corner there are plenty of friendly bars and restaurants.A short walk from Nathan Road and other shopping streets, this is a great new alternative. I will be back again.

<Content>Nightmare in Hotel Panorama by Rhombus We stayed for 3 days/2nights to attend a trade fair. Upon check in, we were given a room on the smoking floor (we were not advised about this). Since we didn't smoke, we asked to be transfered since the room smelled of cigarette smoke. We were transferred to a room with an awful smell (like somebody threw up) and it became worse the longer you stayed. We were given a room spray that did not help much. We had to sleep in that room since the hotel said that it was fully booked. The following morning, we talked to the manager and was told the matter would be resolved. When we returned to our room at night, the smell was worse. We asked to be transferred and we were transferred to a room on a higher floor. However, the mini bar refrigerator didn't work. The next day, we talked to the manager and asked for a refund or some arrangement to compensate for what happened during our stay. The manager REFUSED saying the hotel addressed the situation by giving us a room on a higher floor (supposedly an upgrade) but perhaps it was the only available room at that time. The hotel seems not to have adequate quality controls. We felt that the hotel was indifferent to our feelings and is definitely not guest-friendly.

<Content>Lovely hotel with wonderful staff Very nice hotel, beautifully appointed. Linens were particularly nice. Staff very nice and helpful. Room was a bit small and looked out on an alley. Also, we booked specifically because they had an exercise room and internet access. However, the exercise room has not yet been built, and internet access is not available at the TripAdvisor rate.Very convenient location right next to the metro. FYI, the hotel is now on the airport express shuttle route. Would definltey stay there again.

<Content>Not up to expectations Booked a premium platinum room with club privleges. Room was fantastic with a great view of Victoria Harbour. Staff very helpful and in room check in is a nice touch.The negatives were - no hors deourvs with evening drinks as listed on the hotel website. This is one of the benefits of the club lounge. We were offered a snack menu but had to pay extra for this.Also turn down service did not include any extras as listed in previous reviews. No refreshments.Afternoon tea was disappointing as it was cookies that were left in the lounge all day. No extras brought out at 3pm as listed. Very good coffee though.

<Content>Hotel Panorama Experience We were a big group of 15 people and stayed in silver and gold rooms for 4 nights 5 days 14 Nov - 18 Nov. I must say that the staff were very kind and helpful! Every question we had they were able to answer right away, they seemed knowledgeable and easy to communicate with, despite the accent hurdle that we usually experience in HK. The hotel had a modern feel to it, rooms were just the right size and the double beds were big. The corner rooms had bayviews in the bathroom and was very relaxing. Housekeeping went the extra mile and would organize our rooms in the morning, not just cleaning up! Every night turn down service was excellent as well. Location wise it is near nathan road and walking distance to Ocean Terminal. Beside the hotel street is also an MTR entrance! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely like to come back. I just regret not being able to save pictures of the rooms before my camera memory stick went crazy :(
