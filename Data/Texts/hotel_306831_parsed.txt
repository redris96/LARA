<Content>Comfortable hotel We booked this hotel as a package with our flights, and used it as our base for odd nights in between other trips we had planned around Bali and Komodo.On arrival we upgraded to a very pleasant poolside club room, with the bathroom in the small private garden - very different! The hotel and grounds were spotlessly clean and tidy, the bed was very comfy and the staff friendly and helpful. Room service food was very good, the massage in the Spa was above average and all in all it proved to be a comfortable stay. This hotel is not in the most amazing location in Bali, but it is very comfortable and easy to get to everywhere from it.

<Content>A disappointment My partner  I have just returned from an 18 day holiday in beautiful Bali. Unfortunately we chose to stay at this hotel.It is not a family hotel, but caters mostly for corporate guests. Our accommodation was in a newly renovated deluxe room with private courtyard. Not sure where the private courtyard comes in , anyone on the upper floors were able to look over the balcony!! and not sure either where the newly renovated room comes from. The semi outdoor bathroom with Bali bathtub had a pull out shower from the bath  had to be hand held whilst showering or else stand on it while washing and then rinse off. The 3 restaurants were deserted almost every evening no atmosphere whatsoever. The hotel could do with employing a good maintenance manager. The hotel is located too far away from the shops and restaurants so taxis were a necessity every evening. The buffet breakfast became rather boring in the end . The food was usually cold. The shuttle bus to the beach was fine but the towels provided for the patrons were not always clean. I did complain to the assistant manager but noticed days afterwards patrons still returning their unsatisfactory towels to the beach boy. The hotel pool well ok but no hand rail was provided for entry or exit of the pool just as I call them big bali steps One particular evening on exiting one of the lifts (the other was out of order all the time we were there) about 15 non european business persons were eating in the lobby what appeared to be take-aways. When we returned approx 3 hours later their take-away litter was still in situ. We could see it was once a majestic hotel but now very very tired. We had a great holiday but would not be staying here again.

<Content>Not Bad at all We were very apprehensive about this hotel after reading the reviews. But were positively influenced after reaching there. First the negatives. They put us on 4th floor at the far end of the hotel. there is only one elevator up. so it was a long walk each time ... or one has to take stairs to go from pool to the room. The staff was not well informed at to what our entitlement in our booking was , what were the current specials at the hotel etc. conflicting info. So please make sure you have your travel agent / reception write down your free extras like breakfast, internet usage, discounts. Good points.. If you book a club room , there is a free happy hour from 5 to 6 p.m with unlimited alcoholic drinks. the snacks not so great. They also have a camp splash for kids and free scuba diving lesson if you book in advance. Room although small was very clean and well maintained. Totally renovated I think. They give all amenities of a four star hotel. The food in Cafe Komodo is quite good and so is Room service. The Sanur Harum chinese for Dinner a la carte is a complete NO NO. Very bad , tasteless food, apparently they have good dim sum , but I did not try. The hotel has a shuttle but it does a 5 min. ride to the beach in like 30 mins so if you have the time to spare use it. Else it costs about 10,000 - 12000 RP to the Sanur restaurant area. Make sure u take Bluebird taxi cause the other one took us for a long ride and the bill was 27,000 Rp for the same distance. CAFE Batur Jimbara is a good option for food and coffee, we went there twice.. always busy.. Bonsai beach was also okay. For HOTEL to airport , I would recomm. using hotel , as with bluebird we also paid about 79,000 RP and hotel rate is 80,000. I dont know if hotel tags on tax and service on top of this. Taxi to KUTA from Hotel is about 60,000. Taxi to Jimbaran is about 70,000 Rp. Taxi to Nusa Dua is about 103,000. all Bluebird that we took. Hotel also has shuttle to kuta at Rp 10,000 per person. Dont miss sthe Dinner at JIMbaran very good view and restaurants..most of them offer free transport plus disc on food , we did not know so took a taxi back and forth.

<Content>Our secret.... I have wondered over writing this for sometime - as my husband and myself love this place so much. It is a fanyastic hotel, beautiful staff and reasonably quiet . So if you are the traveller whom wishes a relaxing trip , this is the place. Do as much or as little as you wish and only a cheap 20min taxi to Kuta for the inevitable shopping trip. 5kms from Ubud. 35mins from Jimbaran Bay.We have stayed here at least 6 times and never been disappointed, but as i say we love to relax. We chill out reading by the pool, drinks in hand of course! We walk,  talk when we please to as many or as little people as we wish.Eating whether by pool ,restaurants inside or outside hotel ( 1. the in hotel - chinese- is fantastic) or room service - i have never seen my husband eat so much!! We love good food and drinks.We enjoy the various rooms , especially the deluxe with open air bathroom / private court yard ,( we booked that at a smashing 70 u.s. a night incl b'fast) walk out to meandering poolside etc. We have such a great time we have taken two sets of friends at different times. Normally we holiday April . May or Sept . / Oct . and have had good weather, and would you believe it not too many people around!!Each pm a couple play guitar and sing , we often spend time with drinks and enjoy their patter in the hotel lobby !  I am off again with another friend in July 08. Some may say boring !!! But why waste time , effort and perhaps be disappointed? We get there , it's home from home for us and its safe - I have no problem if I had to travel on my own,Hope you find a destination / hotel that you enjoy . Yhis is the one for us .

<Content>Great deal Found a great 4nts package on their website. Hotel was very nice with great landscape pool and gardens. Breakfast very extended. Location was good, few minutes walk to seaside. Free shuttle to beach. Rooms were very clean, bathroom old but still adequate. Good bed. Fitness was free and very professional. Massage cheaper across the road. Overall good stay although the beaches in Sanur are not nice compared with what we saw on our trip along West Australia. We did a cycle trip of the volcano which was great and hired a taxi for 6 hours to do excursions. Sanur beach hotel has best location for price but can't compare size and maintance of rooms.

<Content>Good hotel, poor location Lovely hotel, horrid location. I checked out the Paradise apartments 鈥?even worse. The pool area and grounds in my hotel were very nice indeed.This was basically a business hotel aimed at the Asian market, there were NO facilities for holiday makers, despite there being advertised as such. I was put on the 4th floor, top floor despite requesting a low level room, no balcony, so I had to upgrade and pay extra for a pool side room. The room was good, the breakfasts very good. I never saw anyone having dinner in the hotel. In fact I wasn鈥檛 even sure the restaurants were open.The hotel was just off a very busy main road, with just a couple of local bars/restaurants and a few small supermarket type shops. The area was not safe to walk around at night, poor lighting and very large holes in road/pavement, piles of rubbish everywhere. This was not a tourist area. The shuttle bus to the tourist area took 陆 hr each way and finished at 6.30pm. I would definitely not stay there again. However, if you were organising a conference I would highly recommend the facilities at this hotel.

<Content>Good Value for Money We just came back from a trip to SPH, the hotel is good value for money as the price is cheap and the amenities are OK. Sanur is great if you want to avoid the hassle of commercial Kuta or touristy nusa dua (expensive too), you can chill out at the pool and sip a cocktail made by inviting and ever-smiling attendants.Mosquitos can be a problem at night but i would recommend you inform the reception right after you leave the room during evening to spray it before you go back at night and problem is solved. The hotel needs some general upgrade which exlains the price tag of rooms. Be sure to ask if the room assigned to you is Refurbished because there are others that are not..have confirmation in writing i guess. We paid about 60$ for room with breakfast. The hotel is NOT on the beach but a free shuttle runs to it every 1/2 hr , not the best of beaches though.Try massage at COZY , 7min near Hotel and cheap ...2people massaging you for 10$ for 2hrs if i remeber right.Enjoy

<Content>Too many mosquitos! I stayed at the Sanur Paradize Plaza for one night as part of a conference package. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff was friendly enough. My bathroom (toilet and bath) was outside, although if that bothers you I think that there were some rooms with inside bathrooms. I had lunch at the Brasserie restaurant, and it was decent. The hotel is not on the beach, though it is close to Sanur area beaches. It's about 20 minutes by car to get to the Kuta/Seminyak area. The price of the hotel was included in the conference package, so I can't speak to the value. It is more of a leisure hotel than for business - the wireless internet in the room did not work (although the hotel guide said there was dial up available...), and the business center was not always staffed. My only real complaint is that there was a massive mosquito problem in the room. I woke up with at least 15 bites. There were no coils or electrical deterrants in the room, so I would suggesting asking for some. Or, bring some repellent and douse yourself before bed!

<Content>Loved our stay ! We stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks during Sept 2006 we had another couple with us and we all really enjoyed our stay here, the staff and service was great and eveyone of us said that we would stay there again. We booked the basic rooms and when we got there we paid to upgrade to the courtyard rooms which are very nice, the lay out of the pool is great and you geta little deck area with chairs to sit and relax in the evenings with the view of the pool, the upgrade cost next to nothing .....when you are there they charge you less than the internet rates.They had a gym that we foun to be good enough for being on a trip and the breakfast was always good .....a great place to stay !

<Content>We just had a great staying! We stayed in the hotel for the periode of 2006.04.14 until 2006.04.30. Some people let us doubt for choosing this hotel, because:. not situated directly on the coast. no windows can be opened (in the not superior rooms), there is no balcony. rooms are close to each other (like a 'chicken battery').(we stayed in room 351third floor, at the end of the corridor)None of these disadvantages seemd a problem for us, because:. hotel is not situated directly on the coast indeed, but only a couple of hundred meters away. It is only five minutes walking, and you dont have the disadvantage of noise,.. of the coast activities. windows cannot be opened, but the airco is excellent. We have to admit that we nearly never stay in the hotel during our stating, a hotel is just for sleeping and the use of the bathroom. Why using a balcony when you have an excellent garden and enough place to sit and ly down near the extremely long swimming pool?? . we only once had ten minutes problem with the bad accoustic between rooms, when, the second night after arrival, a couple of Chinese people arrived in their room at 02.00 AM, and made a lot of noise busting doors, shouting at each other,.. I knocked on their door, and the noise stopped immediately.The staff was very friendly, we had a couple of nice attentions (fruit at arrival, a nice peace of pastry the day before we left, with a poem for my wife (was the manager mr. Bell trying to pick off my lovely wife? ;-) ).Just had a great time!Paul BraemBruges-Belgium

<Content>good value Hotel is located on the quiet side of Sanur. It would rate a 3.5 just under a 4 star. Rooms are comfy and very clean. Bathrooms are a bit dated and need renovation. Staff are great and very helpful. For the price this hotel is great. If you don鈥檛 like catch lots of taxis or like lots of night life then this is not the place to say.

<Content>Paradise Plaza Hotel Hotel was lovely, but it was out of the way from the beach and Sanur town. There was nothing around to do round about. Apart from the Hotel restaurant there were only 4 small tavernas - best one was the CorridorBali was quite a disappointment, doubt I will be going back

<Content>Good option for affordable luxury beach hotel in Bali We stayed at this hotel in February 2005. It has some definite pros and cons. The cons: it's not directly on the beach, so it doesn't have any big views or direct beach access (the hotel is oriented around a nice inner courtyard/pool area). Rooms were on the small side. The Plaza is an older luxury hotel so it doesn't have the ambiance or services of a newer / more expensive hotel (like the Sanur Hyatt down the street). The hotel at the edge of the Sanur tourist area, so it's a longer (and hotter) walk (or a short cab ride) to the Sanur main street (shopping, restaurants). The Sanur tourist zone is smaller than the Kuta zone, so it's less first world / fully westernized than Kuta is, and has fewer restaurants, shops, bars, etc. The Sanur beach is OK but overall not as nice or pretty as other beaches (Kuta, Nusa Dua, Jimbaran). There also aren't as many water sports options (parasail, banana boat, diving, etc) at Sanur compared to Nusa Dua. But this hotel has a lot of pros: it's much more affordable than the higher-end luxury hotels (Hyatts, Four Seasons, etc.). By contrast, we had drinks and dinner at the Sanur Hyatt and it was expensive (full American prices, $20 for fruit drinks and $70 for dinner). The Plaza's common spaces and our room were very clean. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Food at the hotel was fine, with several restaurants and bar areas, including poolside. Pool was very nice. Hotel has a spa. Beach is only a 5 min walk away. There are a number of pleasant restaurants and bars in Sanur, both on the main Sanur street or in the adjoining big hotels. You can walk to them via street or along the beach, or take a a taxi for a dollar or two, there are drivers everywhere offering to drive you. (Check balieats for restaurant recommendations.) If you need western food, Dunkin Donuts and KFC are across the street, as is a nice jazz club, bakery, and restaurant (we had lunch there and it was good). This hotel great for people-watching, very international: most high end hotels in Bali seem to get dominated by one type of tourist or another (mostly Australians, or mostly Japanese, or mostly local/Indonesian, etc.) but you see a big mix of people at the Plaza. The Plaza has become a place where well-off locals have their wedding parties, etc. so the lobby is always full of people coming and going. The hotel is a very convenient location if you want to stay near the beach but you're also doing driving tours to the rest of the island. Almost all the island's tourist spots (Ubud, various temples, etc.) are north of Sanur / Denpasar / Jimbaran / Nusa Dua, and traffic is heavy and driving slow. From Sanur, Ubud is only 45 min away, so it's easy to go to Ubud just for the day. If you're down in the Nusa Dua area, it's a 45-min drive just to get to Sanur. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, as long as the person was aware of the pros and cons. If somebody was only in Bali to do a beach vacation and wanted to pampered and never leave the hotel, then there are other hotels in Nusa Dua or Jimbaran Bay that would offer a better (if more expensive) experience.

<Content>Paradise Plaza Hotel is just that - Paradise I have stayed at the Paradise Plaza Hotel in Bali twice and most definitely will stay again. A short walk to the beach markets at Sindu-beach then back in time for the full buffet breakfast.Then a dip in the pool, a game of billards, table tennis and I think time for a 'Tom Collins' at the bar. (It's 11 am isn't it?) The Paradise Plaza really suits families as well. The Sanur area is quieter than in or around Kuta and it's only 20 minutes to go there for shopping. Then back to the quiet life. The Paradise Plaza's bars and restrauants are excellent. They often have great deals where you can purchase a passport allowing to get 1/2 price food/discounted drinks at the Paradise Plaza. This will save you a fortune, particularly if you buy it from day one.Get a massage everyday at the plaza or go across the road to the local shops for it.The people are friendly at the Paradise Plaza and ALWAYS eager to help. You give them all a tip as it costs you hardly anything at all. Bali is a beatitiful place and Sanur is as good as it gets there. Very central area. Call in at the jazz club for some live jazz or blues. It 3 minutes walk away (near KFC.) I cannot speak highly enough of the place. The management team are all great and the CEO is always willing to help where he can. Not that you'll need any of his help as there are always an abundance of staff around.Need to get around? I use a very trusted friend. His name is Julian. He is very trusting, looking after your valuables in the car, he drives well and can help you out where to go, and how much you should pay for things. He has a email ketutjuliana@hotmail.com Send him an email and he will turn up at the airport in his 8 seater mini bus to take you around. He will soon become your friend too.Ask for Julian when in Sindu Beach. They all know him or call him 08123944518. This num,ber is from Bali so look up the internation code.This is all you need whilst there. You won't be disappointed
