<Content>Great Hotel, great staff !! We are just back from the Radisson in Frankfurt and we really loved it. The breakfast is very good with very efficient and professional service.The hotel is modern, good elevators, nice restaurants (a bit expensive for diner). The spa and fitness area is not large but enough. It's very well mantained,clean, very good service, sauna, steam room and the swimming pool has A GREAT and amazing VIEW over the city !!!The hotel is located 10 minutes by tram from the main central station of Frankfurt. The hotel also has several taxis in front of the hotel. Internet gratis, tea facilities in the room, heated floor in the bathroom. The only min. point is a window between the bedroom and the bathroom, totally unnecessary (I would never stay with my funny friends in the same bedroom because of this window that has curtine that can be opened from the bedroom side...We loved this hotel and will definetly come back.The reception is very friendly, professional and we had a great welcome upon arriving.

<Content>strange location, strange colors The Radisson is located a bit outside Frankfurt, close to the Messe and there is not much around there. The interior design tries to be modern, but is 鈥?in my view 鈥?only a random collection of styles and colors. Rooms are ok, but a bit on the small side with everything you would expect from a Radisson. Breakfast is truly excellent (once you find all the buffets 鈥?some are a bit hidden). Check-in friendly, but slow and a bit confused.So decent coice for a business hotel, biz there a definitely better choices in Frankfurt.

<Content>An American in Germany Radisson SAS is a unique find in Europe. It gives you the feel of American travel, so if it is your first time in Frankfurt and you don't speak German, this is a good place to stay. All staff is very internationally acommodating. The building is top of the line eco friendly.Rooms are 5 STAR. All modern, new construction. Eco friendly. Even glass in shower with speakers so you can watch tv while you shower.Bar/Restaurant with patio deck and lobby is 5 STAR. very modern and hip.Staff was 5+ STAR.Pool and Sauna etc area was 5 STAR. the pool overlooks the city on the top floor. it is a small pool, but a neat location. all facilities were clean and chic.The negatives--refridgerator in room doesn't let you store your own items. it has a laser sensor and will charge you thinking you are taking beverages from it.Room keys were needed to ride elevator, but we had to have our keys reset 2 times during stay.Location was not the best if you are there for leisure visit to Frankfurt. Business travelers will find this a good location.HOWEVER, Frankfurt has an incredible subway system, so getting around from there was ok.

<Content>Very pleasant stay in this hotel This is a fantastic hotel, there are 18 floors, and on the top floor, there is a swimming pool with sauna and steam room (with free towels and robes provided) and it overlooks the city. We booked in for two nights and were on the 13th floor, having booked a business class room. It cost 鈧?75 per night, but I really felt it was good value for money. All the business class rooms are at the end of the corridor and all have the curve of the coin shape for the windows. The room was nice and big with very comfortable bed, it was warm, there was a seating area, nice bathroom and with dressing gowns and slippers provided, this is great when you are travelling with hand luggage only. There is a Nespresso coffee machine provided which is great also with free coffee.The breakfast was included in the rate above and was more than adequate, there was a fantastic selection available, all sorts of cold meats, fresh fruits, yogurts, cereals, hot buffet, and then to finish it off, lots of Danish pastries. All very tasty!.The bar is situate behind the reception and is reasonably priced but I though 鈧? for a tiny bottle of Sprite was a little expensive. You wouldn鈥檛 spend all night there. The Radisson is situate just slightly out from the city centre but is accessible, presumably taxis were readily available, we didn鈥檛 need to use them but there is also a tram just round the corner which also takes you into the main station.All in all a very pleasant hotel, with very pleasant staff and I am staying there again in a couple of weeks.Tip: stay high up, the views are brilliant, ask to stay on the side with a view of the skyline, as opposed to the leafy side as you will have fabulous views at night, and if you can, go business, as you will have the best of the views (the rooms being on the curve of the coin shape) and a nice big room, there is only 鈧?5 in the difference I think plus you get breakfast included. Enjoy and I hope this helps.

<Content>Not bad... Stayed at the SAS Radisson from October 6th-10th, 2008 and overall it was a nice stay.The bed was comfortable and there was a menu of 12 different pillows on order. However, there is a distinct lack of wardrobe and drawer space, which is not a problem for 1 night, but for 4 nights it's an inconvenience!!!There's a laptop safe, mini bar and a tray with a kettle, tea and coffee, sugar etc.The bathroom is decorated with red rose wallpaper!!! The shower had good water pressure. For some reason, there is a window from the bathroom to the bedroom!!! Fortunately, there were blinds to block this window. Rather annoyingly, the bathroom has a speaker so you can listen to the TV - great in the morning, not so great late at night. This speaker has no volume control unlike the TV!!!There is a LCD TV - though only CNN and BBC World for English speakers. Also, there is internet access via free WiFi or broadband cable.The breakfast was pretty expensive at 鈧?6 even though it's an all you can eat buffet. A much cheaper option is to go to the coffee bar opposite reception - a latte and croissant is 鈧?.Gaia is the main hotel restaurant. All in all, the waiting staff are completely multi-lingual and very friendly and helpful. However, their time keeping leaves a lot to be desired. It took 45 mins from ordering drinks to ordering food (despite prompts). When ordered, the food arrived very quickly.A cheaper and quicker option is to order bar food at the Wunder Bar. The choice of malt whiskeys has to be seen to be believed!!! Also, the bar does great cocktails, that are reasonably priced from 鈧? to 鈧?1 respectively.The gym is fine for this sort of hotel. The swimming pool has great views across the city, but is rather small!!! The sauna and steam room are excellent.

<Content>Top class If you are looking for the best rooms, a very charming staff, and some sports facilities, this hotel is an excellent choice. I can definitely recommend it. The restaurant dinner is too expensive but no worries, a couple of great cheap italian and asian restaurants are within walking distance. The breakfast is also expensive but just fantastic. If you prefer a more simple breakfast there's coffee and a little croissant for a moderate price. I stayed here before and I can just say : great place. If they either lower the dinner prices or improve the quality it'll be an absolute 5+

<Content>Slick and modern and most impressive in almost every way Treated ourselves to a junior suite which proved very much more than impressive and comfortable in every respect.This is a truly unique and most impressive building let down only by its less than central location in midst of a forest of nonedescript office blocks.We therefore ate at the hotel for evening meal, which was perfectly high standard and fairly priced for the standard provided one resisted the 'inflate the bill' blandishments of the very pleasant and friendly staff.

<Content>Design or "NichtSein" - this is question - had good fun there This Hotel is unusual - for its Location, its Design and its entertainment options:DESIGNWlll this is all I can say, the Hotel is unusual - in many senses, but comfortable and well done and the price/performance ration is on the higher end:- Bathroom has a glass window to the bedroom, nice.- Traveller has 3 desgin options - i stayed in the Orange one.- The Reception is a stunning way with two layers of desks.- the coolest thing must be the glass winecellar visible from entrance hall on the first floor.- the kiosk to serve a quick bite works well in the morning- the Bar is fancy.ENTERTAINMENT- the two restaurants are pretty good and the Bar is lively in the evening (you get lime cordial which is unusual in Frankfurt!)- the Spa under the cricular roof on floor 18 allows fro an inifinty type pool over the skyline - wow.- there is a Gym, albeit small, with a few good machinesLOCATION- you are a bit away from the center but close to the airport.- around the hotel is no shopping area or high street in the classical sense - so spend your precious time in the hotel - its worth it.

<Content>Chic, radical but sometimes impractical When you arrive, particularly at night the place looks absolutely awesome. The design is most certainly different and quite radical. The Radisson website PDF brochure gives you the low-down and, in fairness is pretty accurate.Problem with radical designers is that they appear not to own clothes, underwear or shoes - lack of closet and drawer space I definitely found to be an issue in an otherwise superbly appointed room. If you have a high floor with city views you will not be disappointed ! Some of the decor is clearly ageing now and refurbishment will be needed soon in many roomsBreakfast buffet is not usually included in your rate and is very expensive for a pretty average experience. Bockenheim district has many places to eat at quarter of the price. If you walk into town you will pass many similar opportunities.Both hotel restaurants are excellent:Coast is a specialist seafood venue. I found it to be really top-notch and not an outrageous price.Gaia is the main hotel restaurant with a really good menu and superb food. I felt little need to venture out of the hotel for dinner as facilities were so good there - all at what I felt to be a reasonable price for the class of property.All staff are completely multi-lingual and very friendly and helpful.The hotel has secure well lit underground parking (at a premium). Street parking is available all times of day BUT I walked past a lot of broken glass so you take a risk.I used the hotel for touring by car. It is near major road networks and convenient for the airport. 30 minutes driving takes you to some beautiful countryside.Verdict - there were some minor irritations but I would go back and have no hesitation recommending it.

<Content>The stay was too short! This is an excellent hotel - stayed here on a short break in August.From the outside it is modern and stylish, and this continues inside too, with a nice big open lobby, seating areas, and a large bar with outside seating. My room was on the 11th floor, accessed by 4 speedy lifts, all with excellent views over the city. Yes - they're glass!The room was spacious, all modern fittings. One odd addition was a window from the bathroom to the bedroom, but there were blinds to block this. Not a problem for me, but if you were sharing the room and didn't want to share everything, you'd have to make use of the blind!I had a drink in the bar - table service was slow so I eventually just ordered at the bar, but everyone was helpful and pleasant.The hotel is a short tram-ride away from the city centre, and the system was efficient and regular enough to use as a shuttle. I'd imagine it being about a 30 minute walk though if you're a bit more energetic!All in all, a great hotel and well worth considering if you're in Frankfurt in the near future!

<Content>Stylish hotel with great views Just stayed there for one night while in Frankfurt on business. The hotel is very stylish - striking looking from the outside and inside. Check in was friendly and easy (as was check out later). Hotel room on the third floor was on the corner, so panoramic views. Large double bed, all the pillow choices you could ask for, huge shower with great water pressure, and fabulous decor in the bathroom. LCD TV - though only CNN and BBC World. My room was not only well equipped but spotlessly clean. If I had one gripe it was that the bed was too hard - so many hotels seem to think we all want the firmest of mattresses. Didn't eat there, so not able to comment on food - but the bar was friendly. Oh, and they have a gym on th 18th floor, with a sauna with floor to ceiling windows so you can enjoy the views - and a small pool.

<Content>Very nice !! Although it is a bit away from the city center (catching the train around the corner is very convenient) I found this hotel to be very accommodating. I was visiting Frankfurt with other travel agents on a FAM, so we had the honor of being hosted  chaperoned by 3 ladies on the hotel staff. We were given a tour of the hotel's restaurants, and business class rooms (as well as the Presidential Suite, which was awesome!) The sleeping rooms were clean, and the decor very modernized. Just be aware - your room key card turns on the lights to your room, plus allows you to use the elevator to go to your floor. Without it, you're in the dark and more than likely staying on the lobby floor! The one thing I really didn't care for was the shower/tub. It only has a half-'shower door', so the floor was getting wet everytime I showered. Oh well ....I liked this hotel very much. Its in a quieter location than the center of town. I will sure recommend this hotel to my clients.

<Content>Modern, stylish but outside city centre I have stayed at this hotel a number of times on business but also used it when we visited the Christmas market last year. The hotel looks great, a superb modern and stylish design. The rooms are in line with the overall design with heated floors, full room sound system and LCD TVs.The hotel has a limited gym and health spa on the top floor and excellent room service.Downside for me was the restuarant which was a bit disappointing given the price and the location. Its a good 8 minute journey on tram to the city centre and a long walk. Not really a problem if you can use taxis to get everywhere but on a personal trip the costs could add up.Would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Great conference hotel Last year at the Frankfurt bookfair I stayed at the Marriott (fine hotel, see separate review) but on balance I think this was better: only a ten minute walk to hall 8 for us English speakers, the hotel itself not to be faulted on hospitality, cleanliness, etc., in spite of what other reveiewers might say. The building is striking: a giantlozenge pushed into a tall modern office block. Check-in was pleasant and professional; the lifts numerous and quick at all times; my room on the 14th floor clean, simple and with a rather awesome view, for those squeamish about heights, of the western end of the city.Bathroom perfect, though with bizarre/fashionable red rose wallpaper and window through to the main room; room perfect, with the exceptionof a wardrobe designed for elves rather than humans, so little storage space was there in it. The bar was convenient and service good. The restaurant- breakfast time, at least- was full of helpful staff and the breakfast buffet awesome in its choice of meals, everywhere between healthy and amazingly meat product-filled. This is not a family hotel. It's not a hotel for tourists who want towalk out into the old town of frankfurt. It's not for those who want idiosyncratic, old-fashioned charm. It's modern, professionally run and- I thought- well designed for a business clientele.

<Content>Nice decor shame about the dirt It is a great shame that something as basic as giving the rooms a regular spring clean lets this hotel down. The decor is great, the breakfast is good and the restaurant serves well prepared (if rather dull) food. The first room I was shown to had a throw on the end of the bed that was covered in hair. The chair in the corner was worn and had a dirty mark on the top.The second room I was shown to had 2 suede cushions on the bed that had several greasy marks on them and there was a coffee stain on the carpet. I didn't ask to be moved again as I was only staying 1 night.The bathroom was spotless* so I think the problem here is that items that cannnot cleaned every day (throws, carpets and cushions) are just not cleaned at all. Location not great either but there is a nice decked area where you can sit outside to eat dinner (which is nice if you're only there for a brief trip)* If you are 5ft 3 and under you may find the toilets rather high. Apparently, my boss couldn't reach the floor when she needed to ahem use the facilities!

The hotel is a bit out on its own, but it's close to the city center as well as the airport. The room was great. Big, new TV, and free wireless internet.

Laundry given the friday night was returned on the Sunday after 3 phone calls to chase it up. Food in the restaurant was good quality but limited menu. Bar prices overpriced EUR9 for whisky and coke.

<Content>style... and? and? The SAS in Frankfurt has the uber-cool style that so many SAS hotels have, but it lacks any kind of, well, anything else. Its location is not good for much - far from any decent dining, so one ends up spending far too much time in one's room, or, even worse, eating solely at the hotel restaurant. Not to say the restaurant is bad, it's just the only practical option. There are lots of airline personnel in and out of the hotel, which is great if you want to have drinks with airline personnel, but it's a sign that the SAS doesn't really cater to the vacation crowd. Go there for business if you get a good rate - I did - and try to go somewhere else to eat. Frankfurt is too interesting and fun to waste it inside the SAS.

<Content>Not a great location for a tourist but perfect for a small conference It'll cost you 8-12 Euro for a taxi to the center of town, but if you don't mind being in a suburb (which also translates into no convenience shops, mini-marts, etc. nearby) it's a good hotel to stay at in Frankfurt. Rooms are very pleasant although the closets are absurdly narrow (10 wide?), but there's a tray with a hot water jug, tea and coffee in your room round-the-clock (which when you've arrived from another time zone is much appreciated), thick terrycloth bathrobe, lots of towels, bath mat and slippers, a very good buffet breakfast, and pleasant hotel bar in the evening.Service was good for the Continent and the free broadband throughout the hotel, a Radisson standard should become a trade standard.It's an excellent location to hold a small conference. Meeting rooms were well-stocked and pleasant , light and airy, and the tea breaks etc. replete with cakes, biscuits, cupcakes, candy bars, etc. And the center of town is only a 5-minute taxi ride away, providing some good restaurants for the evenings but not distracting during work hours. Would definitely recommend for a business meeting location.

<Content>Nice hotel Just spent a night at the Radisson during a recent business trip. Hotel location is great, close to both airport and city center. It is very modern, lobby is very stylish and you can see that everything is still very new.However it is not very cozy - it is definitely more a business hotel and less of a good choice for spending a private weekend.The service is very good and staff very friendly.Rooms are relatively small, but convenient and with great views. Absolute plus is the free broadband internet connection - very unusual.Food at the hotel restaurant is good, however not outstanding.Pool/Fitness area is located on the top floor with great views of the city. I found the pool very small and not warm enough.There is also a sauna from where you can see the city - very nice.All in all a good choice for Frankfurt.

<Content>Fantastic Modern Hotel! For the low cost of the rooms, this hotel can't be beaten! Ultra modern hotel and rooms and washrooms makes this hotel a pleasure to stay in. Granted, it's a 10 minute taxi ride from the downtown, but well worth the 8 euros taxi ride into the downtown area in order to stay at this lovely modern hotel. If you crave a clean, modern and comfortable hotel, you can't go wrong here. It's not the Ritz obviously (i.e. room service food is not great, no beautiful restaurants there) but as a basic hotel with great large rooms and fitness centre, this hotel is incredible! And great rates as well -enjoy it!

<Content>OK but won't be staying there again The good deal we obtained via the hotel's website went out the window when we upgraded to a Business Class room at check in (paying another 50% on top of the original price) because we were told we would have to do this if we wanted a baby bed in the room. The baby bed they then provided had no proper base and could not be used. This was not rectified when we informed reception after the first night. The room was clean and still had a new feel (nothing worn yet) but the colouring scheme (lots of greys) made it feel cold and it had a retro 70s look. TV and film info in the room were a month out of date and although we were two adults only one pair of slippers and robe were provided. Generally felt the hotel is more form than substance. Breakfast buffet was extensive and the quality average. Location not ideal unless you are visiting the Messe.

If you have a chance, go to the Wellness Center on the 18th Floor. The view is spectacular and the facilities are top-notch. And if you want a truly memorable experience, get a massage from Alex! I have never had a better massage.

<Content>Not the best location The brand new Radisson is located in an industrial suburb of Frankfurt but there's a direct tram to the train station which takes about 15 minutes if you need to go downtown. I usually stay closer to the center when I'm in Frankfurt but I like new hotels and I'm generally fond of the Radisson chain so I decided to give it a try. The hotel building really stands out in the neighbourhood, all the other buildings are dreary, grey industrial office buildings, the Radisson looks spectacular from outside. The industrial theme continues when you enter the hotel. It looks more like the reception area of some modern factory than a hotel, lots of visible concrete which is softened by clever large scale artwork which looks more expensive than it probably was.Check-in was smooth and friendly, I declined help with my bags and found my standard room easily. The rooms have a fair size and are equipped with just about anything you'll need for a short stay. The interiour is too colorful and ikeaish for my taste, like the lobby, it looks like the mission was to create a pleasant atmosphere without spending a lot of money. Not my taste but they did a good job nonetheless. The room had some good points, mainly the large flat screen TV and the great water pressure of the shower. But a few of my hotel room pet peeves where also present. The king-sized bed had two matresses. This may be fine for a couple who just wants to sleep but not for a single person who wants to stretch out on their bed. Also, everything in the mini bar and all the snacks are rigged to an electronic system which automatically bills you when you remove an item. I like to buy my own drinks and store them in the minibar, this isn't possible with this system. Most Intercontinental hotels also use it and I avoid staying in any of their hotels, I sure hope Radisson won't introduce this to their other hotels.Closet space is very limited, it's so narrow that you can hardly hang up a padded coat and a pair of trousers. The rest of the room was OK and very clean, the same is valid for the bathroom which is equipped with interesting fruit shampoos and conditiioners.Staff in the breakfast room where very friendly and showed you to your table and got one set up with coffee or tea. The buffet selection was fine if far from spectacular, unfortunately the warm dishes are all stored in warming bins instead of being cooked specially for the guest. Frankfurt has many old and dreary hotels which cater to the trade fair crowds. The Radisson is much nicer than average but the location is only acceptable if you're just passing through or have business to attend there.
