<Content>wonderful hotel Great location just a short 15-minute walk from the train station through an underground tunnel and within sight of the duomo. Our room was spacious and quiet and the good breakfast included scrambled eggs and several different cereals and breads. We were able to store our luggage until catching an afternoon train to Rome. Hotel management all spoke English. Free internet access in the lobby. Interesting location down a tiny alley and up an even tinier elevator to the second floor!

<Content>Our home away from home it Italy We have stayed at the Belletini for a few days every winter for the past four years. In our travels all over Italy we have no trouble making friends and I can truly say there is NO place like the Belletini. The staff are the best trained I have ever seen in any hotel, and also the friendliest. The location is perfect on a little side street near the center and within a few minutes walk of everything interesting. Yes, you do have to look just a bit, to find the door and that's what they gave us eyes for. Really quite easy and for those who don't see well, just ask anyone in the neighborhood. Everyone around knows this hotel and how to get there.The breakfast is buffet style and excellent, also served by staff that know their jobs well and actually smile and talk to you. The rooms are quite spacious and comfortable, excellent linens and firm beds. Above all, immaculate.In addition to all of this the prize jewel of this place is its wonderful owner and host, Gina. Not only is she friendly and accommodating, she is one of the most knowledgeable people one could ever hope to meet when it comes to what to do or where to go in Florence. In a pinch she is also on the spot with good advice or help if needed.This is not a five star hotel, it is a three star home away from home and that's a thousand times better.

<Content>Positives and Negatives I have mixed feelings about this hotel - we got a great price, and it was in a great location - near the Duomo, San Lorenzo Market, the train station, restaurants, shopping, etc etc. Our room was large and very clean, and had a small balcony with chairs and a table, overlooking the court yard. The staff was overall friendly and helpful. They had great coffee/capuccino/espresso. The negatives - the hotel was dated and the elevator was a frightful claustrophobic contraption that sometimes got stuck (as previous TA posters noted). The worst was discovering I had been bitten by at least 2 different kinds of bugs while staying there - but I think it was because we had our window open when it was hot (I didn't see any bugs in the room). I think I might try a different hotel next time......

<Content>Great Hotel in central Florence! Pros: This hotel was very clean. Staff were fabulous. Room was spacious. Location was central to cathedrals, markets and museums. Parking garage nearby, cost ~25 Euros/day. Internet cafe across the street. Great breakfast! Delicous cappuccinos.Cons: Shower was small and water was limited (heated within a holding tank in the bathroom). A little difficult to find as it's located on a small tight street with no parking out front. Without a car, it would be easier. :)I would recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget. It satisfied all my needs.

<Content>A lovely home away from home! With the rate of exchange making our travel more expensive, we searched for a wonderful hotel at a reasonable cost. What a gem we found in this small hotel. Located between San Lorenzo and the Duomo, we enjoyed hot water, comfortable firm mattresses, simply furnished but pristinely clean rooms, a lovely breakfast and a staff that treated you like family. The baths are not all totally modernized, but when the water is hot, and the towels are big enough to wrap around a big man, who cares? In my second week, we moved to room 45--the only 3rd floor room--with a view of the Duomo, San Lorenzo and Giotto's Campanile, windows that opened to breezes and the sound of bells every morning and evening! Not sure what we did to get so lucky--but we were on the top of the world! Thank you to Gina, Maria, and those handsome brothers Elman and Jimbo for beautiful days and nights, and afternoons filled with the scent of the croissants baking for breakfast!

<Content>Good spot, but noisy The great thing about this hotel is its location - walking distance from the main train station, the Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, the Ponte Vecchio, Uffizi museum etc. The breakfast is pretty good, the people are very helpful and happy to give advice, and there is free internet! It was however quite noisy when other guests are up and about. So stay here but only if you are a heavy sleeper or bring earplugs! Also take lightning-quick showers - the hot water tank was not large enough for 2 people.

<Content>Excellent place to stay. Wonderful staff. This was our second stay at the Bellettini. Both stays were delightful. The location is excellent: easy walking distance to all sites and the train station. Our room for both stays, was room 28: both spacious and quiet, with a view of the Duomo. Breakfast was very good. Best of all is the staff. Every single member of the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. They were particularly helpful in helping us when our tour guide for the Uffitzi failed to meet us. The staff at the Bellettini offered to call the company and see if they could fix the problem. And they did fix it. This was not a tour that we had booked through the hotel, but they nevertheless took it upon themselves to help us with our problem. I recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>Pleasant Stay The Winter Special rate at this hotel makes it the most affordable place in all of Italy! We paid 160 Euro(total) for three nights in a spacious room with a private bath. That rate also included breakfast! The staff is extremely pleasant and the location is perfect. For the price, I could not fault this place whatsoever!!

<Content>Great location; good staff; good breakfast I booked this on the basis of location, cost, listing in Lonely Planet and comments on this website. Location is great for all of the main sights of Florence and is less than a 10-minute walk from the station and away from the grotty station environment. Missed it on my first time down the street as it is on the first floor with elevator access so you need to be looking up for the overhead sign or at the plaque on the wall as you go along.Reception staff are pleasant and efficient, helpful with directions and recommendations. Very good breakfast buffet and free internet access are also really good points.For Florence, it is reasonably priced. My only complaint is that I could hear every movement and conversation from the room through one wall, without even making an effort to listen! This did not apply to the room on the other side so it may just be this one wall that is a problem. On the whole, a good enough place for the money though at quieter times of the year, there are probably better places to stay.

<Content>Modest, yet somehow lovely I chose this hotel after reading praising reviews on Tripadvisor and stayed in it for 4 nights in mid July. Also a motive was its location which is really great. It takes less then 10-15 minutes walk to reach most of the sights in the historical center. That includes the S.M.N. train station, very used by many tourists. The hotel is easy reachable, though on a small, winding street.One has to use the elevator which is narrow and works every other press of the button. Not at all very welcoming. But the hosts are! Signora Gina welcomes you with a large smile and kindness. During the stay, she along with the young man in charge with the breakfast and pretty much anything else will do a lot to make the guest feel at home. The room was basic, with the walls asking for whitewashing and the furniture tired. However, it was spacious, the air-conditioning was strong in cooling and the safety box useful as always. The bathroom was old and the shower area was slightly marked, leading to water spreading throughout it. However, the room (facing the rear part of the building) was quiet during the night, allowing me to sleep with the windows wide open. Finally, the buffet breakfast was rich and adequate to the season. However, I consider the location its main trump: you get out, turn right and in 5 minutes walk see Piazza del Duomo; turn left and reach la chiesa San Lorenzo; also several tratorias and the central market (with thousands of visitors) are nearby.

You must take a lift from the street to reach this hotel, which is on the second floor of a building. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was good. An easy walk from the train station and a short walk to the major museums and attractions.

<Content>Decent Hotel We were recommended this hotel by friend who obviously watch Rick Steve's. They raved about the hotel so we had high hopes. The room was right by the reception desk- a big mistake since it got quite noisy when we were trying to sleep. Our room had no view and a curtain only for the shower- we were essentially standing on the bathroom floor to shower. It DID have great air-conditioning and the room was larger than most Italian hotels. The breakfast was good. They also provided one computer for internet access. The location was fabulous. The staff was very helpful.

<Content>Best Hotel Experience in Italy! The Hotel Bellettini was our first stop in our two week trip to Italy. The Bellettini is a lovely well appointed hotel, conveniently located in the very middle of many of the most exceptional sights, shopping, and restaurants in Florence. Gina and her staff gave us the feeling that we were staying with good friends by showing us hospitality and a willingness to help in every detail of our Florence stay. The only hotel we stayed in that offered a full breakfast ; food and coffee were delicious. (I got a smiley face in my latte.) Our room was comfortable and boasted a balcony with flowers growing. We all had our most refreshing sleep in a peaceful guiet setting. Our daughter hopes to go back to Florence to visit with Gina next summer. Gina set up tours, tickets, offered helpful suggestions for shopping and restaurants; what more could a traveler ask for in a new city. I had studied in Italy almost forty years ago and this trip was like a pilgrimage for me. The staff of this hotel reminded me of many of the reasons it was so important for me to to return to Italy. We feel we now have made more than great memories of a city. We have experienced the warmth of friendship that we carry with us forever! Many thanks to Gina and the staff of the Hotel Bellettini!

However, the street and hotel noise kept us up most of the night. The room was shabby but comfortable, and the breakfast was good, but not excellent. The entrance was hard to find and the stairs/elevator hard to negotiate.

En suite room a bit small for a big man but manageable - shopping at market stalls and indoor market was a plus due to the starting location right around the corner from the hotel - tourist sites all were accessible within walking distance as were restaurants, trattorias and coffee shops. Definitely would book there again.

<Content>Comfortable and Family-Like We stayed in this conveniently located hotel early in March of this year. Given all the stellar comments on this site, I must say I was expecting more when I walked in. But, once there, there is a pleasant calm from the frenetic streets below (it doesn't have that many rooms, so there aren't big crowds of people moving in and out); and the brothers (Elmer and ?) are so kind and eager to please that you feel somehow you have Italian brothers and sisters (or cousins!) who want you to be comfortable, and enjoy the complicated city of Florence. It is about a 10 minute walk from the train station, and just around the corner from the Prince's Chapel, which is having a historical dig going on right now. The rooms are clean and basic, but still have some personality. The bathrooms are adequate, but no bathtub. The breakfast is great. I just loved the staff, though.

<Content>Loved the Bellettini and Ermal! Just returned from 10 nights in Italy and 5 nights at the Bellettini. We could not have been happier with this hotel. It is very centrally located which allowed us to walk everywhere! We had absolutely no problem finding the hotel, we were able to walk there with our luggage from the train station. From the start the staff was absolutely amazing! Gina warmly greeted us at the front desk on our first day and pointed us in the right direction for a fabulous lunch. I have nothing but great things to say about Ermal who is Gina's right hand man (I don't know when he sleeps, he was there from breakfast until we went to bed). He was friendly, helpful, funny and a blast hang out with in the lobby. Every afternoon we looked forward to coming back to the hotel and enjoying caffe with Ermal. Every afternoon he would give us a fabulous restaurant recommendation for dinner and even call ahead for reservations. Rick Steve's has stayed at the hotel several times and his Christmas cards to the staff are displayed at the front desk. I would recommend this hotel to anyone I know going to Florence and will definitely stay there again myself.

<Content>Beyond Our Expectations After coming from a dumpy hotel in Rome, the Bellettini was a pleasant surprise. The front desk agent was extremely welcoming and helpful and spoke fluent English. Our room was huge compared to other hotel rooms in Europe, and the bathroom was a decent size and provided a hair dryer. The continental breakfast was the best I have had in Europe so far: meats, cheeses, yogurt, fresh fruit, and cappucinos!! The hotel was centrally located near the Duomo and the train station. They also have free internet service in the lobby. I highly recommed the Bellettini Hotel.

<Content>Great Location, Very Nice Room We really liked the Hotel Bellettini -- terrific location about 3 blocks from Piazza Duomo and the center of Florence. We had a wonderful room on the very top floor, spacious with a nice bathroom (ours was the only room on the top floor, so there was no noise at all). There was nothing luxury or fancy about the hotel, but it was clean and convenient and a good value. We should note three potential issues to consider: first, the hotel was extremely difficult to find, as it's located in an alley; second, because it's tucked away in an alley, some people may be uncomfortable coming and going at night (we weren't and there was never any problem); and third, there's no on-site car parking.

<Content>Loved the Bellettini. My wife and i have just returned from our week long stay at the Bellettini and we loved the place, we would stay here again, we were greeted by our porter who checked us in, gave us a city map, pointed out the main visits to do when in Florence, Duomo etc. told us about the bus routes, carried our suitcase up to our room. The room was airy and light, as we opened the shuttered windows we were greeted by a view of the Medici chapel dome to our left and the tip of the Campanile to our right, a room with a view. The hotel is ideally situated for all the sights and sounds of Florence, is a gentle 7 minute stroll to the train station,shops, restaraunts, sights, markets, are all easy to walk to from the hotel. Breakfasts in the morning are of a healthy variety, the lift (elevator) was sometimes tempramental, but hte staff are all very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Our second stay at the Hotel Bellettini My wife and I just returned from Europe, where we stayed at the Hotel Bellettini for the second time in three years. We had another pleasant stay. If you're considering this centrally-located hotel in Florence, here's what you need to know. On the downside, the property and its furnishings are dated. There's nothing new or sparkling here. But this is after all, a 2-star hotel. And there are the usual small European bathrooms and tiny elevator (but many 2-star hotels don't even have an elevator). The pluses are the reasons we go back: Bellettini has a great location, close to the Duomo, train station, Central Market, and Plaza del Reppublica. The price was right for us (144 Euros), especially considering its location. The breakfast bar is better than what we've found in some 3-star hotels, enough to satisfy even my hearty appetite with meats, cheeses, cereals, fruits, yogurts, and bread. There's even a bar in the lobby, where we've met so many interesting people who were also staying there. Finally, it's the warm, helpful staff that made us feel so welcome on both our visits. We would return to the Hotel Bellettini again.

<Content>Very Friendly hotel We stayed at the Bellettini for 3 nights in September. As frequent visitors to Florence we were very happily surprised by this hotel. We have stayed in quite a few 3 Stars and this exceded many of them in terms of quality. The rooms are clean and very spacious and the warm welcome from Gina and the staff help to make this a throughly nice place to stay. On top of this it's a location that is an easy walk from the train station and a stones throw from the Medici chapels.Special thanks must also go to the two brothers who serve breakfasts, they couldn't do enough for us, and their courteous manner is a real credit to the hotel.

<Content>Ah, Firenze! The Hotel Bellettini is very conveniently located a short walk or taxi ride from the Santa Maria Novella train station in Florence. We stayed there for two nights in a suprisingly large twin room, with TV, private walk-in shower room (incl. toilet, bidet and wash basin). The room was very clean and we weren't phased by the shower-room (we actually thought it was quite practical and enjoyed great showers). The hotel had a lot of character, so whilst not being decorated in a modern or contemporary way - there was a mixture of charming local prints/paintings and interesting pieces of furniture. The continental breakfast was a good selection of fruit, pastries and breads, even with a selection of meat and cheese. The staff also made great coffees on demand. The staff were very polite and helpful and spoke English very well. It is worth noting that it is located on the first floor of a larger building and there is a lift - which helps with any heavy cases, although - there are stairs leading to the lift and in the hotel itself, so perhaps not ideal for wheel-chair users. The price was reasonable for Florence, but we did stay more reasonably in a Siena hotel, which was of equal standard.

<Content>Great location, but not very clean Indeed it is an excellent location. However, I stayed there unknowingly for the second time a few weeks ago (I didn't recall the name of the hotel I disliked 7 years ago). So, now I have been there twice. It looks NOTHING like the photos on the website. It hasn't been renovated in far too long, is shabbily furnished, and not very clean. The two young men who work breakfast are so sweet and delightful. Shame the owner is a unpleasant person who yells at her staff in front of all the guests and is actually short with guests when she is in a bad mood.

<Content>The Bellettini offers great location and value. I stayed at the Bellettini for nine nights this May. Location on a quiet street in city center cannot be beat. The hotel is two to fifteen minutes from everything, with some good restaurants right around the corner. (Try the Trattoria Antellesi on Via Faenza.) Extremely safe hotel for women traveling alone. Clean rooms (including in-room safes) and friendly staff people who provide help and answers to questions. They arranged for a driver for me for a day in the country who was fabulous and charged half what the tour brochure people wanted. Bathrooms are small but I've seen smaller in Europe, and they are clean with good water pressure, showers that work, and hairdryers. (The shower arrangements are a bit strange but that is the problem of retrofitting an old building with modern bathrooms, I think.) The new air conditioners keep rooms as cool as you want. Breakfasts are a joy with lots of fresh fruit, yogurts, cheeses, hams, breads, cakes, and even genuine cappuccinos. I do wish they would offer hard-boiled eggs. Free high-speed internet, a cozy lobby, and an international clientele add to the enjoyable ambience. Even though there was some initial confusion about my reservation, Gina worked very hard to provide me with the kind of room I had reserved and all worked out very satisfactorily. I stayed in two different rooms the first two nights before moving into the third one where I stayed the last six nights. However, the staff moved me each day, and I got to sample several rooms. I think the Bellettini is a real find in the heart of Florence.

<Content>Never again! After going there and now re-reading some of the reviews I can't believe this is the same place! I wish I had taken a picture of the prison-like room we were offered at this hotel before we decided to leave. We arrived and asked for a room with two beds and we were presented with what basically resembled a prison cell. The room was long and narrow and had the beds set up head to toe, with an armoire in between. The width of the room was less than my height if I was to lay down on the ground (I'm 5'5). The bathroom was old and nasty. We knew from the moment we walked in that we would not be spending the night there. After speaking to the person at the front desk she offered us a better room, but it was still dark and not nearly as nice as what the review on this site or otherwise had said. We ultimately left the hotel and were charged a room-night for canceling on the day of arrival. We ended up staying at the Rezidenzia dei Pucci. Our room was very comfortable, bright and clean. The staff was very helpful and although the breakfast was not over-the-top (yogurts and fruits) I would definitely stay there again, certainly over Bellettini!!

<Content>A Real Pleasure I was very pleased with the hotel during my stay there in January, 2006. It's a half block from the San Lorenzo street fair and only a few blocks from the Duomo, and a manageable walk from the train station (even with a very large bag). The staff was very friendly, the breakfast good, and I never had any problem using the free internet connection. There is a lift to the hotel lobby, but my room was on the 2nd floor, which is only accessible by stairs. If you overpack, as I do, this may not be ideal if you're only staying a day or two, but there weren't many stairs and it was well worth it for me since they gave me a very large double room in spite of my being a single. I will definitely make the Belletini my first choice for future trips to Firenze.

<Content>Good location and clean, but over-rated! We just returned from Tuscany after nearly three weeks and Hotel Bellettini is where we spent our last evening before heading back. Its location is good - close to the Duomo - and it's clean. The rooms are incredibly sparse - which is fine by us, but a dramatic contrast to some of the 'charming' references that we'd read from others. It's loud - our room was near the reception so that may have been it - but you can definitely hear those above and next to you. The staff was average at best - again, a contrast to what we'd read and what we experienced on the rest of our trip.We felt is was definitely over-rated. Unfortunately, they displayed their holiday postcards (3 consecutive years) from one guide book author - and this sort of creeped us out. Made us wonder about the objectivity of the author's review - and whether the hotel was trying as hard as they once may have.

<Content>Great little 2 star hotel We took the advice of famed public TV critic, Rick you-know-who, and gave Hotel Belletini a try. It was perfect for our needs - providing a quick getaway for an early return flight. We were met by gracious hostess, and served the authentic style hot chocolate to try. (we had been advised by other travellers not to miss this, they were not wrong!!) The room was large, comfortable. The bath was not large, but adequate. The hotel was an easy walk from the train, and the taxi to the airport came immediately and was E18 for 2. The Galleria and Cathedral easilly reached on foot, and excellent restaurants and street sales for leather, silk, etc. nearby. We were there less than 24 hours, but a fine stay. The included breakfast was hearty, many choices of pastry, bread, meats, cheeses, yogurt, fruit, juices, cereals etc.

<Content>Loved hotel bellettini We really enjoyed the Hotel Belletini, especially the attitude of the staff. Our room was very adequate, breakfast was excellent and the two young men who help (probably, two brothers) are a joy! Their attitude is upbeat ( one morning a flower on the top of my cappucino and the second morning a smiley face)We make the comparison with two hotels (Boscolo Palace, very noisy, and Pesaro Cruiser, very nice, that were paid for by business) Bellettini was excellent for the money

<Content>Wonderful location and friendly staff! My fiance and I stayed in the main building for four nights. The room was large but sparsely decorated, it was clean but there was a large water stain on the ceiling. The biggest negative was the very small shower. The location and the staff made our stay very enjoyable. The front desk was so helpful and knowledgeable. One of the sites I wanted to see was closed and requires reservations six months in advance, the front desk offered great alternatives and told me that if I ever return to Florence she would take care of the reservations for me even if I did not stay at the Belletini on my return trip. When we left I forgot to tip our housekeeper, I returned to the Belletini about a week later to leave the tip and the hotel staff said that they did not give me my full discount. They refunded me 30 eruos. I had no idea that I was over charged and I was so impressed by their honesty. The young man at breakfast was so friendly and cheerful he got us off to a great start each morning.

<Content>A hotel with lots of charm I loved this hotel and so did my two teenage children, who had a separate room. We stayed in the Annex, which is around the corner from the main hotel. The room was very large, clean, and comfortable. It is beautifully decorated and has a lot of charm. It even had a bathrobe for each guest! I felt like I was staying at a five-star hotel. When we stayed there, the Internet access was not available, but there are very inexpensive Internet cafes very close by. The hotel has an elevator in the main building and in the Annex, but I am not sure I would recommend it for persons that are wheelchair bound.The location is excellent, a short walk from the Duomo, the Medici Palace and Chapel, the Ufizzi, and the Academia. The breakfast buffet has an ample selection. I would definitely stay here again. It is a great value for the price.

<Content>Totally memorable stay Stayed in the triple room in the annex. Beautiful spacious room. Cold bottled water in the fridge a major plus. Only two cups and saucers which was odd for a triple room. Kept meaning to say but didn't, sure they would have done something about it if pointed out. Great breakfasts and friendly staff. Not keen on lifts and the one they had is coffin like, however a ring on the bell to let you up the stairs is not a problem. Would throroughly recommend for its postition and welcome.

<Content>Loved Florence Hotel is the the heart of the city yet tucked away on a side street so you avoid the street noise. If you can book a room in the annex do so. The staff is friendly and speak fluent English. They can assist you as much or as little as you like in order to make your stay in Florence rewarding. Florence is very pedestrian friendly and the Bellettini is convenient to all major sites.

<Content>It was Ok This is a good little hotel in the heart of Florence. The rooms were clean but had a slight odor that we couldn't quite figure out. Bathroom was adequate but not what we had experienced in another hotel in Florence. Some of the staff was helpful some were indifferent. We frequently had to go behind the desk to get our key as they were busy chatting with each other. There was a young, high school age boy that worked at breakfat time and he was delightful. A group of teenagers touring were staying there also. My point to that comment is that while they arrived the day we were leaving, the hotel itself seems to lend itself to a younger more, for lack of a better word, bohemian group. No offense, please. It was set up more to accomodate a younger crowd. There is a computer for use but impossible for me to send email or go to any website and the staff didn't seem too concerned when a couple of young children monopolized the computer for over an hour despite the fact that adults were in line to use it also. All in all, next time we will bypass this hotel.

<Content>For a good stay, choose the annex Stayed 5 days at the Bellettini.Fist night was in the main building. Then we asked to switch to Annex.Main building rooms are quite bad, dirty bathrooms, very noisy. Not a pleasant place to be.Annex rooms are a world apart, nice clean bathrooms, marble floors, frescoed ceiling and quiet. It's a 2-minute walk to main lobby, which we didn't mind at all for the quality we were getting for only 30 euros more per night! (we went in November 2004)Staff was friendly and helpful at all times. Godd buffet breakfast. Good location.To recap, main building rooms: 1 star, annex rooms, 4 stars.B.

<Content>Nice and a Good Value My wife and I enjoyed the hotel. The staff is very nice for the most part. The breakfast is nice, especially the cappucino. The annex is great but removed from the main hotel. We liked the rooms. The service is o.k. The maid did not always replace all of the towels; the towel warmer rack did not work some of the time; sometimes they would fill extra tea bags for tea and sometimes not; we never got bars of soap so I had to ask, etc. I do think this hotel is a great value given the size of the rooms, the location, and the price. You can get their easily walking from the train station, but it can be a challenge dodging cars and bikes on the street. I recommend a taxi (7 euros for 2 people with luggage), although you will still have to carry your bags from the hotel to the annex if you stay there. Lots of good restaurants in the area. We liked Tratoria Antellesi, which is very close.

<Content>A lovely time in a lovely place We stayed in the Belletini in October. We were two couples staying in two different rooms in the annex. While checking in, we viewed the rooms within the main hotel and were happy with our choice of staying in the annex.The lift up to the main hotel checkin is a bit cramped . The lobby is poorly decorated. The breakfast each morning was very good and the very very short walk from the annex to the main hotel is not a problem.the staff is very helpful and friendly. The annex rooms were pretty ,large and the bathrooms beautiful with a robe given to each person for use while in the hotel.The fresco's on the ceilings are pretty although I wish they were facing you while laying in bed..they were turned the opposite direction.All in all, we would stay there again.

<Content>Great 3 star hotel To the person from Somers Point N.J ,who stayed at the hotel Belletini Via De Conti . Florence in October 2004 . Suggest that if you want 5 star treatment when on holiday , you should save up and book a 5 star hotel . We stayed there and everything was wonderful . Obviously mistakes can happen but that is the case in any country even America . Of course ancient cities like Florence have problems with their drainage system ! From Sylvia and Bill in Aldershot , England .

<Content>Very Dissapointing! I stayed at The Belletini in October 2004. After reading reviews and Rick Steeves book I thought this would be a hit. Upon arriving three couples were given our rooms. All of them were small and noisy. Our room was the dirtiest, darkened room, with a horrible smell of sewer in the bathroom. The shower wasn't big enough to turn around in. The floors were so dirty we had to use towels to walk from the shower into the beds at night! The only good thing about this place was the front desk staff was very nice. After staying at the La Calcina in Venice we were very dissapointed!

<Content>Excellent location, friendly staff Our family of 4 stayed at Hotel Bellettini for 3 nights in Aug 2004. The location was excellent, rooms were clean and above all the staff was A+! At the reception desk, Gina helped us check in earlier. Maria Theresia was very helpful and always with a smile! Same goes to the Breakfast staff - do not know their names - they made our day, with their polite kind and cheerful attitude. The bells of San Lorenzo made the atmosphere unique.  We hope we can go back to Firenze sometime and if we do - Hotel Bellittini it will be!!

<Content>Serene convenience Having just returned from an Italian trip including Bellitini and reading the previous review I would just like to add another perspective.Certainly agree with the benefits quoted previously re position, breakfast, etcMy wife stayed there previously and we chose to go back to the annex which is air conditioned and the main section is not - pleasant relief after sightseeing in summer.Additionally my wife heard at breakfast that some of the main were fairly noisy from street traffic wheras the annex is QUIET!Having used two annex rooms at different times light was not an issue for us.The annex is on the opposite side of the same block and the only time we can see this split location being a problem is going to breakfast / checking in-out while it is raining.Basically a great balance of price / features for a hotel.

<Content>Stayed in the annex My daughter and I stayed two nights at the Bellettini annex in July, 2004. We would have been happier staying in the main hotel. The annex is a couple of blocks away, which is annoying if you want ice or something from the front desk. Also, you have to unlock three doors in the annex building before you even get to your room, so it takes awhile.On the plus side, the fresco on the ceiling of the room was beautiful and the bathroom was large and the nicest of all our hotel bathrooms during our month-long trip in Europe, but the room was dark, facing an inner courtyard, plus we didn't like the distance from the hotel. Also, we never saw or heard another person in the annex building. It was a little eerie!In the hotel itself, the lobby is charming and cozy. A real plus is the computer with free Internet access. I read somewhere that the access was slow, but they've obviously upgraded their connection because it was as fast as our cable modem connection at home. Breakfast was good and the hotel's location is great, just a few minutes' walk from the Duomo and the Accademia and also easy walking to the Arno.All in all, we'd definitely stay at the Bellettini again, but we'd save a lot of money and inconvenience by staying in the hotel proper rather than the overrated annex.
