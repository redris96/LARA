<Content>Budget Price with World Class Service My wife and I stayed at Hotel Hermes for 8 days in December 2008, and were immensely pleased. The price is very reasonable for Florence, and the rooms are more than adequate. The room was good sized by European standards, modestly furnished, and the bathroom small but adequately appointed. Most importantly the rooms were clean and the bed sheets freshly washed and crisp. It is what I call a barefoot hotel -- clean enough to walk about in bare feet or socks. If you are looking for a hotel with all the fancy amenities, such as gym, spa, bar and restaurant, or shopping, then Hermes is not for you. But if you are looking for a low cost, clean, excellently located hotel with world class service, then Hermes fits the bill.Two features deserve special note -- the hotel's location and the owner/operator (Patricia). Others have noted much of what I will say, but it bears repeating. The hotel is perfectly located -- a 10 minute easy walk from the center of town or the central Market, and adjacent to the Santa Maria Novella main train station, local bus terminals, and regional (SITA) bus terminals. It makes it easy to reach other parts of Italy (we went to Milan), or other parts of Tuscany. After the cleanliness and price (which are important to us), the primary reason to go to Hermes is Patricia - the owner. You go in as a stranger, and truly leave a friend (assuming you take the time to get to know her). She is more than a hotel operator -- she provides excellent advice on restaurants (tailored to your desires and budget), help on arranging tickets for the main attractions, transportation advice, and recommendations on cool places to visit in Tuscany. She made excellent recommendations on special foods to try -- which were spot on. In short, Patricia is the hotel owner you WANT to have, but so often DON'T GET. In short, the Hermes more than met our expectations and we had an enjoyable stay. Highly recommended.

<Content>Frugal Firenze I've been meaning to write a review since my husband and I stayed at the Hotel Hermes a few months ago--so here goes. Researching hotels in Florence when you're on a tight budget can be a disheartening task. I took a chance on the Hotel Hermes and contacted Patricia directly via email. Even with the cross-Atlantic time difference, she was back to me immediately. Over the next few days, we had booked not only the room, but our Uffizi tickets and a few excellent restaurants. Patricia did all of this for us with no qualms. The hotel is very basic-but it is extremely clean and Patricia and her staff will do all they can to ensure that you are taken care of. I celebrated my birthday while in Florence and Patricia very thoughtfully put a lovely long-stemmed rose in our room with a hand-written letter. It was such an easy thing to do, but I found it very touching. My husband and I have done quite a bit of traveling in Europe over the years, and we have grown accustomed to the tiny bathrooms and hard beds. Yes, it feels a bit odd to take a shower with the toilet just behind you (a bit like taking a shower on a boat, if you know what I mean); yes, the breakfast was very light (great cappucino, but just a puffy roll with jam--some cheese would be even better); and yes, the furnishings were sparse. What we appreciated most at the Hotel Hermes was the human touch, the cleanliness, the air conditioning and the very low (for Florence!) nightly rate. At the end of the day, we weren't spending all that much time in the room. We were pleased with our stay at the Hotel Hermes.

<Content>Thank you Patricia Just to confirm what others have said - that Patricia is beyond helpful, and will do her best to help you out with any advice - she booked our museum trips for us at no extra charge. We visited Florence for 4 nights with our 13 year old son and had a wondeful time in the Uffizi and Academy and eating at places like Za Za (although the Pound could have been stronger against the Euro!). Patricia is a very interesting host and always gave us her time and attention - thanks Patricia for making our stay in Florence so enjoyable.

<Content>Not a 5* hotel, but 5* service! When you stay in a 2* property and pay a 2* price, I think we should not expect a 5* property.Me and my family stayed here for a week in Sept 2008 and we absolutely loved it. Sure it was different from the St Regis Rome where we stayed before coming here but we decided to save money on the hotel and spend it on shopping and were we glad that we did it.If you are planning to stay in the hotel most of the time, then this hotel is NOT for you. But if you are planning to go out and discover what Florence and Tuscany has to offer, have some cash for shopping and eating and just treat the hotel as a place to rest overnight, then you can't go wrong with the Hermes.Location wise, it is right next to the train station. There are 2 supermarkets within a stone's throw of the hotel and the SITA long distance bus terminal was also a 5 min walk away. It was convenient to get anywhere from this hotel. Getting to the Duomo and the Uffizi was also easy... Florence is not that big a city anyway.Yes, there is no elevator and you will have to lug your bags up the stairs but if you book in advance, ask them for a room on the same floor as reception... We did and we got a nice room on the 2nd floor. The included breakfast was basic but good enough to start the day and they made a good cappucino for us every morning to start the day.Service.... Ah... this was what really set the Hermes apart. When my sis got her mobile phone stolen, Patricia called our hotel in Rome to check without us even asking. She then pointed out the way to the Police station on a map and told us the bus number to get there. We managed to get there with no fuss and got the report made.She also recommended some good restaurants to us and gave us accurate advice on our trips out of Florence. Her other colleagues Rosie and Paulo were also super nice and went out of their way to help us whenever they could.Would I recommend this place, I sure would! But only for those who want a clean place with the basic necessities to spend the night. If you are on a honeymoon, you may want to spend more and stay at a nicer place since you won't be leaving the room much. :) But for tourists like me who want to sightsee and shop and just spend about 7 hours in the hotel to sleep, Hermes is a great find in expensive Florence.

<Content>What are all these people talking about??? I can't believe all of the excellent ratings for this hotel. I just don't get it. Yes, Patricia is extremely helpful, fluent in several languages, and goes out of her way to make you welcome. That said, the place itself is a bit of a dump. It is a very inexpensive hotel in an expensive city, but the whole place was a bit dated, had a institutional odor to it, and had the charm of a funeral home. Walking up the steps to the hotel, my girlfriend and I had to step over a condom, yes, a condom, on the steps. Lots of guys hanging around the desk and hallway. My girlfriend swears it was a house of prostitution. Patricia did arrange a taxi for us the following morning, we stayed only one night, but did give us wrong information as to the cost of the fare. The rooms are clean, large, the bathroom very small. It was passable for one night, but I was glad to leave the following morning and would not recommend it for an extended stay unless you are on a very tight budget and don't care about the look and feel of the place.

<Content>great little hotel After searching for a hotel for our six day break,we booked this hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. Its a great little hotel very clean and in a great location near to both the train station and the bus station. The staff are lovely,Patricia,Rosie and Settimio are so helpful and friendly. Florence hotels are quite expensive but this hotel which includes a nice continental breakfast is excellent value. Would definately stay here again and recommend it to anyone.B  R Liverpool

<Content>Great little family run hotel, value for money in the heart of Firenze We booked this hotel based on the many good reviews made by other travellers on trip advisor. We were hoping to get some of the pleasant experiences that other travellers have had and well, we weren't disappointed. Hotel Hermes is a charming, clean, family run hotel, superbly priced and fantastically located in the city and also close to the train station (which we were desperately grateful for at the time as the wheels on one of our bags had been violently dislocated courtesy of a certain airline during our flight to Pisa and so I was dragging a heavy bag at that time).For the time being there is some road construction going on near the hotel, which is no big deal in my opinion, but this detracts somewhat for the quaint frontage of the hotel, but this construction seems to be well advanced and will no doubt be finished soon. Having stayed in Florence before, I know the hell that can await in some of the budget hotels in the city. Budget, rustic, accomodation in this city, if you can get it right, pays big dividends as luxury accomodation is, in my opinion, not even close to being worth it in Florence. The staff are a delight despite some of the language barriers, but this is more than made up for by one Patricia, who takes hospitality to new frontiers - she welcomed us like friends with perfect and eloquent english, booked dinner for us at the last moment by getting on the phone and ringing a local favourite, and made sure that everything was in order at all times during our stay and even afterwards (by email). When we arrived we were also given a map and a quick whistle stop guide to the important sights of Florence. Good stuff! Bravo!The room we stayed in was immaculately clean, large, with huge ceilings, and venetian style wood windows opening into a small atrium/courtyard. We also had a private bathroom (shower only) which was spotless, fairly modern, a little on the small side, but it was more than satisfactory. With these huge rooms and small corriders, the 'accoustics' of the hotel aren't great and the movement of some louder guests during the run for breakfast can sometimes be heard from bed. Not a big issue, and in fact the only negative thing I can say about the hotel. Help or assistance is never more than a bell ring away, and Patricia and her staff bent over backwards to make sure we were not strangers in our favourite city in Europe, for which we are very grateful. We will be back soon (hopefully easter), and Hermes is first on our list as a home away from home. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Hamish  Danielle

<Content>Hotel Hermes - Great place to stay while in Florence, Italy. On my recent visit to Florence, Italy I was lucky enough to have stayed at the Hotel Hermes. The hotel manager, Patricia was very pleasant and accomodating upon my arrival. She provided storage and safe keeping of my luggage while I toured Florence and she provided a tourist map that indicated all the major attractions. She went as far as to take the time to help me map out the best routes to take from the Hotel to each attraction. The Hotel is near the station and close to all major attractions. There is underground parking that cost 21 euro but you can get a 3 euro discount if you tell the attendant that you are staying in the Hermes. The parking garage opens at 0730 and closes at 1230 (noon) each day. The room was large with a queen size bed and had a television, sink and bidet. Down the hall from the room was another bathroom that had a shower. For just 40 euro a night (military discount) I had a room, complimentary breakfast and complimentary bottle of wine. You will not get a better deal anywhere in Italy for the accomodations. Thanks Patricia for your hospitality and kindess.

<Content>Warm, friendly welcom After spending a (pricey) week in Paris, my mother and I were looking for a convenient, clean, but inexpensive hotel in which to stay with my 7 month old daughter while we were in Florence. I searched through reviews on Trip Advisor, stumbling upon the Hotel Hermes.I can only concur with what others have said before. Patricia, Rosy and the rest of the staff will make you feel like you're long lost family. When we arrived, Patricia had already left for the day, but left a lovely, personal note, urging us to call if we had difficulty communicating with the night person, who spoke limited English. The next morning at breakfast, we met Rosy, who immediately fell in love with my daughter and insisted on holding her while we ate our breakfast. (She or Patricia did this every morning we were there!)The hotel is close to the train station, as well as within walking distance to the major sights. Patricia will help with reservations to the Academy or Uffizi.The construction out front cannot be heard in the rooms, which are spacious and spotless. (Slight sewage smell at times in the bathroom - as someone else said, maybe related to the construction.) Although the hotel did not have amenities for babies, Patricia offered extra blankets or pillows or whatever we needed to make things comfortable for my daughter. (We brought our own bed, so it was no big deal.)If you are looking to stay within a budget, the 2 star Hotel Hermes will certainly meet/exceed your expectations. We will miss our new friends!

<Content>Convenient, affordable, great value Having stayed previously in several hard-to-locate Florentine hotels far removed from the city center, the Hermes was a welcome sight, located only steps from the Florence train station. It is very convenient to all the city attractions and an easy walk to any of the piazzas. The rooms are comfortable, air-conditioned, well-kept, and very affordable, and one would be hard-pressed to find a more congenial and helpful staff. The owner speaks several languages, and can recommend places for sightseeing, dining, and shopping. I have told many friends about this great place!

<Content>Comfortable and friendly stay We stayed here only 2 nights in the Italian summer and were very grateful for the well airconditioned, large and clean room. It was very close to the train station and there is only a few flights of stairs up to your room, with a landing along the way if you're struggling!On arrival, we were so impressed by the lovely personal letter written to us by Pat, the owner, apologising for not meeting us in person that night. She also invited us to a community event being held at San Lorenzo involving free pasta and watermelon!We thoroughly appreciated Pat's travel advice and enthusiastic hospitality. She also makes a great cappuccino, and has lovely helpful staff.Unfortunately, the only down point to our stay, was the occasional waft of sewerage smell in our room. We believe that may have been due to the construction work occurring across from the hotel at that time.We would certainly stay at this hotel again!

<Content>A real bargain for a nice small hotel in central Florence The Hotel Hermes is a real bargain for a nice small hotel located in central Florence. Our room with a large window opening into an interior patio was air-conditioned, large, clean and comfortable. It had an attached modern bathroom with shower. Three of us (two parents and a 9-year-old) stayed comfortably in the room for four days. The room had a double bed and a single bed, both with good mattresses and clean crisp linens provided daily. The owner is an expatriate American, brought up in Mexico, who married a Florentine--very charming, speaks many languages and helped book us tickets at the Uffizi and the Academia, and gave us many good ideas for things to see and good restaurants. Our son enjoyed the Cappucino provided with our continental breakfast each morning. The staff are cheerful and helpful and the hotel has a family atmosphere. Many of the guests are Europeans, not Americans. The hotel is across the street from the main railroad station and many buses stop nearby, so it is very easy to get around Florence. We walked to all the sights, however, as it is very conveniently located. Despite its central location, we did not find the hotel rooms noisy at all. I would recommend this hotel particularly for families and students who want to visit Florence, be comfortable, be centrally located, but stay within a budget in an expensive town.

<Content>Great hotel At a friend's suggestion, I stayed at this simple and pleasant hotel last summer and highly recommend it. My room was large, comfortable, and very clean. The real attractions of this hotel, however, are its excellent location and extremely helpful staff. The Hotel Hermes is in the middle of Florence, right near the main train station (Santa Maria Novella) -- an easy walk even with luggage. It's an easy and interesting ten-minute-or-less walk to pretty much anywhere in the city. The staff are kind and helpful. The owner knows every inch of Florence. She is a terrific resource. The Hotel Hermes is a great deal. I will definitely stay there the next time I go to Florence -- hopefully later this year!

<Content>Happy at the Hermes During my stay at the Hermes I appreciated the spotless, spacious rooms, the location, and the friendliness of the staff, but the best part was being able to talk with the remarkable woman who owns the hotel. She is a longtime Florentine with deep roots (and family) in the U.S., so I felt very much at home. Plus I learned more about Italian life and politics in my three days here than from weeks of reading the Herald Trib. I'll stay at the Hermes when I come back to Florence and will be renewing a friendship, not just returning to a great deal on a hotel. Many of the other guests--Europeans, South Americans, and Americans when I was there--seemed to share this feeling. Highly recommended.

<Content>Great , in every way! Are you planning a trip to Florence and want something real stepping?! Hotel Hermes gave my father and me a wonderful step to everything!! It麓s right a few steps from the train station, steps from the bus stop, steps from shops, restaurants, and you only have to climb a few steps to enter into a very warm and charming place, with cozy details that Paty and Andrea Baglioni (owners) personally arranged for the tourist to feel at home.My father and I made a month-trip to Europe last September, and we had the opportunity to stay in great hotels, but Hermes Hotel gave us not only a great stay, but a great familiar environment. When you enter the Hotel, you receive smiles, the rooms are cozy, clean, comfortable ...even if they don麓t have a restaurant, the coffe and bread served home-style is surrounded by laughs, chating, and gigglings.It is a shame to know that the entrance has been blocked due to construction reasons, but eventhough, you should book the Hermes Hotel and you won麓t regret it. We really had a great time and a very enjoyable stay, and look forward to come back soon.

<Content>Great Experience We just returned from 3 days in Florence and the staff at Hotel Hermes made our stay very enjoyable. The hotel is centrally located, only 10-15 minute walk to almost any major attraction in the city. The owner pretty much mapped out our whole stay as well as suggested wonderful places to dine, which made our trip better than I could have imagined, and she was spot on with all her suggestions. If you are looking for a very reasonably priced hotel with clean rooms, free breakfast and a great staff...Hotel Hermes is the place. We made all our plans at info@hotelhermes.it

<Content>Perfect for Florence sightseeing We have stayed in Florence a couple of times and spent loads of money on hotels. We have walked the streets of Florence after a long train ride LOOKING for our hotel. This hotel provided basic 2 star requirements at a very affordable price, 1 minute walk from the train station. Easy access to anywhere in Florence, easy to catch a taxi, and easy to return to at any time of the day or night. There are 2 underground parking lots within a few feet of the front door of the hotel if you drive. The rooms were plain but very comfortable, quiet, and safe. Perfect if you plan on touring Florence and not spending your vacation in the hotel! There was a portable air conditioning unit next to the bed. As it was very hot in Florence, the AC was perfect...and cold!!! We came in late and the staff provided COLD beer, sodas and water for a nominal price at any time day or night. The staff members are all very friendly and helpful. English is not a problem. The owner provided us with directions, recommendations, and even made reservations for us at the 2 major museums (if you visit them, be sure to get the reservations). We will definitely stay there the next trip to Florence. Thank you Hotel Hermes!!!

<Content>Wonderful Stay! I had an amazing experience at Hotel hermes, located 7 minutes from Duomo and the heart of Florence. Run by an amazingly intelligent woman fluent in four languages, I was guided and counseled as to where to go , what to do, and how to get there. The hotel is incredibly clean, safe and AFFORDABLE. I cannot say enough good things about my experience there. if you are looking for an accommodation that offers affordability, expertise, great location and fluency in many languages then Hermes is the place for you. As a teacher, I was most appreciative of the good advice and counsel I received from owner, who actually works in her own hotel, day in and day out. The rooms are very well tended, simple and very clean.If I could give 6 stars to my experience, I would.John D USA

By sheer luck I spotted and chosed the Hermes, just opposite the railway station and competing with a lot of other hotels. The atmosphere was very friendly and I got everything I needed. I can highly recommend the hotel having as well a perfect situation for travelling as situated very well for the center of Florence.

<Content>Amo (Love) Hotel Hermes! Hotel Hermes is ideally located across the street from the train station (Santa Maria Novella) and down the street from the historic center of Florence. The Duomo (main cathedral) and the outdoor market at San Lorenzo are just down the street. The Ponte Vecchio (the old bridge), the Uffizi (art muesum) and the designer shops in Via Tournabouni are not much farther. Hermes is reasonably priced (remember, you are in Florence) and very clean. However, the service is what puts Hermes above the rest. The hotel owner is a remarkable woman whose knowledge of Florence will give you new insights into one of the most beautiful cities in the world. It is also convenient that her English and Spanish are perfect. Her French probably is too, but I don't speak French. Enjoy your stay! I always do!!
