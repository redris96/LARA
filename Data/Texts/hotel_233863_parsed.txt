<Content>Perfect Location Very nice Hotel for the price, breakfast is excellent, the only negative are the front desk employees, mostly quite rude and arrogant, they definetely need training in how to deal with the guests.

<Content>Ideal for a city break! This hotel is ideal if you are on a weekend to Berlin and just need somewhere to put your head down at night. Although basic, the rooms are large and clean. The hotel staff are efficient and friendly, always happy to help you with directions etc. The breakfast in the hotel is excellent, offering a wide selection of hot and cold food. We particularly liked the waffle machine for making our own waffles! In the hotel reception there are a various leaflets for all the sights of Berlin, and the zoo is only a 5 minute walk away. It's about a 10 minute walk to zoo station where you can get a train to all the main sights in the east and only takes about 10 minutes. Around the hotel itself there are plenty of bars and restaurants and the department store Ka DeWe is just around the corner, as well as many many other shops, and they were setting up the Christmas market as we were leaving.

<Content>Central,clean,comfortable with superb breakfast Stayed here in Standard double at the end of August with our four year old. A couple of minutes from the Wittenbergplatz U-Bahn,  5-10 minutes walk from Zoo' U-Bahn, with many restaurants, takeaways, cashpoint, late-night supermarket  market nearby.Found all reception staff very helpful and friendly. Room clean  comfortable with shower  bath,  curious double room door which provided good noise insulation. Bar was pricy, but with generous snack portions. Were able to check in over three hours early  leave luggage after checking out. Buffet breakfast was exceptional; vast choice of cereals ( seeds!), hot sausage, chicken, eggs  bacon, make your own waffles ( we did!), fruit salads, yoghurts, rolls, jams (in , pastries, cold meats, smoked salmon  cheeses, juices, teas  even Sekt in an ice bucket! Only quibble was that the (large) breakfast room was very busy between 8-9am (breakfast served 06.30-11.00hrs), and we had a few minutes delay finding a table  had to ask for a jug of coffee, but this is nitpicking, overall a comfortable place to recover from  set you up for more sightseeing.

<Content>Great hotel but beware, no A/C! Great hotel in excellent location near Kurferstendamm, KaDeWe, U-bahn, Zoo, and main train station. Only reason I haven't rated this hotel Excellent is because they don't have AC. If you're visiting during a cooler month, would highly recommend due it's central location, friendly staff, clean rooms and one of the best breakfast buffets we had in Germany. If you're visiting during a hot summer month, can't recommend this one. Staff was friendly and apologetic and offered us another fan - there was already one in the room - and gave us ice cubes. Couldn't sleep with window open due to the cigarette smoke that would fill up the room. Beer in the bar was 5 Euro, a bit high. Not the way we wanted to spend our last night in Germany - hot and sticky, but otherwise a great hotel. I'm amazed that in all the reviews I read on this hotel that no one mentioned no A/C. But at 95F days and 90F nights, A/C is just a must for us.

<Content>Nice, nice, nice Stayed at the Ambassador for two nights. We were greeted by very friendly and competent staff, who quickly got us through check-in. The room was not the largest, but very clean and well kept. Clean sheets every day and okay beds, though not perfectly comfortable. Nothing to worry about. I was impressed at how silent the area was at night even though it is located at the very center. Good possibilities for transportation nearby. Nice outside bar, though with a view of a parking lot behind bushes seperating the parking lot and the bar. Very good inside bar as well. No problems with noise from other rooms. Good for elderly people as well because of the lack of stairs. Very good breakfast. For the price, highly recommendable.

<Content>Great hotel Hotel was conveniently located steps from a subway station and key bus routes. Desk staff was friendly and very helpful at booking tours and providing directions. Only downside was lack of air conditioning in rooms, but in May, it was fine and could open windows to let cool air in when it got warm. Breakfast had a lot of variety and was very good! Would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Rooms fit for a youth hostel I checked tripadvisor before booking this. But ... where did these people stay? Certainly not in the room that we're in right now! Furniture with chipped off paint everywhere. A bis sticky spill of (I hope) Coke on the desk. There's a small door here with a tiny sticker saying: This door is locked, no minibar. hmmm. And I have not been able to locate the fridge with the free drinks. There's a coke vending machine by the lifet. Coke for 2 EUR. Certainly no free drinks. I still have the knob of the wardrobe door lying here next to ma computer. The toilet flush need lots of jiggling to stop flushing. The window opens fine but I had quite a task trying to get it back into its frame to close it again.Certainly not a hotel I would recommend. We're moving out tomorrow morning to find another hotel.

<Content>Great choice for older travelers I stayed 4 nights in early April at the Ambassador. I had a good quality room for the price: 20% discount for a 4-night stay, about 72.00/night USD for a single, including a huge and varied buffet in an attractive breakfast room each AM. A plus at breakfast--large carafes of hot coffee at each table.Just off the Ku-damm and the former middle of West Berlin, this hotel was perfect for the older traveler not looking for the nightlife of the Mitte, etc. It was close to U-Bahn, and an easy walk to Zoo train station and connections to the rest of Berlin and beyond.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Stayed here for a citybreak and it was excellent. Very easy to get to from the airport (bus to Zoo Station and then a short walk to the hotel). Very clean hotel and the staff were friendly and efficient.The brekfast was, as others have said, outstanding, much better than we have had in 5 star hotels.Easy to get everywhere, either on foot or my metro (station at end of road).All in all an excellent place to stay and we have booked to return in June.

Breakfast was very extensive and had something for everyone -- and it was included with the room too! Refrigerator on each floor stocked with complimentary beer, water, and Coke was a nice touch!

<Content>Great place to stay This is a great hotel to stay in. The hotel staff were very friendly and polite and always helpful. The breakfast buffet served almost everything you could want.The hotel is centrally located, taking only 2 minutes to walk to the KaDeWe (and the Kurfustendamn) and 5 minutes to the zoo. Would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definately book it again when returning to Berlin.

<Content>Brilliant Value - great hotel Booked here via Ryanair website - for absolute bargain price (i.e. 拢35 a night). Hotel is in good location right by U station and minutes away from main shops including KaDeWe (a must visit is the food halls).Hotel is contemporary (not very trendy though) and clean. Room was a good size, clean and with large bathroom. Proper double bed - not two singles pushed together. Everything in the room was good - only small niggles were the height of the shower (bit low for my 6ft 4 husband) and the TV reception was not great for CNN. No minibar but soft drinks available from machine in corridor.Hotel bar and reception was good - with friendly and helpful staff. Real plus was the great breakfasts - huge array of hot and cold buffett items... constantly replenished.We thought this hotel represented excellent value for money - would definately stay here again.

<Content>Great Location Shabby Room Although the Ambassador was well located,had a pleasant and helpful staff, and good food service, I will probably not stay there again. My single room was shabby with wallpaper peeling off the wall, a clean but threadbare carpet,and dated furniture. As a single traveller, I was only allowed one pillow on the double bed and one towel in the bath. The ventilation in the lobby was poor so the cigarette smoke was toxic.

<Content>A warming experience We鈥檝e recently returned from a weekend break in Berlin where we stayed at the Ambassador Hotel. This hotel doesn鈥檛 pull any punches but merely 鈥渄oes what it says on the tin.鈥?We arrived late Thursday evening and were ushered to our 鈥渟tandard double room鈥?only to find that it was actually a twin room. This coupled with the fact that the room was boiling hot and lacked air conditioning hardly made for a good first impression. After a rather sweaty night鈥檚 sleep I approached the concierge to enquire about changing rooms. They were only to happy to show me another room, which for an extra 15 euros per night gave me a double bed, a larger bathroom, bathrobes, a much needed fan and access to the complimentary drinks fridge in the hall. I duly accepted and it proved to be well worth the dosh.Breakfast was a hot/cold buffet open from 7-11am and was perfectly acceptable although a little tedious by the third day. The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and spoke superb English. Location wise the Ambassador hotel isn鈥檛 great. It鈥檚 situated near to the Zoologischer Garten station (similar to London鈥檚 King鈥檚 Cross) and isn鈥檛 really near the Mitte (the hub of Berlin life). This of course meant taking public transport which as you鈥檇 expect, is extremely punctual and efficient.Overall, we鈥檇 have to stay that this hotel serves a purpose but be warned there is no air conditioning and I would advise against staying here during the summer months.

<Content>Go there for breakfast We often stay in hotels in Berlin, most of the time 5 star hotels. On our way to Poland we stayed in Kempinski (terrible, see review). On our way back we stayed in this 3 star hotel and didn't expect that much. But we were surprised, the hotel is simple but nicely done (you don't need to spend much money to make something nice). The rooms are big for a 3 star hotel (certainly compared to a 5 star hotel like Kempinski) and are in a good condition. The only disadvantage is that when it is really hot , it can be very hot in the room because we didn't have airco (I don't know about other rooms). Breakfast was the biggest surprise. This can beat breakfasts in many 5 star hotels! Lots of choice, make your own pancakes, champaign, etc. We liked the variety of the people (compared to some other hotels) and in combination with the low price, the excellent breakfast and the central location, I would say 'check it out'.

<Content>Nice clean room but not very nice staff The hotel was typical business class Good: Great buffet and restaurant and good service/staff at the restaurant. Room was nice and clean.Bad: Some of the front desk staff were downright rude. There were a couple of nice ones though. The clientele were business people and vacationers on the conservative/rude side.Elevators were very slow.Very good: location to Ku'Damm, KaDeWe, gay district.The internet cafe across the street , staff was friendly and usage was cheap . Don't use the hotel's PCs for internet, they charge too much.There is a local restaurant two buildings up the street, the waitress and hosts are very nice and the food was very good, typical German. The market by park was also good. I won't stay here again due to the unfriendliness of the staff. Overall, i didn't care for Berlin as everything was spreadout, the people I encountered weren't very friendly. I cancelled Cologne to stay in Berlin for a couple of days more, I should have stuck to my original itinerary.

<Content>Low budget, clean Berlin hotel The Hotel Ambassador has a pleasant front desk staff and a good location (close to the Zoo, Tiergarten, the metro and buses), but it does not have the best rooms. They are very clean, but the decor is Stalin-esque and the beds were not comfortable. If you're traveling on a budget, this is a good hotel to consider just test your bed before accepting the room!

<Content>Excellent hotel - incredible value for money. Book there NOW!!! I ve stayed at the Ambassador Sorat Hotel in August 2006 for a 5-nights city break. I have only good things to say about the hotel (and the lovely city of Berlin - but thats somehow irrelevant I guess :-) First of all I got a great price of 72 euros/per night for a single room. My other options started at about 100 e+ and I seriously doubt they were any better. The location of the hotel is almost perfect. Its about 100m from a central U-bahn station (Wittenberg Platz) which serve 4 lines! The 'platz' itself is very nice and spacious with 4 'imbis' ( wurst stalls) at its 4 corners. I had a delicious curry-wurst every night on my way back to the hotel! The KaDeWe store is at the side of the square and Kurfurstendam with its loads of shops begins just 500m away.So, the location is very central, with very easy U-Bahn access and some sights right at your doorstep, like the KaDeWe and the Ruins of the bombarded church (cant remember the name right now). Also do try the wurst in the imbis you meet when exiting the station and going to the hotel! The room was very spacious (for european standards at least).It had a king size bed ( I guess it was really a double-bed ), it was very clean, had a mini-bar, big screen TV ( not the usual 14), nice ambient lighting, a sparkling clean bathroom with excellent shower water presure. One thing that I ve never met before was the fact that it had double doors! There was an outer standard door with the lock and then another one with no lock. The double doors worked very well in blocking noise from the hallways. I really liked that feature. The only thing missing from the room was air-conditioning. I think there are ACs in the more premium rooms, but mine being a basic standard one, lacked it. However that didnt turn out to be much of a problem since the weather was cool enough, even in the middle of August, that I didnt really miss it at all. And I m someone who normally has the AC working 24/7 during the summer, but in Berlin there was no need for it. The staff was friendly enough and replied to my requests. The breakfast was good, although nothing really special.Overall it was a great experience and I ll defenitely stay there again, should I return to Berlin.

<Content>Very nice hotel Spent three nights at the Ambassador. It is in a prime locaton for shopping. It is an older hotel, so don't expect a fancy 21st century property. You get a clean nice room, good TV, nice bath. The hotel has double doors leading into the room, so you get less noise from the hallway, saying that however, I heard no noise from the hallway at anytime. The lobby is very nice, and the staff helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast in the morning is fantastic, one of the best I have seen. Large breakfast room looking out on the passing street scene. If I go back to Berlin I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Good value; excellent location Stayed there a year or two back for four nights. Location is excellent - in a quiet sidestreet but very convenient for what I wanted. Just off Kurfurstendamm Strasse, within 3 minutes of Ka-De-We, within five mins of nearest S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations. Hotel was clean and staff were friendly and helpful enough. Breakfast buffet was good and plentiful. We ate out for other meals so don't know what they were like - there were a load of restaurants within a few minutes walk. Would be happy to stay here again.
