<Content>Great Location but over inflated prices Originally booked in sister hotel the Meritus Mandarin on Orchard Road but their pool was closed for renovation. Have stayed in Marina Mandarin a few times on business so knew it was in a great location - very central for a number of attractions and for the shopping but did not anticipate the high prices they were charging even taking into account the xmas and new year period. Facilities are great although rooms smaller than I'd expect for a hotel of this price in this part of the world and in-room facilities are spartan in comparison to other chains. Breakfast buffet is reminiscent of feeding time at the zoo when the hotel is at full capacity as it was during my stay. Such a crush of people meant long queues, a constant lack of something on the buffet table and poor service. Calls to the service desk on this issue went unanswered.Staff are friendly and everything works - the hotel does however lack a real identity but given the high turnover of folk and the size of the place, this is to be expected. Good access to malls/entertainment/MRT/taxis and overall a good hotel althouigh if I were staying again I have decided to stay in the suburbs, save at least $100 per night on room price, commute instead by taxi into town and have an additional $100 to spend on goodies.

<Content>Fantastic hotel The location is ideal for anybody wishing to explore Singapore and only has a short amount of time. Walking distance to the underground station, Raffles, water front and Singapore Flyer (similar but I think bigger than the London eye) I would recommend the night safari, its superb. We could not fault the hotel really, the staff, rooms, location etc were all excellent. The lobby is awsome.As some reviews have said its alittle on the expensive side. I agree that drinks and food at the hotel bar are rather expensive however a nice experience. If you want cheaper drinks there is an Irish bar about five minutes walk away.As far as the hotel in general goes I think you get what you pay for in this instance, well worth the money.

<Content>Excellent, Great location, good rooms, and food and service was good. I like to try and fault city 5 star hotels, but I really couldn't with this one. The hotel has a wonderful atmosphere, great location, large refurbished rooms, big balcony, great views, good service and food. For a tourist trip to Singapore this hotel is in a great spot, walking distance from almost everything and next to a shopping mall. Will definitely be staying here again next time I m in Singapore. Advice: Try and get a room facing the city with view. Downfall:Pool could to with a make-overDan

<Content>nice but very expensive!!! we arrived from a lovely stay at Phuket and had to wait over 2hrs for a room which when we got to it it wasnt the right style that we requested.We were told that there werent any of the marina bay view.I told them that was what we had booked in feb 10 months ago and we wanted as paperwork stated.After further disscussions on the phone we were taken to room 1033.Whilst we had to wait for the wrong room we had a triple sandwich and my hubby four tiny squares of pate and 2 lattes which cost around 拢30 which was far from reasonable for the size of the portion.Had we not had to wait longer than normal for the room we wouldnt have had to pay this price for lunch and gone out to find something more value for money,we dont mind paying for an evening meal but not a light lunch.Lovely hotel but go out for food and drink if at the end of your holiday!!

<Content>Wonderful Singapore!! Possibly the best hotel we have ever stayed in!! Here for 2 nights on stopover to New Zealand. Special cheap rates and airport transfers free with Singapore Airlines. It is an excellent position for walking to Raffles(10 mins) and the shops. Suntec shopping center directly opposite which held shops of every description as well as excellent restaurants and small pods where they cooked oriental snacks in front of you.We ate from these pods twice and would definately recommend.On way back stopped in different area known as riverside ok but not so good as this part of Singapore. Will return!!

The transfer was seamless and even taking us to our room bypassing reception was gratefully received. The hotel was spotless the service perfection.The room was excellant and breakfast interesting. The view over towards the Lion and the esplanade from the balcony was great. Access to the MRT was airconditioned and a welcome relief from the humidity of Singapore. For a central hotel this hotel will take some beating.

<Content>Great hotel but... I recently travelled to Singapore and booked the Marina Mandarin for 4 nights. So... it is a very nice hotel, very nicely appointed, each room has a nice balcony. No problem with noise as mentioned in earlier reviews. Pool is nice and I would compare it to a Marriott by North American standards. The patio is nice on every room and offers nice views of Singapore. I would definitely recommend this hotel however, I also stayed 1 night at the Pan Pacific Hotel for about the same price. If I were to return to Singapore I would stay at the Pan Pacific (Which is right across the street from the Marina Mandarin). Here is a tip for drinkers. Go to the 7-11 and buy your drinks and alcohol. It's right across the street and a quarter of the price. Hotels in Singapore have ridiculously expensive beer and wine, espescially in the hotels. If your looking for a good bar then the CasaBlanca is a nice bar with two for one drinks and a great patio.

The Meritus club has complimentary snacks all day, free cocktails after 5 and a huge breakfast to chose from. The room was very impressve with a large plasma tv, huge bed and great bathroom. The staff are very friendly and helpful and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. I would definatley go back and stay at the Marina Mandarin hotel!

<Content>seriously good my wife and i had three nights at this great hotel. the hotel stands alongside its sister the mandarin singapore and the marina shopping mall and faces out onto marina bay. on getting to the hotel you are immediately impressed by the building,you are greeted by the concierges staff and whisked upto the 4th floor reception area, the first thing you see is the awsome atrium soaring 22 stories above you,the ckeck-in is very quick and you are in your rooms in moments,we arrived at 6-30 am and our room was ready,the hotel facilities from the 5th fllor swimming pool to any one of 4 restaurants and numerous bars are impressive. the staff cannot do enough for you. the hotel is within walking distance of the major attractions of the singapore flyer,boat quay,clarke quay and raffles hotel, we highly recommend the marina mandarin

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Marina Mandarin on our way to Bali. The hotel was superb and all you would expect from a 5 star establishment. The location is also perfect for all that Singapore can offer.The only downside was the view. We were on the 10th floor facing towards Singapores version of the London eye, which is lovely. However the marina is currently undergoing massive construction work which is due to be completed in 2010. The cranes and floodligting dominate the view from this side of the hotel so try and get a view across the city and Esplande.This is not the hotels fault but if you want a view of Singapore the Marina view is probably not the best example.

The location of the hotel is great with many shopping places close by. The room was very clean and the hotel fittings were excellent. The ambiance of the hotel lobby was very good with a singer and pianist playing one night. It is a great place to stay for business or shopping or just touring the city.

<Content>Great Location We spent 3 nights at this hotel on our way to Australia. We arrived at 9.25am and the staff made every effort to have our room ready by 10.am. Only niggle would be that we weren't offered a complimentary tea or coffee on our arrival. That would have been most appreciated. Never mind. We paid for a late checkout which was actually extended until 10 minutes before we were due to leave the hotel. Our room was on the 10th floor with views over the marina. It was spotlessly clean and towels and sheets changed daily. Breakfast was not included in our package and we paid 拢16 per person plus a 20% service charge which we thought quite expensive. However breakfast was good and service was excellent. The hotel is in an excellent location for the Singapore Flyer,and for shopping and restaurants.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel for a stop-over in Singapore.

<Content>Gorgeous! We only stayed at the Mandarin for a couple of nights, on our way to Australia, but really wished we had more time there. The total experience, from when you arrive at the entrance, was fantastic. From the outside the hotel is nothing special to look at, but once you step inside the doors ... wow! Beautiful surroundings, wonderful service, usually by the most gorgeous Chinese girls. The room was fantastic and food in the restaurant couldn't be faulted. We thought the value for money was fantastic, especially compared to what we paid for a room in New York on our way home!

We stayed on one of the club level floors which allows you to have free drinks and canopes every evening from 5pm to 7.30pm and our room was beautiful. The hotel itself leads directly into one of the shopping malls in the suntect city area. The staff at the pool are excellent, extremely nice and helpful. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel, good location, too noisy! This is a nice hotel and staff are well trained. There are positives and negatives which make this hotel below average.Positives:Connected to Marina Square shopping centre, easy walk to citylink mall through to city hall MRT and Raffles Shopping Centre.Rooms are modern, however bathroom maintenance needs a little work. Excellent cleanliness.Staff are well trained and very friendly.Breakfast was very good.Negatives:The hotel is an atrium and the result is noise being carried. The hotel could very simply solve this by improving the sound proofing. We were on a high floor and could hear the band and lounge patrons 10 or so floors below till the early hours of the morning.Additionally, the noise from the street and pool is also very loud.Bathroom maintenance needs to be improved. Overall this hotel is good for business travellers mostly who work in Raffles Link or are in Singapore for a quick stop and do not want to venture to busy Orchard Road and happy to stick to one shopping centre with several restaurants and all major shopping chains.

<Content>Too noisy for us. We are currently staying in one of the Meritus Club Suites which is very nice, but it is so noisy. This is not through any fault of the hotel, but due to the building work going on outside the hotel. There is the constant noise of jackhammering and every single day without fail there has been a practice session for the Singapore National Day which is in August apparently. We are on the 21st Floor facing the harbour and we can hear it word for word, plus the brass bands and all the singing. Its driving us crazy. As an example, it has just turned 9a.m. here and we can hear some woman on a microphone saying check 1, 2 check 1, 2 . NOT what I want to be woken up by. Even as you sit by the pool at times, you are drowned out by the noise (through your iPod no less).The hotel check in was efficient and pleasant and the staff very nice, however the hours for breakfast are a little short, especially if you are staying in the Club suites, breakfast ends at 10a.m., which if you are jet lagged like we currently are, its hard to haul yourself out of bed and be ready by 9a.m. (they start clearing up at 9:45a.m. and ask you to fill your plate so that they can finish).The food is the major disappointment. For the LHW Hotel we expected better food as we have stayed in many hotels belonging to this group before and the food has been outstanding. The room service menu is ordinary and the restaurants are average when compared to the others in the area. The buffet in the Aquamarine is nice at lunch, but its virtually identical at dinner which is a shame. On a positive note, the bird songs during the day is beautiful as they have the birds around the atrium and the nearby shopping is easy to get walk to.Travelling into Orchard Road takes about 15 minutes and costs between $7 and $9.Would we stay here again, no. Obviously the noise is not the fault of the hotel, they cannot help the massive building work happening in the harbour, nor can they be held responsible for the rehearsals for the National Day, but frankly its been a pain in the neck and I feel resentful at paying these prices and then having dreadful nights sleep and not being able to relax in the room due to the noise. Perhaps you just have to accept that in Singapore noise comes with the territory, and then some. Also the food simply isn't up to scratch. They need to improve this tremendously if they want to compete with the other hotels in the area.

<Content>great start to our honeymoon ! We stayed for the first 2 ngts of our honeymoon in April 08. This is a superb hotel, we arrived at 6am after our flight from the U.K, check in was very swift  we were in our room within 10 mins. The room was great, clean  spacious with huge bed, plasma t.v on the wall, complimentary water, tea / coffee making facilities  a fab bathroom. The hotel itself is very impresive with a big reception area / lovely plush bar area's (prepare to dig deep into your pockets though if drinking there !)  a fantasic pool, great for a refreshing evening swim after being out in the humidity  heat. The service in the hotel was outstanding, you could call housekeeping to arrange what time is conveneint for your room to be made up, we were able to check in at 6am with no problems, we were also asked what time we would like to check out on the day we left so there was not the usual problem of having to be out of the room for mid day then hanging around waiting to be picked up. Singapore itself just blew us away, its an awsome place, so clean, civilised  ordered (without feeling like you are being policed) when we were there they were just starting work on the marina area for the Grand Prix, we commented how the traffic  public transport etc still ran like clockwork ! We stayed here on our way to Bali  said if we ever visit that part of the world again we would most definitley choose singapore as a stopover  would not hesitate to consider at this hotel again.

The staff was so helpful with places to eat and shopping directions. The hotel is right next to Marina Square and Suntec so you can easily walk to the mall. Eating around is very easy although I found the food (in singapore)generally speaking very expensive than say, Bangkok or Manila. In the afternoon, they turn down the beds and put some candies on your bed...Excellent Hotel

<Content>Only one night Had a night to stay in Singapore on the way back to UK.Went into the tourist services place at the arrivals hall in terminal 1 and they gave me a list of hotels. They said there was a special offer at the Mandarin for about 拢140 / night. About 20 minute taxi ride from the airport.Very nice looking hotel. 21 floors with the atrium going full heigth inside the building (as a builder always thought this was a bit of a waste of good construction space). Very good view from the 21 st floor looking down inside to the reception area.Didn't try too many of the hotel facilities as I was only there for 1 night. However, the service was good, the room was clean and tidy, and of a good size. Only draw back was that I was on the 6th floor, so the view outside was limited.Overall an excellent hotel for a reasonable price

<Content>First Class Marina Mandarin! We spent a week at the Marina Mandarin and could fault nothing! The hospitality was second to none. We chose to upgrade to the Club Room and this is well worth the extra cash if you enjoy a bit of exclusivity. The Meritus Club served a fabulous healthy breakfast and cocktails from 5.30pm to 7.30pm every evening (real Champagne and as much as you like!). We also took advantage of the 2 items of laundry done complimentary each day. The location is fantastic as everything is within easy reach. Marina Bay is probably a bit quieter than Orchard Road but this suited us. There was still plenty to see and do and even an Irish pub below our hotel! The hotel bar itself was a great place to end the evening and we did try the Peach Blossom Cantonese restaurant which was excellent but to be honest there is so much choice outside of the hotel it's not necessary to go to the extra expense of eating in. Fabulous pool area and great air conditioned gym. Our room was spotless and cleaned very quickly every morning. All in all this is a great hotel with staff who cannot do enough for you so I would highly recommend it for business or pleasure!

<Content>Fantastic hotel! We visited the Marina Mandarin for two nights in March 2008 on our way to Australia. After a long flight, we arrived at the Marina Mandarin and from the moment we arrived our whole experience could not have been better. Staff were fantastic with impecable service ranging from the concierge to the receptionist. They could not do enough to make our stay more enjoyable and made our children feel very welcome. Facilities were equally impressive, with two matching connecting rooms(family room), which were well presented and clean with fantastic bathrooms.Pool was beautiful with very helpful staff who ensured you enjoyed every minute of your time. Glass lifts were super quick and efficient. The atrium is amazing with the sounds of birds singing, which we loved. Breakfast was excellent with a beautiful area for dining outside. We cannot wait to stay there again.

<Content>Not the most welcoming We stayed for 4 nights in early April with our 3 year old daughter. The room was spacious and clean, but the hotel is not really suitable for families with young children. We found it too 'clinical' and in the very quiet atmosphere, our daughter's excited behaviour was frowned upon. Constantly felt that we had to make sure she was being a 'perfect child'. This hotel is OK if you are staying on business, and although a great location for sightseeing, not for young families. Disappointed as this was an expensive hotel

<Content>Really disappointing Request for a high floor room was ignored. Single glazed windows meant that we had unacceptable levels of traffic noise. Added to this was a really annoying water hammer from the plumbing, making sleep almost impossible. Room rate (GBP 150 per night) did not include breakfast. Carpet in room was covered in stains. Receptionist did not tell us about using the key card to operate the lift. Not a good experience. I am a regular visitor to Singapore and I've stayed in much better hotels - for less money.

Breakfast was buffet style and would satisfy the fussiest of eaters - the range of multi-cultural foods was amazing!The swimming pool was fantastic and very exotic! A welcome relief from the heat/humidity of Singapore.We were fairly central to most activities and sightseeing locations. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Marina Mandarin

<Content>Lovely - (and a pink Xmas Tree as well !!) Stopped off at this hotel for 3 nights en route to Australia. Was recommended by our travel agent and a good value deal to boot.We stayed in an Executive floor room. Theseoccupy the top 2 floors of the hotel. Separate check-in desk at Reception followed an individual guided tour of facilities by a member of staff dressed in traditional Singapore dress. Nice touch ! Breakfast served in an exclusive room on the floor itself. Also evening drinks and snacks served between 5pm to 8pm. Light refeshments available at any time of day up to 10pm.Rooms were spacious with lovely amenities. Large LCD TV and usual branded toiletries in a well laid out bathroom.Free internet access also available in the Exec lounge to catch up on home news, check-in for next flight and so on.The hotel is situated directly opposite the Convention Centre whcih hosts all sorts of exhibitions. Flower show and a Sony exhibiton were on when we were there. Also within the Centre is the Hippo Bus Tour terminus. The daily tourist bus that gides you round the city. Great value for a ticket that lasts for 48 hours. Interconnected to the Centre and the Hotel is a huge shopping complex with every type of shop imginable. It also leads into Singapore's unique underground warren of tunnels between buildings. Great to get out of the humid atmosphere outside.For first time visitors (as we were), the hotel is also only a 5-10 minute walk from Raffles Hotel. An absolute 'must visit' to sample the delights of the original birth place of the Singapore Sling in the Long Bar. These poor guys that work there have the patience of saints with all the questions they are asked about the drink but they do it with courteousness and a smile on their face. An experience not to be missed.

<Content>Love this hotel I have stayed at the Marina Mandarin several times now and it gets better everytime. It has the most amazing swimming pool ever, and half the pool is quite shallow so it's great for my 9 year old to be able to stay in the 'adult's' pool!! The rooms are big, beautiful and clean and the atrium lobby is amazing.The only flaw this hotel has is the price of the breakfast, I wish they would make it a little cheaper, but nevermind, the hotel is attached to one of the biggest malls in singapore which has several breakfast restaurants including mcdonalds.

<Content>Far too noisy We stayed at The Marina Mandarin for two nights on the way back home from Australia. We were definitely disappointed. The staff on Reception were indifferent, apart from one lady who I dealt with later and who was charming. I explained that our onward flight was to be late in the evening - and was not initially invited to have a later check-out time and make use of the pool facilities (although the pleasant lady I spoke to later informed me that we were welcome to use these facilities). Our room was clean, the bathroom was fine, but at night the room was very noisy - we were in the front of the hotel and the traffic noise from the road 10 storeys below was horrendous, and this was all night - no double glazing at all. Other people complained about the noise from the Atrium - we could hardly hear it for the traffic noise. The bed was extremely hard and the pillows were like sleeping on bricks! Had we been staying longer I would have asked for a different room. Housekeeping and the Concierge were unobtainable on the phone. The Executive Suite was easily accessible, and open 24 hours, but the computers were down when I was there and remained so for the two days we were there - however, I was able to use one of the staff's computer.Breakfast was very good, but the ambience in the Aqua Marina restaurant was nothing to write home about. The pool area was a welcome haven, and the staff there were extremely friendly and helpful - that was the best bit of the hotel in my opinion.The hotel was potentially lovely, what a shame there were so many problems.

<Content>I'm giving you a warning NOT TO STAY in this Hotel The airport concierge book this hotel for meThe rooms are nice and cleanThe amenities are goodThe food/restaurant are exquisite and great tasteThe room rate - too pricey SGD $220so whats the problem? the STAFF at the reception and concierge!Imagine it took them 30minutes to check me in then the concierge are so lazy and picky they are moving very slow and don't want to help you with your luggage. Imagine, when I checked out it look them 30 minutes to arrive to my room then the concierge deliberately didn't bring a trolley even when I specifically told them to bring one as I had 4 luggages then the concierge Mr. SARAN ordered me to carry the other bags as he only had 2 hands. What kind of staff is that?? I wrote the hotel manager and told him about my mad experience but they never wrote back not even to offer any apology thats how arrogant this hotel is.I WILL NEVER STAY IN THIS HOTEL!! If you want to get value for your money DO NOT STAY in this hotel, its like staying in a 1-star or no-star hotel at all, the service is very very lousy! I hope this hotel group closes down!!! Even their sister hotel MERCHANT COURT and STAMFORD also the same lousy service!!!

<Content>Cool interior Sorry for the pun ... the interior of this hotel is a huge atrium. It also keeps the whole hotel lovely and cool.Some previous reviewers have complained about noise. I stayed at the hotel for a week and I found it very peaceful. The beds are situated by the windows rather than by the door, and on the one occasion I went to bed early, I really couldn't hear the music drifting up from the atrium. Maybe they've listened to previous comments and reduced the volume.I've been to Singapore many times and always like to stay in a 5-star hotel, as it's an affordable luxury. Unlike Europe where I live. Previously I've stayed at The Fullerton (lovely, but it's now very expensive; not the S$250 it was a couple of years ago) and Raffles The Plaza (great location above the MRT station, but impersonal and dull. Now called The Fairmont).Marina Mandarin's main advantage is its uniqueness. The atrium is lovely, and it feels great walking out of your room - none of that dark-corridor-in-a-non-descript-hotel stuff. The breakfast was good and the service very friendly. The rooms spotless and well equipped.The only downside is the distance from the MRT. Taxis are cheap, but as a single traveller I usually enjoy (honest!) using public transport. The walk from the hotel to City Hall MRT, whilst all underground, gets tedious rather quickly. That could be because I spent a week there. One or two days and it's a novelty. Maybe.Don't be put off though - I don't like staying near Orchard Road and much prefer the location of this hotel (and the others I mentioned above), and the walk from the MRT is through shopping centres so you can wheel your luggage most of the way.If the price of this hotel is no more than The Fairmont, or even the Swissotel (which seems oddly expensive now) then stay at the Marina Mandarin. It's got all the comforts of a chain 5-star hotel with that unique atrium. It may not sound like much, but it does make a difference.

<Content>Where is that twittering coming from? My husband and I stayed in the Marina Mandarin on our way to New Zealand on honeymoon. The hotel is very impressive the lobby and entrance area is stunning.Our first night we had 2 single beds pushed together I wasn't too impressed considering we were on our honeymoon and they new that. I requested a new room the next day and in fairness to them we got it. Both rooms were spotless and the bathroom was huge with double sinks and separate shower and bath.There was a piano bar in the lobby area and the design of the hotel ensured that the music travelled up to all the rooms. We were pretty tired and I wasn't too happy to hear that in our room. The next morning I could hear birds twittering constanly. And while sleeping thinking there must be so many birds in this city. It turned out to be a recording of birds being played all day, very annoying.The pool area was beautiful well worth a visit. We had food in the hotel it was not too good, there are several choices though.I was a bit put off also by the fact that staff only seemed to want to deal with my husband even though everything was booked in the lead name as in me.

<Content>Average, slightly tired rooms, service way below average Stayed there for three days and would not stay there again.The check-in / back office was not up to five star standard. Besides we got a rate that included two breakfasts for a double the hotel claimed that there was only one breakfast included in the rate for a double room (???). Instead of clarifying that with agent (HRS) directly the staff at the check-in pointed out that they have a policy of not contacting travel agents directly! (After long discussions and contacting HRS the breakfast was included in the room rate).I do not consider this kind of behaviour customer oriented and also this way of dealing with problems can only be considered inadequate. The staff at check-in can not be considered friendly and had a tendency towards arrogance. The rooms were slightly tired and a bit old fashioned and there was also mould in the shower, thus the rooms and the cleaning are obviously not up to 5 star standard.Fortunately there was a separate bath tub which was ok.As some reviews have pointed out already that due to the accoustics in the atrium and the thin doors/walls the bird songs/sounds will be clearly audible in your room in the morning. Breakfast buffet was good and offered a wide selection.The concierge was a positive exception and was helpful and efficient in organising transportation to Johor Bahru. Overall the price/performance ratio and the service of the Marina Mandarin could be improved considerably.

<Content>Great atmosphere Stayed here for 4 nights. 2 nights at standard room and 2 nights at the club roomLocation wise is great. At the shopping centre and convention centre next door and within walking distance to the subway.I like its architecture. It has a volumous interior which gives good resonance in the evening when there is a band signing. Really nice ambience for a drink in the evening. During the day, there are ral birds singing near the chinese restaurants. I think this is the best thing i like about the hotel. Check in was good. Must congratulate Josephine who is exceptionally courteous and helpful.The staff are quite attentive also.Standard rooms are spacious but look plain. Other than that it is reasonable.Club rooms are much more luxurious with good coimplimentary bottled water (still and sparkling) and a fine selection of gourmet coffee. Breakfast at the club floor has a nice view but food is more limited compared to the restaurant where other people (non club floor) goes too.The hotel is not new and shows signs of aging but is nicely refurbished.Club room, although nicely decorated and designed, feels small and cluttered. But the free gourmet coffee, sparkling water and CrabtreeEvelyn toileteries make up for it..Overall, a very good hotel. I won't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Business traveller review I stayed at the Marina Mandarin for 3 nights, and took part in a business function in one of the Vanda meeting rooms, which are on the sixth floor of the hotel.Where the hotel excelled:1. All hotel staff were extremely friendly and notably polite. They spoke excellent English, and offered help before being asked.2. This hotel has the best bellmen I have ever encountered. I didn鈥檛 have to carry my own bags at any point 鈥?a real treat for a weary business traveller.3. The hotel is centrally located in downtown Singapore. Getting around was very easy 鈥?especially on foot. 4. The hotel has several different restaurants - Chinese, Italian and seafood. The food and service were above average in each one.5. Cabled web access was available in the hotel rooms, for a fee.6. The rooms were clean and quite spacious.7. The atmosphere and d茅cor of the hotel are striking 鈥?22 storeys of rooms are situated around a massive open atrium that is topped with a glass skylight roof. On the fifth floor, unusual tropical birds are kept in brass cages. Their calls can be heard throughout the hotel during the daylight hours. On the fourth floor, the large bar area in front of the reception desk includes space for musicians and performers. I heard several talented singers, pianists and violinists each night I was there.Things that could be improved:1. Signage was a problem. Except for in-room literature, the only indication of locations for restaurants, meeting rooms or hotel amenities was written in small, hard-to-read script next to the floor selection buttons on the panel in the elevator.2. The temperature in our meeting room was appropriate for hanging a side of beef. Despite repeated, well-intentioned attempts by hotel staff to adjust the room to a warmer temperature setting, we continued to be uncomfortably cold. (I suspect part of the problem is the location of the thermostat/heat sensor. It is set way too high on the wall 鈥?just below the ceiling. This is probably unnecessary in a facility that is used exclusively by adults.)Things that were unacceptable: Nothing was unacceptable about this hotel 鈥?it is pretty spectacular.Bottom line:This is an above-average hotel with superior staff and world-class ambiance. This was my second stay there, and the Marina Mandarin lived up to my wonderful memories of the place.My recommendation:Business travellers can book there with every confidence and look forward to an enjoyable stay.

<Content>Marina Mandarin - great Singapore Stopover My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at this hotel (Singapore stopover) in September 2007. Not having stayed in Singapore before, we were pleasantly surprised. This was a beautiful hotel - the atrium foyer was spectacular - we were upgraded to an executive room on arrival - which was very spacious. The staff were very welcoming, friendly and obliging (eg: we just enquired to where Raffles Hotel was as we wanted to try the famous afternoon tea and Singapore Sling (as it turned out just a 5 minute stroll around the corner), the concierge staff gave us the directions and even rang to make the booking for us! The breakfast buffet at the Marina Mandarin was very extensive and high quality food. It really is the little things that make a big difference - and the staff made us feel very special indeed. We wished we could have stayed another couple of days! We will definitely stay at the Marina Mandarin again next time we are in Singapore.

<Content>good but a bit random I couldn't decide if to give three or four stars, I believe it claims to a six star hotel (whatever that actually is) and well that its definintely not.We had a one night stay on the club floor for our wedding anniversary, Carlo the chef at their upmarket Itlanian restaurant having run the restaurant at Sheraton where we had wedding reception way back when.Service was decidedly mixed overall with the Filipino and local staff were good (some very good) but the others mainland Chinese et al were somewhere between average and I get better in my local coffee shop - and they speak better english. If you are a six star hotel your club lounge staff need to be able to communicate in the main international business language - that's just the way it is.Generally speaking the reception etc staff were good to very good, while the FB staff seemed largely untrained and vaguely hopeless (a huge contrast). Breakfast in the club lounge verged on laughable with a woman cooking eggs etc who had obviously been hired from the local hawker centre (although that is an insult to my local joint). Thick as two short planks is an understatement.The rest of the FB service was average as well, excepting the manager(?) and Carlo in Risortante Bologna.The room was really nice, and a way cool shower. However rock hard pillows did litlle for actually sleeping. The aircon was very warm with no apparent way of turning up the fan, and the absurb number of unlabled light switches was just plain irritating.Overall - nice rooms, some very good staff - and if they could iron out the kinks would be a great hotel - but at what we paid average for the price.

<Content>Beware I chose to end my South East Asian holiday in what i thought would be a 5 start hotel in Singapore(2930 Sept 07) I booked through Asia Rooms whose bookings nowdays seem to be on an unrefundable basis, which leaves little leeway if your hotel turns out to be a loser.On checking in i was placed in a room on the 10th floor........it was a dump! The entire room was old and tired with much of the furniture having stains on it.........not what one would expect from a 5 star hotel. I asked to be shifted as i did not want a room with an interconnecting door..................I was moved 5 rooms down and the decor was no better!!!!! and whilst it was a non-smoking room, i discovered a full ashtray out on the balcony that looked liked it have been there for several days!......Shows how well these rooms were being cleaned. The fact was both rooms felt old dirty and tired! I had had enough and at this point in a normal stay I would have checked out and gone accross the street to the Oriental but because I had used Asia Rooms i would lose my money.......so i upgraded for a further $50.00 a night ........The end result was basically the same room tarted up with a cheap renovation!To top things off i caught a bad ear infection from their poolMy advice if you are thinking of staying at this Hotel? don't ......It just doesnt have any class its a 2 star hotel with the outward trappings of a 5 star........It looks tempting but if you want a real 5 start hotel go for one of the major brands at least you will get value.

<Content>Fine but not stunning As a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 children, we stayed for 4 nights in 2 connecting rooms in August 2007.The hotel was fine - very clean, all the facilities we wanted / needed, and thanks to prompt e-mail communication before we travelled, I was confident that we would get the important connecting rooms (always a worry when you have booked 2 rooms with children). I would say not a five star though - maybe 4?We checked in without any problems, had some delays in getting the connecting doors opened, and an issue with power to one of trooms, but that was soon sorted out.We arrived on a Sunday evening, tired and hungry and were disappointed that there was no 'casual' dining available in the hotel - only lobby bar snacks, or one expensive more upmarket restaurant was open.We went into the adjoining shopping centre (bit like 'Mr Ben' - go through a door in the hotel and you're right in the middle of a huge mall!) but sadly everywhere except McDonalds or Starbucks closed at 10pm on Sunday! This is obviously not the hotel's fault, but just a warning to other people arriving at this time.The breakfasts were fine - a bit busy due to the number of conferences in the hotel, but food good and varied.The gym was good, and the outdoor pool very welcome after sightseeing. Pool service (drinks, food) was also very attentive.The location was ideal for conference goers / shoppers wanting to be virtually in a mall, and also very close to Raffles (we had drinks in the Long Bar with our 2 children - definitely recommended) but we would have preferred a location nearer to some more restaurants (wish I had taken another posters advice to stay at Swissotel Clarke Quay! Lots more bars and restaurants there).Apart from location not being the best for what we wanted, the 2 negatives of the hotel in my opinion were as previously mentioned by other reviewers:1. Caged birds 'tweeting' in he huge atrium lobby - seemed very cruel2. Lobby music - piano / violin etc - not unpleasant music, but went on well past midnight, and made it difficult for our children to sleep. The design of the hotel is such that you could hear the music right up to the top rooms.I probably wouldn't stay there again, there are many good hotels in Singapore, but to be honest we found 3 full days in Singapore to be sufficient for us, and were ready to go on to Thailand at the end of our stay.

I was apprehensive having read the recent poor reviews. However, our stay could not have been more pleasant. Staff were very accomodating, all our requests ie non smoking, interconnecting rooms on quiet floor etc were all met. The breakfast was great - fine selection of items, the hotel was clean, facilities great and could not fault staff. All in all a great stop over and would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Meritus Club rooms are great if you get a deal We booked a total of four nights at the Marina Mandarin in June 2007 via Travelocity...we got an incredible deal on a Meritus Club Suite (and I mean incredible...we paid less than half the list price of a regular run-of-the-mill room for a Club Suite, probably through some typo in the Travelocity system, but I am not complaining!!). So the level of service we experienced may have been different than the norm, as we were immediately handled as VIPs, especially during our second two-day stay, which was viewed as a return visit. I can say that the Meritus Club facilities and rooms were really, really nice - updated modern furnishings, spacious, great bathrooms, extras in room like espresso maker, wonderful toilitries, etc. Suite was lovely and probably worth the list price (free internet, but charged for local calls, which is sort of weird, but you also have free access to a business center and concierge as a Meritus Club guest). Breakfasts and cocktail hours included with Club-level accommodations (not just suites, but Club regular rooms, too) were great -- everything included, a good variety of food, attentive service. Evening cocktails have themed appetizers, nice way to start your evening out. Club dining area was never crowded at all. If you're going to pay list price, pay the extra for a Meritus Club room and you are unlikely to be disappointed. I cannot speak to the regular rooms as I did not see any, and I did not attend the hotel-wide breakfasts.Design of the hotel is impressive -- atrium and lobby bars are cool. Yes, smoking in the lobby is a problem, and drinks there are outrageous, so I recommend avoiding (in general, the food at the hotel was preposterously priced...why eat there when you are spoilt for choice for cheap food in Singapore? Walk across the street to Satay Club or any hawker food court!) I think that this is the case in most Singaporean hotels -- it's not a cheap place for hotels and luxury amenities.Location....I will say that the area is probably ideal for conventioneers, and is a BIT out of the way for the tourist. It's about a 10-15-minute walk to the City Hall MRT station via air-conditioned mall...not an unpleasant walk, but not the shortest possible (the new Raffles City hotel, formerly the Westin, is right on top of the City Hall station, for example). Could be more convenient. Is convenient via taxi to the airport and the not-to-be-missed East Coast Seafood Centre, as East Coast Parkway feeds right into the marina area, so it's a straight shot. Walkable to Raffles, Chijmes, etc. If you plan on spending a lot of time in the Orchard area, that is probably a better hotel hub for you than the Marina.Staff at desk and downstairs at drop-off were fine. Housekeeping did a good job in our room. I think the review below is a little absurd -- illegal immigrants from rogue states? In Singapore? Are we takling about the same autoritarian capitalist country here? Unlikely to be allowed or tolerated, sorry....many workers on the island are legal temporary workers from other SE Asian countries and yes, they have lower English levels than the average Singaporean...so please call the front desk if you're having trouble communicating instead of demanding things, then insulting a hardworking person.

<Content>Disappointed I travel quite often to Singapore, and recently, I tried staying at Marina Mandarin Hotel - Marina Bay, Singapore. One of the reasons was its proximity to the SUNTEC CITY Convention Centre, as me and my colleagues were attending SOA  ECM Day Conferences there..When I first checked in, it was to my (unpleasant) surprise that the room wasn't tidied yet, and smelt terrible (cigarette smoke, while I specifically requested for a NON-SMOKING ROOM, they just replied, this was all they had *sigh*). Once the bell boy came up to my room to send my baggage, I complained to him the room hadn't been cleaned yet. It wasn't his initiative to ask me why the room was in such a mess!! So he called someone from another division, to immediately clean the room. But I said I needed to get online and do my business work on my notebook computer, so I told him to clean up the room in an hour's time. They did eventually clean the room after an hour.I had a quick conversation with the housekeeper staff, and he didn't have a good command of English (Singaporeans DO have good command of English). I speculate they hired illegal workers of some sort from some rouge states. At first I wanted to tell him to do some specific cleaning in the bathroom, but as he couldn't understand what I was saying, I told myself What the heck.. I got some other work to do. So I left him alone.My colleagues had problems checking in too.. The receptionist requested that I, as the principal booker of the rooms to physically be with them as they were trying to check in. (my colleagues checked in way later after me, because they had to be going somewhere that day..). She refused to tell them what my room number was, thus giving them a hard time.. But they eventually let them check in, after a series of angry remarks thrown to the receptionist. After I heard about the incident, I called the front desk if MY COLLEAGUES' names were on the check-in list for that day, and true enough, they were on the list. So why the heck did she go all that trouble to hinder them from checking in? Till this day, I'm still confused..My colleagues' rooms' air-conditioning was not fully operative in a sense that it's not emitting cold air. It was quite warm indeed.. We specifically asked for rooms with fully-functional air-conditioning units that blew real cold air ! (Singapore is real hot)Three days later, in the morning, broadband internet connection was down, for 6 hours. Hell, I couldn't have any work done. I complained to the duty manager on the phone, that I was really pissed. He replied calmly saying the whole hotel had an internet connection trouble even with the businesspeople who were attending some important meeting in the conference rooms. I told him I was so disappointed I wouldn't stay in this hotel anymore, but he pestered me to give them another chance. Broadband internet wasn't that fast too.. (and they charged very dearly for that.. like S$ 20 / hour of usage, and up to $40 / day).. Download speeds are maxed out at 25 Kb/s compared to the previous hotel I stayed at, Royal Plaza on Scotts, which had speeds of up to 240+ Kb/s (and it's also free there...).I sat at the lobby lounge, surfing away on the web when suddenly cigarette smoke smell began to irritate me, and I kindly requested the waiter to escort me to a non-smoking area. She said, there's no NON-SMOKING area in the hotel.. The day I was about to check out, the lady in the cashier asked me to wait a little while.. as they were doing some checkout procedures which took over ten minutes. So I asked her what was the problem? Why did it take so long? She eventually admitted to having problems with the system/network. They can't login to the system.. What an absolute mess!!! I needed to rush to the airport, as I was just in the nick of time to catch my flight back to my home city..If location isn't a factor, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, but I do highly recommend Royal Plaza on Scotts. It's a great hotel for almost the same price (cheaper that is) as Marina Mandarin.

<Content>Great hotel!! This is a great hotel, close to Orchard Road and the Marina bay area... Cracking atrium when you first walk in and the service is great. The hotel itself was very clean throughout, although the rooms perhaps a bit dated. Having said that, the bathroom was great with powerful shower and lovely deep bath (if those sorts of things are important to you!) The pool area is clean and family friendly, and much needed when staying in Singapore! Great balcony overlooking the business hub, and would definitely stay again when next in Singapore.

<Content>Poor rooms and shocking service! This hotel is shocking, we arrived at the hotel at 4am, no porter staff around to help with our bags so we had to struggle up to the 4th floor where we found the reception. It felt like the hotel had switched off the air conditioning as it was very hot in the lobby. Check-in took a very long time 30+ mins and we certainly didn鈥檛 get that normal Singaporean welcome that I always receive at the Sheraton Towers. So at about 5am we struggled up to our room on the seventh floor only to find that the room was dirty and had not been serviced from a previous guest. So we walked back to the front desk only to wait another 30 mins before begin allocated another room, the reception staff were so unhelpful and didn鈥檛 even apologies for any inconvenience. So we went up to our new room to find that it was a double room with 2 single beds, instead of the king room that we had booked. (Why didn鈥檛 the staff ask if this was ok?) I called down to reception a third time only to wait another 15mins while they played around with their computers to be told that this was the only room left in the hotel. By this time it was approaching 6am so I told the manager that I was not paying $200+ for a room for 2 hours just to take a shower. All he offered me was 15%off. I told them to forget it and cancel the room and I ended up staying in a friend鈥檚 room for the few hours. If my friends were not staying here I would have departed and gone to the Raffles Plaza or Ritz, so the next morning I checked in again and was given the original room on the seventh floor that had now been cleaned, on close inspection the room was very tired and in need of renovation and a really good spring clean, dirt on the carpet, marks on the bed cover, hair in the bathroom, mold in the shower and items missing from the mini bar. I returned to the front desk again and spoke with the manager, he said he would upgrade me to a premium deluxe room with a city view but could not give this to me until 1pm, I also managed to get free breakfast out of him for 2nights. When I returned at 1pm it took the incompetent reception staff another 15mins just to give me the key to my new room on the 15th floor, the room was really no different to the original one and didn鈥檛 have a city view like promised. I spoke to the manager again and a few hours later I was moved to a city view room. I will never stay at this hotel again, putting aside there false claims of newly renovated rooms, there customer service is just so poor, to get anything out of them was such a mission and were do these hotels get off charging $25+ for the internet.

<Content>Great Stay I stayed at this Hotel in August 2006. The stay was excellent. Everything was good. Service, food, rooms, atmosphere were all excellant. But I did not stay there on a weekend. I was told that on Sundays the hang bird cages with live birds in the atrium and one can enjoy the chirping sound of the birds. If true, I will not stay at this hotel again. I DO NOT SUPPORT THAT. I BELIEVE NO ANINMAL OR BIRDS SHOULD BE CAGED.

<Content>A bit disappointed Stayed here for 2 nights on our return from a trip to Oz. Arrived very tired around 2 a.m. as our flight was delayed and was greeted by a very unfriendly receptionist (not the usual friendly Singaporean welcome!). She said they only had one room left, even though we had paid for and reserved a room weeks ago. We were told that we could be moved the next day if we wished but as we were only going to be staying for two nights we felt sure the room they had to offer us would be sufficient. How wrong we were!!! We were given a tiny room on the 6th floor right next door to a conference room and a break out area for smoking and drinking tea and coffee. The two single beds we were given were very uncomfortable and seemed to be a pull out type bed for children 鈥?not the kingsize bed we were expecting. The carpets were stained and the bathroom and room overall was in desperate need of refurbishment. By the next morning and a miserable night鈥檚 sleep (even though we were exhausted) we decided that the room was not acceptable even for just another night鈥檚 stay. Reception this time was slightly more helpful and offered us a room change to a higher floor later in the day. What a difference 7 floors make! The room was spacious with a good view and a comfortable kingsize bed 鈥?this was all we had been expecting from a hotel of this standard. The hotel itself seems a little dated but all the public areas were clean and tidy. Only ate in the hotel once for breakfast which was average. The pool and sun desk was wonderful and the staff there were extremely helpful. The hotel鈥檚 location is great but with all the construction going on in the area, it makes it quite difficult to walk above ground from a to b. Unfortunately, our first impressions of this hotel was not great but the second night did make up for it. We would not stay here again, as I think there are many more far superior hotels to choose from in Singapore.

<Content>Nice hotel Arriving at the hotel after a 19 hours direct flight from NY, I was really looking forward to a nice comfy bed for a quick nap. Despite the 11AM arrival, I was quickly checked in and was shown to my room quickly.The room is about the same size as the one that I had from the Pan Pacific that is close by. It is however a bit smaller than the one from the Grand Hyatt. The bed is a bit on the soft side but otherwisecomfortable. The view from my room is slightly better than the Pan Pacific but not by much.The marble/granite bathroom also have the same separate bathtub and shower although it is a bit smaller than Pan Pacific and also a bit more worn out. The amenities are good without being as exciting as the Grand Hyatt offerings.There are a quartet playing music in the atrium every night just like the Pan Pacific and the same bird chirping in the morning. The bird songs are quite soothing for a morning wakeup call.Outside the hotel, is a quick walk to a hawker center that opens every night around 6PM that you can get a quick snack. It takes a bit of walking if you like to reach the MRT but it is not too bad since most of the walking will be inside ti escape the Singapore heat.The Marina Mandarin is not quite a 5 stars in my book but a good solid 4.5. It is a toss between the Pan Pacific and the Marina Mandarin for me. I feels the Grand Hyatt is a bit above both of these but you can't go wrong with any of them.

<Content>Nice Hotel in a central location Stayed at the Marina Mandarin for 4 nights on our way to/from Oz. The hotel is about 20 years old, but was recently refurbished. It has a very impressive galleried Atrium design which rises up to the 21st floor level. The main reception area is on the 4th floor.The hotel is very central in Singapore and close to all the main amenities. There is a lower rooftop pool etc. on the 6th floor and restaurants (which we didn't use). Some rooms overlook the marina area and some look into the city area. I would recommend a room on a high level (10+ ?) in order to get a decent view above other nearby high buildings. Do not take a room on the 6th floor as this is used for conferences etc.  the bed's are hard  uncomfortable. All the rooms have a small outside balcony, but no chairs on them. Overall I would recommend this hotel for a short stop over in Singapore.

<Content>Good enough without being outstanding It was average for a 5 star hotel.Decent size room, big plasma television and room to work.I think the refurb money must have gone on the bathrooms and public areas.The food in the two restaurants was first class and the singer/string quartet in the atrium in the evenings were of high standard.So really nothing to moan about but nothing to particularly enthuse over either.I would go again mainly for the food , location and nice people.

<Content>Great value, good location, perfect for Suntec participants Stayed here while I was attending a convention at Suntec City. It's just across the street so was extremely convenient, not just to go to Suntec in the morning, but also to get around Singapore as it is next to a mall (well the whole city is malls after malls so maybe that should've been a given) and a subway station. The room was nice, bathroom very lovely and elegant. Service was good throughout. I booked through the website and got an excellent rate on the weekend. For the money, it was definitely fantastic value, considering it's a 5 star hotel and a couple days before I checked in here I was staying at a 3.5 star hotel for only slightly less. Must say that the breakfast here was among the best I have had in any hotel, the room that it was served in was very stylish and didn't feel crowded in anyway. The only grouse -- internet in the room was not free. Nowadays, especially in business hotels, internet should be provided free of charge. Still, don't think it's worth knocking off one star here, this hotel is deserving of the Leading Hotel of the World label it garnered.

<Content>Not as good as expected Having read that the Marina Mandarin had had a huge makeove I expected something special and it was just average. Most of the staff were very pleasant and helpful although on one evening the girls in the bar were very off hand.The rooms are average and didn't really look as though they had been refurbished in fact I would say they were drab. The bathroom was super though. The pool staff were delightful as were the staff in the Italian restaurnat and the food was excellent there too. Would I go back - Probably not. We have been to the Pan Pacific over the road on several occasions and I would deffinately say it is better.

<Content>Acceptable, but not quite to expectations I had high expectations of the Marina Mandarin, but unfortunately the overall experience fell slightly short of those expectations.The hotel is in a very convenient location right next to Marina Square and Suntec city. Our room on the 13th floor had a nice view from the balcony across the Esplanade to the high rises downtown.On arrival we were efficiently greeted at the door and our bags taken care of. On check in we were informed that no non smoking room was available with a king bed, but that a twin room was available. I was happy to accept the smoking room on the basis that we could switch to the non smoking twin if neccessary. I was also assured that the smell in the room would not be too bad and if it was to call reception to change. We were escorted to the room which stank of stale cigar smoke, and was non too clean. Ash was present all around the chair arms, and the glass table had the remains of the previous occupants room service stuck in the groove around the glass. I contacted reception to ask to be moved but, was told that there were no other rooms available, but that housekeeping would be sent to deal with the problem. Housekeeping arrived and sprayed some air freshner, but seemed unconcerned about the mess around the table and chair. The housekeeping manager arrived some minutes later, and agreed that the table needed a clean, which was quickly undertaken.The room was pleasantly decorated, spacious and featured a good sized bathroom. The hotel itself is impressive in scale, but as someone else said, the modest refurbishment budget didn't go very far in a building of this scale, the hotel certainly does not have a new feel to it. I feel that for the discounted rate that I paid that the Marina Mandarin represented good value, but had I paid the full rate I would have been dissapointed with the rough edges aound the experience.

It is a nice location with a connected shopping mall that provided easy access to a wide range of casual dining for nights when I didn't need a big expensive meal. The room was very modern: wireless internet free, plasma tv, deluxe bathroom. Staff was Singaporean -- attentive, kind, constantly available.Food in restaurants was very good. Breakfast buffet is really superb.

Staff were all helpful and polite with rooms being to a very high standard.Loved the song birds in the morning and the band in the evening which didnt really disturb once you closed your room door. Location is excellent for Marina Square shopping and SA Hop on/off bus. Would love to stay there again.

<Content>Good location My husband  I stayed at this hotel for 1 night only as we were too late arriving in Singapore to catch the ferry to Bintan. Having stayed in Singapore a couple of times before we just basically wanted a hotel with restaurants/shops nearby and out travel agent suggested this one. It certainly fit the bill. Room was spacious. Bathroom was a bit dated but all in all for 1 night it suited us. Through the hotel you could get to Marina Square shopping centre which was large with plenty of eating places. We are non smokers and I heard the receptionist tell someone that they do not have non smoking rooms but refresh each room after guests depart. I can honestly say that our room gave no indication of anyone ever having smoked in there.

<Content>Good experience Stayed at The Marina Mandarin in Nov 06 for 5 nights with great promotion from expedia and I don't have much to complain about really. While checking in, I asked for a room with a nice view and was provided with a 14th floor corner room overlooking the Marina and The Oriental was right opposite - fantastic choice. The only downside was the walk from lifts as I had to walk in a big square shape every morning and night! The room has been partly renovated and was in a suitable size and good condition. Some pieces of furniture looked tired, but wasnt a big deal. Bathroom was clean and spacious but looked kind of late 80's. I agree with every reviews below about the noise from the lobby area which sometimes the songs could put me to deep sleep and sometimes it could be a little frustrating. The location is perfect in terms of physical comfort. Restaurants and shops in Marina Square were easily reached and if you need to take a cab, there is always one - I never ever had to wait for it. The spa was amazing. The atmosphere was so serene and I just loved going there for treatments. The rates were not friendly but service was spot on - highly recommended.The two problems I came across while staying at the hotel were the conceirge and the crowd. I was a solo traveller and hardly know anyone in town so when I was asking for crucial information, this man seems to always be rushing to do something and never let me finished my sentence. I just got fed up with the service so I helped myself with the directions in the end. As for the crowd, there were wedding receptions held at the hotel twice during my stay which made it troublesome getting in and out from the main entrance.All in all, I would not mind staying at the Marina Mandarin next time I visit Singapore.

<Content>Overall, a Good but Not Great Hotel Having stayed 6 days at the hotel, I found the overall experience there as good. I would stay there again even though it would not be my first choice. Check-in was efficient although not as friendly as most of the other staff in other areas. The greeter at the lobby Aquamarine Restaurant was excellent- he was friendly and knowledgeable- he also offered wonderful advice about places to shop. The buffet at the restaurant was very good as was the Chinese restaurant on the 5th Floor.The employees who help secure cars and open doors when you arrive at the hotel were also very good and friendly. It is clear that the hotel, overall, understands how to deliver good service. Employees would almost always say hello when passing you in the halls.The biggest negative here is the loudness of the music from the 4th floor lobby bar (Check-in is actually on the 4th floor here). I was on the 16th floor and the music actually sounded like it was in the hallway outside my room. Most guests that I spoke with also complained about the loudness. While the atrium here is very nice, the design at the Marina Mandarin represents how form took precedence over function. It is just poor design to have hotel rooms that require people to use ear plugs to try to sleep. I certainly would hesitate bringing anybody here who needs a quiet environment. Internet use for every 24 hour period was high at $21 SG or about $15 U.S. A more accurate rating probably would be 3.5 stars.

<Content>Horible! Check in took 25 minutes. Absolutely no excuse, especialy given rooms were already prebooked, credit card provided, room preferences lodged etc etc. Much is made of the new 'refurbishments'. The improvements in the room were just plain tacky. To give some context, a grand total of $25 million (SG) were spent renovating an entire hotel.....not much - and it shows. Light fittings were falling out of newly plastered false walls. New tiles in the bathroom stuck on top of the old ones were already coming off, room internet did not work and the TV flickered constantly between black and white with big lines through the centre. 5 star hotel? Puhlease! This hotel is miles behind most other 5 star hotels in SIngapore. To top it off - despite being a '5 star' you have to PAY to use the most basic of facilities like a spa and a steam room. When you combine all this together with the fact that it is a 20 minute walk from the MRT, you would be crazy to ever stay in a hotel like this when you are so spoiled for choice in Singapore.

<Content>"Party Hotel" -- Not for family with young kids or babies! We stayed there for 4 nights with 2 babies.On 2nd night, loud noise/singing from our closed window /balcony(facing the poolside restaurant) **past midnight**. Apparently FB had a wedding banquet there and no one from the hotel management 'cared for' the noise. We called and they did stop the loud singing.On our 4th night, which is New Year's eve there a is countdown. We were okay with the noise since this is once-a-year event. However, they charged $70+SG for the lounge (in the middle of the hotel) and they sang until 2am. I complained but in vain -- the hotel manager said the 'official bar/party time' in SG is until 3am. It was v. v. loud that night, ***until about 2 am***. If you like partying, you may enjoy the free music (though I am not so sure about 'Phantom of the Opera' in the middle of the night.). But if you have young kids/babies or if you do need sleep, then this is not the place for you.This is a place where FB and the accomodations have no communications or care for the hotel guests. It seems 'lounge' music/singing is a big thing for them. Due to the 'structure' of the hotel, I assure you when they have a party there, you can hear the music all night.

<Content>Fabulous Service and well equipped rooms This is a good looking hotel with generous public spaces and superb friendly service. The rooms on the Executive Floor Levels (top two floors) were great with free internet access, (limited)complimentary laundry service and large rooms. The bathroom was equipped with crabtree  Evelyn products and replenished each day. My only (minor) gripe was that breakfast in the main restaurant was a bit of a 'bun-fight', so I guess I should have tried out the Exec. Lounge. With easy access to nearby shopping malls this is a good location too - although you'd be hard pressed to be far from anywhere in Singapore.

<Content>Stunning hotel but don't accept a room on the 6th floor We stayed on a Singapore Airlines overnighter and arrived late after a 10 hour flight from New Zealand. Check-in appeared very helpful and efficient but they must have known they were giving us a substandard room. The sixth floor is largely taken up with function rooms and the bedrooms on that floor have beds which fold way into the wall so that they can be easily converted into function rooms. These beds are extemely hard and uncomfortable and the rooms are noisy. When we asked to be moved, the reception staff did not seem to have the authority and it took an hour and two further phone calls to effect a move to a 10th floor room. This was very comfortable and reasonably quiet.We paid an additional 100 S$ for a 6pm checkout which I thought was reasonable, breakfast was good and we had an excellent dinner in the hotel's Italian Restaurant. The Hotel has a stunning design and, if we had been given the 10 floor room first, we would consider it excellent

<Content>Good hotel It seems that each time before staying at the Marina Mandarin, the most recent Tripadvisor review has a stern warning, DO NOT GO THERE, and after reading the review, I keep lowering my expectations. How likely will my stay be as bad as the most recent guest? I am lucky to report that it is nowhere as bad. This was my 2nd stay at the Marina Mandarin in 3 months, and it was overall as good as my 1st stay. I arrived at the hotel at 1 am again and a doorman was there to open the taxi door and deliver my bag to room 1228. Last time, there was no one there to greet me. Room 1228 was nonsmoking as requested but instead of a king bed, I was given 2 small beds. I had trouble sleeping in it, but I considered that the room was generally fine, so I didn't ask to change. It had a huge balcony overlooking the street and the pool at the Pan Pacific. The balcony was so huge you could have a barbecue. Unlike last time when the safe was out of order, this time, it was workable although I did have a problem on my 3rd and last night. There was some kind of power malfunction and I couldn't open the safe. It was 10:30 pm and I called housekeeping and they sent someone within 10 minutes, took care of it and apologized for the inconvenience. Service at the Marina Mandarin overall was excellent, whenever I called, they greeted me by name and were ready to help. I would suggest that on checkout, it would help if the front desk smiled more, it seemed like it was hard for them to smile as if they can't stand their jobs. The fitness center, while small, was open 24 hours, which was great. Breakfast was disappointing again, but not for the price. I got there at 6:30 to find that they were not serving eggs. They were serving ham and bacon but no eggs. How can you serve a breakfast buffet without eggs? There were other minor annoyances but nothing that would discourage me from staying at the Marina Mandarin again.

<Content>Woderful Mandarin My partner and I stayed in this hotel during the last week of October 2006.To begin with we very tired having arrived in Singapore after a late flight from Beijing.The Reception Staff were very courteous and helpful.Our room was large and very comfortable.On our first morning my partner was quite ill as we had had a late banquet in Beijing the night before and he must have eaten something bad. However, the roomservice Captain , Raj, was extremely helpful as were the reception staff and the Housekeeping personnel. The Hotel Doctor came almost immediately and everything was soon back to normal. Breakfast, the next morning was very good. For dinner, The Leonardo da Vinci Restaurant was extremely good and we, thoroughly enjoyed the cocktail lounger with the singer, Michelle and her pianist and the string quartet. We heartily recommend this Hotel and will definitely stay again when we pass through Singapore.

<Content>wonderfully exceeded expectations .....having watched all the other passengers being dropped off at their hotels I was pleasantly surprised when I came to the Marina. It looked magnificent even though it was in the process of being renovated.Checking in was speedy and my room and the service were impeccable.The lounge was amazingly welcoming and yet very flash with its beautiful decor and fabulous singapore sling!The accompanying piano and on the next night the quartet, were lovely.Breakfast enabled me to try true singaporean food one morning and regular english the next. I should have stuck to more authentic food though as the 'usual' was same as....All in all the hotel was delightful and the food was too.Unfortunately the renovations made it difficult to access the road by foot, though the subway , I found was the best way to walk anyway due to the heat.The check out was a little disconcerting as I was made to feel a little like a criminal because I dealt with my bill the night before to save time in the morning and had to wait for the staff to verify this for almost 10 minutes!I was dissapointed with the local stalls as they were few and far between. I later found out that it was because I was there on a Sunday and public holiday! However All the shops were open! I wish I had been able to find that out before hand somehow....

<Content>Average hotel Stayed there during one of the weekend taking up the offer of weekend break with breakfast. The rooms has been renovated but the toilet wall and floor isn't. The 80s marble was the giveaway. Location wise is good if you want to goto the Esplanade for performances or visit the Suntec exhibition. Else it is some distance to walk to the MRT station. The hotel is attached to the Marina shopping complex which lacks vibrancy as it may be a bit on the higher end. Parked our car there as the hotel shares the parking with the patrons of the complex. We received a vulgar note from the car owner on the left because we park our car within our box but 5 inches away from the edge of our box. This is because of a huge lorry parking on the right of us. One thing to note is the complementary car parking ticket. It is issued once a day and it is valid for one time use only. So plan your trip if you want free parking. Breakfast is average. The spread is sufficient but not overwhelming, as you may expect of a 4 star hotel. The ham, sausages and bacon appears to be of the cheaper quality. They could do better at this.Its true, as mentioned by all the writer here, the singing at the lounge do get to the room. So get a high floor. The staff is courteous, efficient and friendly. I would not stay there again unless I am visitng the Esplande or Suntec exhibition as there are better location to stay.

<Content>Fantastic service We arrived at the Marina Mandarin after a dreadful start to our trip at the Rasa Sentosa. The difference between the two properties could not have been wider. The welcome at the Marina was superb; we were ushered to the club lounge and offered champagne to eradicate the previous experience. A terrifically appointed club room with huge wide-screen TV and a proper massage shower. All very modern yet informal too. Excellent breakfast and cocktails served by an attentive and welcoming staff.Highly recommended.

<Content>Great room and breakfast at the Marina Mandarin We had a lovely stay in a newly refurbished room at the Marina Mandarin with a view over the bay. The business package was great with access to snacks and the Business Lounge at anytime. Breakfast and cocktails in the Club Lounge was very nice but I must admit that the breakfast downstairs has a huge variety of foods. The hotel is newly refurbished. The bathroom was lovely and quite modern. The swimming pool area also was very nice. The hotel adjoins a nice shopping centre, its close to all amenities and the Millenia Walk.Mrs M.G.

<Content>impressive We stayed here for two nights on the way back from Australia. We have two young teenage boys so had ajoining double rooms.First impressions were very good. We were met outside the hotel as we got out of the taxi. Before I even spoke, a member of staff greeted me by name. I don't really know how she did this, maybe she had been there for hours greeting every visitor with our name till she got it right!.The luggage was taken away and she took us up to reception, checked us in, then took us up to the rooms, showed us how everything worked, and left saying your luggage wont be long. Literally seconds after she left the room, she knocked on the door and said, you luggage is here.The rooms were very spacious with a view of the pool, which was nice. On close inspection however, they weren't very well cleaned. There was dust behind the taps on the bidet and the toilet had pee stains at the back of the seat. I think if these items aren't cleaned well, then what else has been skipped?The bedding was spotless though, as were the towels.The shower had good pressure and there was a good range of toiletries. The bathrooms were quite big.There was a sharp tack sticking up near the bathroom door, it seemed to be from the carpet gripper thing between the rooms. We pointed it out the cleaner the next day and it was dealt with.The singer in the Atrium on the 4th floor, who we could hear from our room, (only faintly with the door closed) was very good. We went to the bar to listen, and ordered the obligatory singapore sling. It wasn't cheap, but came with a big bowl of nuts and things.We had breakfast on our last day. there is a staggering array of food, including noodles and chicken. Eggs are cooked to order. The coffee was very strong.it is a fair walk to the MRT, but is worth it, it is cheap, efficient and very clean. A trip to local stations cost about 50p each. China town and little India are well worth a visit, they are not as sterilized as Singapore generally. There are lots of places to eat, especially if you like asian food. The prices vary a lot though. We ate in the banana leaf restaurant in little india, reasonable and authentic, you eat off a banana leaf with your hand (RIGHT HAND). although they do bring a fork and spoon for westerners.Sentosa the leisure island just across a bridge, (or take the cable car if you are ok with hights) is well worth a day's visit. Lots to see and do. Good for kids.I would stay at the Marina Mandarin again, despite the slightly inadequate hygiene, take a chance on another room having a better cleaner. We did wish that we had had more time in singapore, but after a 3 week holiday, we were also glad to be going home.

<Content>Worn and impersonal Just stayed three nights at the Marina Mandarin. Room was small, tired and worn with the bathroom in need of a good mould removing treatment. Breakfast was OK, although the coffee and tea were quite horrible, and only just lukewarm. Overall feel is of a tired hotel caught in a 1970's/80's time warp. I will not be returning.

<Content>Great hotel Our arrival in Singapore (a stop off for 3 nights on our return home from Bali) got off to a bad start. Our travel company had forgotton to book our transport from the airport to the hotel, although we had paid a total sum of 拢92 for a return journey (they did return this) so we had to get a taxi which was less than 拢5 each way (quite a difference!). Just before we left Bali I had a problem with a tooth. On arrival at this hotel we explained about the mix up with the transport (although this had absolutely nothing to do with the hotel) and that I needed to see a dentist. They immediately sorted everything out for us, also making a dental appoointment for me. We were shown to our room immediately, with a very helpful staff member. The room was brilliant with a fantastic view of the area, including Raffles Hotel and the River. The bathroom was amazing. We had no problems whatever with this hotel and was very satisfied with the service and room. The breakfast was excellent, with a exceptionally large choice for all nationalities. The consierge arranged for us to go on a harbour river dinner cruise, which was an excellent evening and also included a pick up and drop off service. We arrived on the eve of the Singapore Independence Day and the area was heaving with people for a day or so and the hotel was very busy but the service was never compromised. The service and politeness of the staff were excellent. The hotel is in a brilliant position. You dont even have to go outside to enter a massive, spotlessly clean, shopping centre, and the Suntec Centre is right across the road. Raffles is just a short walk and its shopping centre. The walk along the river to Clarke Quay and Boat Quay is a loverly walk, especially on an evening. We had a brilliant steak meal (the best ever my husband said) at a restaurant on Clarke Quay called something like the 1 and only. Totally recommended.We would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Nice enough - perhaps there's better out there??? I was recommended this hotel by the travel agent for location and standard. It certainly has a pretty lobby and a lot of facilities, and to start our holiday I was quite impressed (unfortunately for the Marina, we went on to stay in the Equatorial, KL and the Dusit Thani, Bangkok which were far superior!!)Like another reviewer we also had to wait over an hour for our room (to be fair, we did arrive in Singapore rather early - 10am). The room itself had a sea view and a little balcony - all nice enough, but lacking a certain something...The fitness centre and pool were, however, superb and the breakfast was excellent - wide choice and very very tasty!Location-wise - it's convenient particularly for Raffles and the shopping areas, even Orchard Road is walkable...but to be fair a lot Singapore is walkable - if you can take the heat. It's adjacent to the Marina Square Mall and just across the road from the Esplanade for any avid theatre fans. Overall, it's a nice hotel, and without comparrisson I'd have said it was above average, but knowing what's out there, perhaps it's just OK.

<Content>Serious Security Breach After a wonderful holiday in Singapore and Bali my mum and I spent our final night in the Marina Mandarin before flying home. What a mistake!We arrived in the afternoon to be given the usual spiel about upgrading (shown glossy pictures and so on). We politely declined and asked for our room key. But no, the room was not ready yet. But why didn't we eat lunch in the restaurant and come back in 45 minutes?At the restaurant we discovered that despite the claim of 'All Day Dining' lunch had actually finished. We could have room service but of course we had no room...Back at the front desk we were then told that the room wasn't ready, they did not know when it would be ready. We could have a smoking room (which we declined) or a room without a bath (which we declined). Could they put us in one of the rooms they had offered us as an upgrade? No, the hotel was now 'completely full'. After asking for a supervisor (much rolled eyes from the receptionist) they managed to find us a nonsmoking room with a bath. We walked in and found that the aircon was on full blast. it was overcast outside and quite cold so we tried to turn the aircon off. No luck. The reception didnt answer the phone. Down I went and was promised someone would be up to fix it. They didnt come. 45 minutes later I tried again. Eventually after another 30 minutes more a man arrived, who didnt speak English, and started tinkering with the air vent. He went away again. Still cold air blasting. Down to reception again to be advised, if you are really that cold, just open your patio doors. There was a very noisy building site outside.They promised to fix it and we went out shopping. Came back that evening and the room was absolutely freezing. Down to reception again where I insisted we be moved to a room that was a normal temperature. Pack up your luggage and someone will be with you, we were told. We sat for 45 minutes. Nobody came. Apparently there were not enough porters to help us! The poor reception girl (who was tiny) appeared and helped us lug our luggage up a few floors to our new room. Hooray, the heating was now at a normal temperature. I wont go into too many details about the appaling sound proofing of the rooms (the lounge singer sounded as if she was in our bathroom), we were so exhausted we just collapsed. My friend left on an early flight but I was fast asleep at 9 o'clock when my room door opened and in walked two strangers. There was obvious confusion and they disappeared. Down at the duty manager's desk he apologised for the mix up, but I was furious. How could a hotel give guests the key to a room where someone was asleep? He offered me late check out and free lunch but I was still furious.There are so many great hotels in SIngapore - avoid this one!

Nothing special, and to be honest - I don't understand why they are member of Leading hotels of the world.

<Content>Some aspects great My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights with our 8 y.o. on our way over to the UK. We can not usually afford 5 star hotels so this was a bit of a treat for us. We loved the interior of this hotel ie the atrium complete with piano playing and singing rising up to our floor in the evening and the beautiful singing birds in the daytime. Found the staff helpful and polite most of the time except when one or two were unable to understand English. Also had to ask four or five times for someone to come up to our room and put the extra bed for our son into the room. Not very good service considering they knew we were coming well in advance! Also had problems with water not draining well in the shower, but overall found the room satisfactory. Rooms with view of the harbour much nicer than other side. Ate the buffet breakfast one morning and the buffet dinner one evening. The food was fantastic and service in the restaurants very good. Variety and quality of food was superb. Didn't intend to do this, expected to eat out in the city more often but as our son wanted to sit in the room and watch cable TV we took the option of letting him do this while we sat in the restaurant and enjoyed a meal, went up to check on him every 1/2 hour. Location I would agree is not ideal as only really convenient for shopping mall and Raffles, not the other sights of Singapore. Also not sure how this happened but got talked into some bus tours to the Zoo and Night Safari at a time when we were extemely jetlagged and fuzzy-headed enough to make the wrong decision to book these. This eventuated after a phone call by a tour operator shortly after we arrived in our room. Basically if you book one of these tours you will pay a high price for a bus out to the zoo, which takes forever as it stops at several other hotels where you have to wait for other tourists to get onto the bus - at one point they even merged us onto two different buses. Then we were disappointed to find no actual tour once we got to the Zoo, simply the guide who had travelled on the bus with us told us to all meet back at the entrance at a particular time. As a result of all the waiting time on the way there and once inside the zoo when she tried to gather everybody together simply to tell us to meet back at the entrance we did not have enough time to see all the wonderful animals and had paid way more than the zoo entrance fee and the cost of a public bus or taxi out there. Quite the rip-off!Overall, had a great stay at this hotel, and absolutely loved Singapore. The pool was a welcome refreshment in view of the humidity of this city but didn't have much time to use it or the gym!

<Content>Comfortable and friendly Having read through previous reviews on the Marina Mandarin, and every other comparably priced hotel in Singapore, I decided to stay here. The result was wonderful. The hotel lobby and atrium are beautiful, and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. They are not, however, furnished with the most modern and updated looks and amenities. For someone who travels on business 60% of the year, I consider this an affordable and comfortable hotel, where customers are treated with exceptional service. The location is great, being adjacent to a mall, and right next to the Esplanade.

<Content>Great atrium, rooms okay The hotel's atrium is very lovely, the restaurants are decent. I liked the breakfast buffet very much. I thought the staff was always very friendly, and they did a good job at remembering me. The concierges did a great job arranging a couple touristy things for my friends and I at our request.My complaints are about the location, and the room itself: The nearest MRT station is a 15 minute walk through an underground mall. There's not much really walkable nearby except for said mall and the Raffles, so you do a lot of taxi'ing...bot a big deal really cause the cabs are cheap if you don't end up in a limo cab, a bmw charging you $25 for being a bmw, just sillyThe room was nothing spectacular. I was on the 15th floor, and I will say I had a very nice view, there's a very slender balcony, and if you go on that you have an even better view. But the room was dull and on the small side. Also, I had problems with my shower, the water just would not drain. I had a puddle almost to my ankle after just a couple minutes, so I'd have to stop and wait 5-10 minutes for it to drain before continuing to wash off.Also, the gym was very nice - above average. I liked the pool a lot as well. You can use your room card to get in after hours, which was nice. I enjoyed a couple 4am swims while I was getting used to the time change.

<Content>Guest Services Excelled! At the last minute I decide to fly to the Great Singapore Sales and selected this property..I forwarded an email a few days before requesting the Venus room(For ladies ..has fresh flowers extra toiletries hair rollers etc) as I was staying by myself. On arrival we looked at this room with Marina view only to hear a generator loudly with the door shut. I had read the rooms ending in 01/02where the rooms to get. You see the Hotel is built likewith rooms facing opp to water so it is shaped in a beehive so balconys(which need to be re-tiled and made bigger) wrap around the views. So we went over the other side to 1602 and this was a premier room that was done up and superb.The lady said it was no more because I had booked the venus room.It faced the city/harbor/look left to the water to see the Merlion and you could see the pool with the sound of a huge waterfall to stop the traffic noise and amazing sunsets!!It had the new wood grain look, plasma,all done in gold and beiges with leather bedhead and amazing artwork modern floral arrangements the bathroom had that new mint green smoked glass with ultimate marble bathroom, huge shower head and Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, bath and m/up Mirror......The lighting was so amazing with controls for reading/relax/movie/sleep..I had time to play with all the gadgets..leather compediums for notepad and directories..every night turn down with crisp white mat and slippers awaiting as you slide into the crisp white sheets in a K/Sbed with 4 x pillows and a soft white feather doona..after an ice bucket is delivered every night..you drifted off to the sound of the piano softly in the lobby and awoke to two newsapers and the sound of birds in the amazing atrium with the huge bronze sequined earing hanging down(the fake plants could be not as prolific maybe more orchids as around the pool....the pool was pretty minimmal I swam every morning awaiting for shops to open as not to 11 or walked the esplanade and went to the Marina Suare s/c for Blackrice porridge(S$1.50) and a cup of superb tea made in big Steel pot(S50c) It was my aniversary while I was there and I mentioned it to Guest sevices.....next thing I know up comes 4 x Strawberries dipped in chocolate white and dark with a card signed by the staff I knew and a ffew others..how sweet!The guest staff where always so informative and helpful wrie down to where I could get Perankan cuisine.I reccommend this as a traveller by yourself but I am sure the family would enjoy it as well but then i wouldnt have got much shopping done would I!On checking out the account had a S$50 extra each night for the Venus room...now I wasnt told this!They explained I was sent an email re extra charge which arrived after I had left Austrailia so after much discussion they credited the extra charge which I was very grateful for..Recommend this for location better than Orchard Rd as near three major Shopping areas..Raffles..Marina square and Suntec city. Idid have to go and buy another suitcase at the Hypermarket The Giant but what a bargin..2 x for S$29..I will be back!

<Content>Did I just get lucky? I was surprised to read these other reviews, I recently stayed at the Marina Mandarin, just for one day, but was treated like a queen and thought for the price a great experience. I think I had a deluxe room and it was grand. I even had pineapple cakes specially made for the hotel waiting for me. I also had a thank you letter waiting for me from the hotel when I arrived back in the states. VERY service oriented and I am a stickler for service. The only down side is that the conceirge said the bus tour was the best thing to do and that was a bad choice.... you don't need to see Little India, China town or the obligatory sales shop for diamonds at the diamond outlet.... that stop really ticked me off for we were there forever. The thing to see is the National Orchid garden at the Botanical Garden, spectacular. Take a water taxi (easily rented up and down the water ways) to see a tour of the water and take the Hippo bus instead.... hop on and hop off. Cheaper than the organized tour and a lot more fun. I would highly recommend the hotel... centrally located, great service, lots of business amenities.... the look of the lobby is a bit 80's, but hey, who spends time in the lobby?

<Content>Still wanting after the refurbishment I stayed at this hotel three times, twice before the refurbishment, and once after the renovations. The works are the usual update to the common areas such as lobby, restaurants etc. Some of the premium rooms were also refurbished totally (I did not see them) but not the deluxe rooms. Some small fixtures such as shower heads and TV were changed, but the room looked very much the same. Some of the writers who lamented about the room's tired look are right -- you seem to have returned to 1980s Whitney Houston 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody' days. It was one of the host hotels of Miss Universe 1987 and that was really the capsule what the rooms have been trapped in...As for service, the previous two times were so-so and the treatment we got was lousy, to say the least. They were not obliging and unpampering, and some of the staff were actually curt or downright rude.For the May 2006 stay, it was slightly better, but still very much the Singaporean materr-of-fact way. Greetings, smiles etc were there, but there was nothing to rave about.The promotional rates this hotel give for weekend stays are quite good. But given what you pay, it's very much a tad below expectations. And since it touts itself as a member of the Leading Hotels of the World, I think they better do something to the amenities of the rooms, the look/design of the rooms and also the service standard. Otherwise, there won't be too many repeat customers unless your rates are competitive, and frankly, price is NOT everything...

<Content>Lux hotel but service lacking The Marina Mandarin has recently undergone an extensive renovation, so on our return to Singapore, we booked in for a 4 night stay. The room was excellent - modern  clean, with nice touches like robes, newspaper, CE bathroom products, etc. The rest of the hotel was also excellent - nice bar, good food. Now the issue - service is really poor. First, we received an email confirming a 6pm check out and 15% off all Food  Beverages in the hotel (this was a special offer that we secured on the website). On checking in, we were told our check out was 2pm, and despite insisting they were wrong, they point blank refused to budge unless I dug out a copy of the mail confirm. Then on leaving and checking out, we did receive 15% off restaurant bills, but not off the bar bill - they claimed this was not included under the Food  Beverage special offer, which is frankly a joke. Finally, no courtesy room or shower facilities, which given most western flights leave Changi late in the evening, was very poor. Overall I'd stay there again, but its time to sort out the service if the Marina Mandarin wants to stay competitive against a host of great Singapore hotels.

<Content>It is not a 5 star hotel I used to stay at the Marina Mandarin on Rafles every time I was in Singapore. This time, I have decided to stay at the Oriental (which is far more better than Marina Mandarin) but for the last night of stay, I could not get a room and must book at the Marina Mandarin. The Marina Mandarin has just gone through a big renovation. It is very nice in the hall, the entrance but they have forgotten to do something about the ROOMS. I have booked a Deluxe Harbour View Room and I got a small smelly with the view of the Oriental Hotel. I have called the front desk to ask about it and they confirm that it is the Harbour View if you lean outside the balcony and look to the right. When asking for another room, they say that it is all booked up. My room is old and smelly and lack of a lot of things for a 5 * hotel. I guess that after staying at a real 5 * such as Oriental, you can compare. No fruit plates, no newspaper in the morning. Now for the service, that is another thing. No smiley faces at the reception. When arrived at the hotel, I have received a letter from Mr. David Lim wishing me a nice stay as a returned customer (what a joke). Left him the message for the complaint about the room. Nothing. No return call.This is the last time that I will be staying at this hotel. You could find much better service and much better rooms for the same price at others hotels. Don't get fool by the outside look. Ask to check for your room beforehand.

<Content>Fabulous A conventiently located luxury hotel which has a nice outdoor pool and gym facilities. The buffet breakfast in the morning is also outstanding.On the downside there isn't a sauna/jacuzzi, which could be expected from a five star hotel. Overall a great hotel and I would definitely return to the Marina Mandarin.

<Content>Will return to the Marina We were very impressed with this hotel when the staff made an excellent start on our early morning arrival from Delhi by finding a room ready for us to move into immediately. We expected to be told it won't be available until 10.00 am or worse 1.00 pm. Although the room was due for refurbishment, it was fresh and clean. The hotel is convenient to the MTR which can be reached by walking underground from the hotel. There happened to be a first class trio playing in the cocktail area at night - music to suit most guests. It was a pleasure to stay-in rather than seek entertainment outside the hotel. The buffet breakfasts were first class.

<Content>A wonderful place to stay We stayed here for just one night, but we wished it could have been for longer. It is an amazing hotel, with a beautiful interior. The room was very comfortable with a huge bathroom and all the luxuries you'd expect. The swimming pool was lovely and has lots of sun loungers around it. But our favourite part was the atrium which is just a pleasure to relax in. The location is great, with a handy underground walkway through designer shopping centres to reach raffles. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel, and we will definitely stay there again if we get to return to Singapore.

<Content>Excellent Buffets The location is fairly central-close proximity to 3 very large shopping malls and across the road to the hop on bus which takes you to Orchard Rd. The rooms were spacious (compared to HK) and well maintained. The highlight of the hotel is their food. As part of our SIA stopover package, we were given 50% discount on inhouse menus. The buffet either b'fast,lunch or dinner is to die for. Drinks were expensive but this is across Singapore in general. Try also the No sign seafood and Quayside Seafood for the chilli crabs and baby fried octupus.

<Content>Loved it Stayed there on a stop-over for two nights early February 2006.Room was spacious, as was the bathroom. All the amneties you would expect in the bathroom, twowel robe, slippers etc. (although a bit small for european feet). Minibar and room service were extremely cheap by comparison to European hotels.Do not try the internet on the inroom TV, though, it flickers and you can hardly read a thing.Staff was very friendly and helped with arranging tour, luggage storage and delivery.Only downside was the noise from the street (my room faced Suntec City) and that, due to MRT construction work, the hotel is currently a bit hard to access on foot (cross a six lane street or take a detour through the neighbouring, mazelike shopping mall to get to Suntec City, MRT and busses).The SIA hop on-hop off leaves just across the street, though, if that is an option for you.

<Content>Enjoyable stay We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The buffet breakfast was fantastic and a real highlight. The location of the hotel is very good but it can be confusing finding your way in and out. The atrium is impressive and clearly inspired by Star Wars... The fitness centre and swimming pool areas are both well maintained and staffed. The only small faults: there was no balcony furniture and only one comfortable chair in a double room, the broadband internet access in the room is overpriced and really nowadays could be complimentary. The bathroom was fantastic, with his  hers basins and separate shower and bath. When we stayed (over Chinese New Year) there were more tourists than business travelers, but we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Delightful Hotel Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Marina Mandarin in Singapore on our way back from Australia, already planning our next trip and it will definately include another stay at the Marina Mandarin. The staff were super eficient,most polite and helpful. The reception and bar areas were most impressive with birds singing in the morning and a string quartet playing in the evening. Comfortable seats with lots of trickling water made it a very pleasant place to sit and have an evening drink. Breakfast was scrumptious with lots of choice. Bedroom was average but the whole experience of staying at this hotel was delightful.

<Content>Simply gorgeous We stayed the the hotel from 31 Dec to 3 Jan and loved it! Our requests for connecting rooms and harbour views were met.... and surpassed. We wanted the harbour view primarily for the New Year Day's fireworks and we got the best view available, I reckon. The room was SGD198++ and was definitely worth every cent, for the view we had. Spectacular. The rooms were spacious and 'high tech'. Large LCD widescreen TV too. The pool was great, especially with 24 hour access. There is nothing better than soaking in the pool after late night shopping! Although it's not close the the MRT, we found that the shops are Suntec City and the newly refurbished Marina Square Mall were adequate. The only horror was when my partner and I craved a coffee at 11pm one night. Went down to the lobby cafe (where they had a live band) to have our cuppas and was slightly thrown at the prices charged. We had an Irish coffee each and a hot chocolate, which ended up bring just over SGD50. Phew! That was scary. The staff were very helpful and also prompt. I feel that it's much better than the Mandarin Orchard in every aspect.

<Content>Rarified luxury and elegance We stayed as a family of four in connecting rooms-great value as it was practically two rooms, one with only shower but luxurious and the other full bathroom. Check in from Ground Floor with personal greeter who took us to Reception on Level 4. Great service with a smile and all obviously picked for their good looks! Lovely Eastern atmosphere with Mod cons. The hotel has had major refurbishment but because of its age rooms are big. Excellent service with rapid check-ups to make sure things had been done. Free drinking water great touch. We did not have the breakfast package but at less than one tenth the cost had great local coffee (Jim Fook at S$1!)-there is also big American chain across at SunTec. Also two or three high-quality food courts at Marina Square and SunTec next door. There is no longer any direct connection from hotel to shopping centres which is good as it provides security and privacy, although one way key card access would be an idea on a rainy day as it is easy to get lost in the huge complexes.Two downsides-the balcony needs the doors sound-proofed as we were there on the weekend and the outdoor music concerts were very noisy. The door to the corridor also needs a seal as the live music from the lobby areas echoes upwards although more quietly. (the corridors can be better lit as well). A great bonus was the live birds in the public areas which sing beautifully in the morning. There were sharma birds and nightingales (thankfully looking healthy in their bamboo cages!).

<Content>Nice hotel with all facilities, but.. My wife and I stayed at the Marina Mandarin for 6 nights at the end of November for a trade show. This was my fourth time in Singapore and selected the Marina Mandarin this time because it had just finished a major re-furbishment and was effectively a new hotel located across from the SunTec centre. The hotel is fine and the lobby very impressive indeed. However. we both independently said the same thing, the hotel is very nice but, for some reason it just did not click with us. The room was good but not outstanding, it had a balcony but no furniture on it, at breakfast they struggled to keep everything stocked and kept running our of basics like bread and fruit. The gym was very good, but the pool area which had just been finished, was a major dissapointment. The re-furbishment cost a lot of money, but apart from the lobby I am not certain they got good value. Of course we do not know what it was like before. Last time I stayed in the Pan Pacfic, and on balance would choose that again over the Marina. On the plus side, the location is good for the waterfront, and when they have completed the subway building, there will be a station right outside.

<Content>Marina Mandarin renovated - improved public areas Stayed at the Marina Mandarin only for one night since I couldn't get a flight back home. Last time I stayed was right before the renovation, when the public areas and FB outlets indeed were a bit shabby.Now the public areas are a lot more up-to-date, albeit in a boring minimalistic way. Seems like there was minimal renovation in the guest rooms -- the bathroom, I think, is exactly the same except for new lighting and sink taps (which now don't match the shower and bath taps at all!).The pool area and gym are quite pleasant, accessible with your room key thus open 24 hours. Too bad it was raining or otherwise I would've had a midnite swim in the well-lit pool.All-in-all, quite a good place to stay. Definitely nicer than the Meritus Mandarin on Orchard. Except that, as are all hotels in the Marina area, are quite secluded at night. Among these hotels though, I'd still choose the Conrad or Pan Pacific, which are closer and more accessible to the Millenia or Suntec Towers than the Marina Mandarin/Ritz Carlton/Oriental.
