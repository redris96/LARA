<Content>Away from the traffic New Otani is not going to be a 5-Star Experience or anything like that but it is a good value for being on the Beach and this close to the Zoo, Aquarium, Diamond Head and Waikiki. If looking for a good vaule, this migh be your place

<Content>Beautiful wedding stay and reception at the New Otani Kaimana My husband and I stayed at the New Otani along with 13 guests for our wedding trip at the beginning of December. My parents and I had stayed at the New Otani during a previous visit to Oahu, so we were familiar with the location and hotel. We knew it would be the perfect place for our guests to stay as well as for our reception.From the beginning, we told our guests that the rooms would be small. When my parents and I stayed at the New Otani a few years ago, we had an oceanview room with a cot crammed into it. It was not a pleasant experience. This time around, we informed all of our guests that the rooms would be small but that it was an oceanfront boutique hotel at an affordable price. We had a variety of rooms at all price levels--the majority of our guests were in Moderate rooms, but a few had Oceanview or Diamond Head view rooms. My husband and I had an Ocean Front (317) room, and my parents were upgraded to an Ocean Front Junior Suite (718) room. All of the rooms were impeccably kept. The chilled pineapple in the fridge upon arrival was the perfect touch.I agree with previous posts regarding palm trees obscuring views. If you want a view, request a room on a high floor. We had a wrap-around balcony that had a great view of the ocean as well as a very good view of Waikiki. It was partially obscured by the palm trees, but I'm scared of heights and refused to have a higher room. Our view was wonderful, but if you're adamant that you want the perfect view, request to be higher up.All of our guests loved the rooms and the access to the beach. The service at the front desk was wonderful; the staff was also willing to help us out and offer us some aloha spirit. I am forever in gratitude for their kindness.Quite a few of our guests ate many meals in the Hau Tree Lanai and enjoyed it immensely. I had one breakfast there, and it was perfect. We also loved the little snack counter in the annex that has spam musubi and chicken rice balls. My husband and I ate way too many of these! I wish I had had time to try the organic shave ice syrups--they sound way too good. It is a fair walk into Waikiki, which is either good or bad, depending on your perspective. We walked through the park at night and never felt concerned over our safety. You're at least a 10-minute walk from the closest ABC Store, which in Waikiki is a rarity. However, the New Otani has its own little snack counter and shop where you can purchase food.We worked extensively with Lisa to plan our reception, and it went off without a hitch. Our wedding was in Waimanalo and coordinated separately, but Lisa and the Hau Tree did an incredible job. The florist had dropped off a beautiful centerpiece, and the Hau Tree set it out for us. Our musician, Doug Fitch, was recommended by Lisa and performed slack-key guitar music perfect for the occasion. My mother had ordered appetizer trays in advance, and they came out quickly once our guests arrived. The Hau Tree was also very accommodating with special requests. I wanted a pasta dish but don't eat shrimp, so the Hau Tree prepared me a special chicken-mushroom pasta instead. It was very, very special. They did a fantastic job in handling our reception, and we will always recommend them to anyone.My only unhappy experience at the New Otani wasn't actually related to the New Otani itself. A few hours after our reception at the Hau Tree had finished, my father-in-law and his girlfriend decided to have a commitment ceremony with a minister on the 2nd-floor balcony directly below our room--specifically after we had asked them not to do so. The result of this was that they made the rest of our time at the New Otani very uncomfortable and awkward for the rest of our guests and ourselves. Luckily the staff of the New Otani was very kind to my husband and me through this incident, and we hope to stay there again in the future under very different circumstances.

<Content>Great with a couple exceptions Overall, the Hotel was very nice. There were just a couple minor irritations. The biggest problem was the lack of a proper bathroom door. The door was akin to a door-sized window shutter that slid shut. It was just a bit uncomfortable to have little to no privacy while using bathroom. The room was quite small, which made the lack of a proper bathroom door much more irritating. Our room had a built in desk, mirror, closet and TV stand on one wall and the rest of the room was completely taken up by the queen-sized bed, with very little room to move around. If while traveling, you prefer a spacious room, this may not be for you, though they did manage to squeeze a very large flat screen TV in the room. That aside, everything else was great. The restaurant was top-notch and the outdoor seating area gave you the feeling that you were eating on the beach, which was nice. The lobby was also very well decorated. Also, the view from our room was great as we had a great view of the ocean and the park next door. The staff were very polite, but we really didn't interact with them too much so can't really give an opinion on them either way. As for the location, it is on the beach and is approx. half of one mile away from the area where most shops and hotels are located. The tours that we attended while in Hawaii didn't pick up from our hotel (not to say that others wouldn't) but asked that we walk down to the main street to meet at a larger hotel, which wasn't necessarily bad since we had nice weather, but depending on the weather, it could be a major inconvenience if you鈥檙e being picked up by tour companies. I would say that this was an average to above-average accommodation and is a good value for what you receive.

<Content>Great hotel away from the crowd We have stayed at the hotel several times. It is with quiet nice, courteous staff, and clean rooms.The restaurant on the ground level facing the beach is a bit overpriced, especially for dinner ; the service staff can be a bit surly . There is a sushi restaurant at the hotel which we have never tried. There are some amazing ( and not touristy ) restaurants a short cab ride away on Kapahulu Ave. that offer a variety of reasonable ethnic cuisine.The rooms can be a bit small but suggest ocean view only since the other rooms face high rises and this defeats the purpose of being in a tropical setting.

Everything was great at the hotel and the room was perfect,sea view and looking towards Waikiki beach. The beach outside of the hotel was great and the little coffee shop as you come out of the hotel did the best coffee and fresh sandwiches. We met some wonderfull people and the staff were very helpful . Thanks to everyone who made our dream come true Patricia and Geoff Payne.Norwich England

<Content>Excellent Quiet Location We chose this hotel due to the reviews here on trip advisor. Excellent location away from the hustle and busle of downtown wakai. Excellent beach outside the hotel with good snorkelling. Shop close by for snacks etc. Would recomend paying that little extra for a room with a view as we had the view of the next hotel (but hey you don't come to Hawaii to sit in the room). An awesome time.

<Content>Unbelieveable Setting We moved to the New Otani after starting at another hotel (Aqua Bamboo) that just didn't live up to our expectations.I was on my morning walk on the second day of our trip when I happened across the New Otani. It was a little ways from where we were staying, but it is in a very quiet end of Waikiki essentially in a park, on the beach. I went in and inquired about rates and I was very surprised that they were not much more than the place we were in three blocks from the beach.I walked back to my hotel, got my wife and walked back to have breakfast at the New Otani. She loved the place instantly, so while she was having breakfast I went to the men's room. I really went to the front desk and asked if they had any rooms open for the next four days. They did, I actually had a couple of choices and I chose an Ocean View Deluxe room for little more than I was was paying to not really see the ocean.I didn't tell my wife anything until after we got back to the other hotel after lunch. I started packing my bags. When she asked what I was doing, I told I had had it with where we were! She thought I was nuts.... well I can't carry off jokes very well so I told her I had booked at the New Otani. Her bag flew out of the closet as SHE packed to get over to the New Otani.Our room wasn't ready so the bellman held onto our bags, but we were able to change into our bathing suits and go enjoy the beach outside the side door of the hotel.What a delightthis hotel is! The dining room is literally on the beach!Our room was spacious enough, but not huge. But oh the view off our lani!! It looks down all of Waikiki Beach. We enjoyed watching the sunset from our room one night over a nice bottle of champagne.The one negative is I suppose that there is no pool, but since you are on top of a pristine beach with 80 degree water, that didn't really matter.I can't say enough good things about our experience here.

<Content>Not bad I got a great deal, but it wasn't my money. I traveled for business and stayed two days at this hotel. There are many positives. Yes it is quiet but close to the action, a boutique hotel, staff was great w/ bartender Gerry a legend with repeat patrons over many many years, many other things close by, and very pretty views. I can't imagine ever staying here with the wife and kid in such a small room. The AC, although very good was right next to my bed. It blew down on me the first night until I was freezing. I managed to adjust the motorized air vent control, but I didn't totally get it figured out. The bathroom I thought was a bit dated and water didn't run down the bathtub/shower drain the best. The beach is small here.I hope the info helps, I people watched a lot of happy tourists and locals in Honolulu, that helped make this business trip a bit easier.

<Content>Beautiful Location The New Otani is near Diamond Head, and well removed from the hectic Waikiki Beach area. It is a bit isolated from other restaurants and shops, but it is right on a beautiful beach with great views of the ocean and Diamond Head. It has a great beachfront restaurant and lounge. The room was small but very clean and comfortable, good bedding with duvet cover. It was a nice romantic spot, and we were sorry we could only spend one night there on our way back to the mainland.

<Content>Quiet but close to all that Waikiki offers My wife  I, both late 50's, stayed at the New Otani for 7 nights in early March. This hotel is located on the Diamond Head end of Waikiki, which is less busy then the area around the Royal Hawaiian. The hotel has no pool but the beach is very nice  Kapiolani park is next door. Breakfasts  lunches are great, figure $15 per plate  dinner in the bar worked for us. We did not eat dinner in the restaurant. Staff very helpful. If you need lawn chairs for the beach just ask the front desk. At night we felt very safe walking to  from the main part of Waikiki. We prefer the Big Island, but if we go back to Waikiki will definately stay at the New Otani.

<Content>Nice quiet location We stayed three nights at the New Otani Kaimana Beach. The hotel is next to a park where there is a zoo and an aquarium. We were able to walk to those places and also to the Diamond Head crater and trail head. The walk to the trail head is a little longer, approx. 2 miles. The hotel has a nice beach in front, a great Japanese restaurant, a nice beach front restaurant and a lounge. There is a small store on-site also. The walk into Waikiki is aprox. a mile so you can shop, eat, and join the crowds there but then return to a nice quiet relaxing hotel.

<Content>The best location in Waikiki My husband grew up in Honolulu, so when we were choosing a hotel for our Christmas holiday, we knew we wanted to be on the beach, but not in the centre of Waikiki. The New Otani Kaimana Beach is perfectly situated on a quiet street at the 'end' of Waikiki surrounded by a perfect, quiet beach and the beautiful Kapiolani Park.We stayed in an Ocean Front Room which is a corner room which has a wrap-around balcony facing Waikiki. It was wonderful to sleep with the balcony doors open and the sound of the waves lulling us to sleep. I would highly recommend paying the extra money to upgrade to one of these rooms.The hotel is owned and run by the Japan-based New Otani Hotel Group, which virtually ensures impeccable and polite service.The hotel itself, including the rooms, are a bit dated, however, you really will not find another hotel in Waikiki with this proximity to the ocean, unobstructed views and balconies for a better price!

<Content>Looking for peace in all the right places When I booked my room for my first trip to Honolulu I was looking for a place where I could relax as well as be close to waikiki. I hit the cover off the ball on this one. I was put in the annex, number 309, which is the closest to the beach on the top floor. The porch(lanai) opens onto a beautiful park with a good view of the ocean. I asked to see some of the the other rooms in the main building and was cheerfully given the grand tour. All the rooms were clean and would have a hard time choosing between an ocean view(in the sun), or the spetacular view of Diamondhead(in the shade). I stayed with the annex room mostly because it had a microwave and sink(hotplates on request) where the rooms in the main building did not. I had a breakfast,poi pancakes with three different types of sausage and a side of potatoes obrian, almost more than I could eat and everything exceptional. I had one dinner there, mahi mahi over a bed of creamed linguini. The filet was huge, enough for a snack for the next day. The service here is top notch not only in the restaurant but front desk, easily the most beautiful women on the island, bell staff eager and respectful, maid service efficent and thorough. There is no need to rent a car as bus service goes everywhere, including the airport, for 2$ with one free transfer per day. The number 2 bus stops almost in front of the hotel right in view of a beautiful fountain. If you are 55 you can get a seniors discount if you call the hotel on their toll free number. The aquarium is just a chip shot away and the zoo just beyond that. The snorkeling was good in front of the hotel but better on the other side of the aquarium. I walk alot by choice and was never bothered by anyone between the hotel and the waikiki strip. Truely paradise found. Aloaha

<Content>Good Hotel Choice My lady and I just spent 5 days at this hotel. We generally like places with a bit more local flavor.... not the typical fancy resort type place. The New Otani was excellent. It is small and right on the beach, the rooms can be quite small, so spring for the Deluxe rooms that are larger as it is definitely worth the extra money. The staff was excellent. We had a small problem with the tub drain and there was a guy fixing it within about 10 minutes. The restaurant is excellent for any meal, but breakfasts just have something special about them. Many locals come to the hotel just to eat breakfast. In general, you get the feeling that you are staying in a fine hotel a couple of decades ago, before Waikiki became the totally commercial and over-developed place it is now. If you want comfort, serenity, good service and good food all at a reasonable price, along with a fine location directly on a good stretch of beach.... then the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel is an excellent choice.

The best rooms are on the suites on the top floors. get one of those if you can. The food in the hotel is OK, but you can do better out in town. The beach however is quite and clean and that is what most people want most. The price for the room is good compared to the rest of the beach front resorts on that strip.

One of the older hotels but surrounded by beach on one side and the park on the other, only a short 10 minute walk to waikiki with all the ABC shops and restaurants.We had a suite overlooking the park and the beach to Waikiki with beautiful views, very glad we stayed there and not in Waikiki as it is full on tourists with people everywhere.This hotel also has it's own private beach so is not crowded.

<Content>Quiet location - OK value Nice room #312 - we were on 3rd floor, with a view of the Waikiki high rises and beach only slightly obscured by palm trees.Didn't try the restaurants - there's a Japanese and a Hawaiian - appeared a little expensive.OK value - I think we were paying about $230 / night which I thought was good for Waikiki, but when we needed an extra night on Thanksgiving night, they coudn't accommodate, but found us a top floor, ocean view room in the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani right on Waikiki for $185 - odd.Location is nice - the beach is wide there (better than the main drag I'd say), and attracts fewer visitors. Its a 10 minute walk to the middle of Waikiki.

<Content>Good Value Near Waikiki This is a very good bargain for hotels in Honolulu. It is right on the beach -- amazing view from ocean front rooms! It is very convenient to Waikiki, but not right in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. The hotel is located in the midst of an attractive city park right next to Diamond Head, and is about a 10 minute walk from Waikiki proper.My husband and I spent two nights here at the end of September 2007 and were extremely pleased with our choice. If we ever return to Honolulu, I know this is where we will stay. We had an ocean front junior suite, and while it was not large it was very comfortable. It had a nice balcony, plenty of closet space, and a separate shower and tub. It was nice to have separate living and bedroom areas (they are separated by sliding doors). The patio restaurant is right on the beach and the setting is gorgeous -- the food is OK. For a longer stay it would get old to have most meals there, but there are many other choices nearby.I think it would be hard to beat the location and amenities for the price -- we paid less than $300 for our room (you get a discount by booking directly through the hotel's site).

<Content>For $135/night, it's the best value on the island. My wife and I were looking to do an inexpensive week in Hawaii so that we can come back more often. The New Otani is probably the least expensive hotel that is directly on the beach -which means that you can walk out of the lobby onto sand -and it has great snorkeling. My wife and I were surprised to find a sea turtle in such a busy area as Waikiki. The hotel location was a short walk from the maddening crowds and though the surrounding parks had some homeless wandering around (like in Santa Monica, CA) we didn鈥檛 feel unsafe or uncomfortable. By the way, if you are a runner like me I could not think of a better place to stay to maintain you daily runs. Instead of playing the 'ocean view games鈥?we just decided to go for the least expensive room available. Internet rate of $135/night. Our room actually had a partial view of the ocean and Diamond Head. Perhaps it was a slow week and we got upgraded. The room was very small, a bit dated, but clean. My only gripe is that there is no door to the bathroom 鈥搊nly a sliding type louvered door. You better be very familiar with your traveling partner or you soon will be. The hotel is not fancy by any means but it was not a disappointment. It is just a reasonable clean place. We didn鈥檛 try any of the restaurants but did go to the fantastic Diamond Head grill at the W Hotel just 100 feet away. If you plan on spending your time outside of your room and need a good, clean, and inexpensive home base then I think the New Otani is a good choice.

<Content>Perfect When confirming our reservation I mentioned that we would be on our honeymoon. After checking in, we were informed that we've been upgraded! We received a beautiful suite on the top floor, ocean front. What a start! A nice living area, HUGE bathroom, large and comfortable bed, panoramic view! Of course we spent a little more money in the restaurant. The food and service, from the valet to the busboy was very pleasant. We only stayed 3 nights, wish it were more. The beach was semi-private, yet you felt like you were alone. The Mai-Tais were the best on our entire trip, sunset included! Whenever we go back to Hawaii, will definitly stay here. You're away from the noise of Waikiki, very relaxing. Moral of the story....Perfect!

<Content>Wonderful location on the beach Great small little hotel just east of Waikiki. (5 minute walk) The location and the Hau Tree restaurant are wonderful. The rooms are small, but who spends time in their room in Hawaii. If you do not like to walk or need a pool this hotel is not for you. Breakfast at the Hau Tree is a must. The best seat in town. I would recommend this hotel to older couples without children who do not need all the glits and glamore of a large resort. We had a moderate room with a great view of Diamond Head and a narrow stretch of the beach. I will stay here again with my wife, but not with my children.Request a room on a high floor for a bette view and breeze.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed on the fifth floor, which had magnificent views of Waikiki, the beach and park. The room was a little small, but certainly big enough for two.The staff were all lovely and very helpful, when asked questions.We had a fifteen minute walk into Waikiki, which was good exercise. There are buses at the end and across the park and the 8, 19 and 20 take you to the Ala Moana shopping centre, where all the main shops are. The No. 2 bus is the only one that actually goes past the hotel, coming back, but if you take one of the others, there's just a short walk across the park to the hotel.We especially enjoyed the quiet surroundings of the hotel and the beach attached to it was lovely. Swimming was great.

<Content>Peace and quiet in Waikiki.. Booked 2 rooms - one for me and the other for my teenage daughter and her 2 girlfriends. I had the ocean view room. The room itself was a bit small, considering the divider had a single bed in the living room. The bedroom itself had 2 single beds, so 3 people fit comfortably in one room. The view itself was very gorgeous. and mesmerizing. I took a nap one afternoon with the screen door open and fell asleep listening to the ocean. My daughter and her friend's were put into the older 3 story walk-up building. It was very spacious and you could easily fit 5 people. They had a microwave, dishes, a dining table with 4 chairs, large outside balcony, coffee maker and 4 large closets, a vanity station, and small shower. For the value, I suggest getting the 1 bedroom. I liked the fact that your hotel card key is used for each floor of the walk-up building, insuring better security. The location is perfect for a Waikiki Shell concert. Food wise, you should venture downstairs to have coffee and great baked goods (muffins, sinful desserts, etc). The restaurant downstairs has a great Sunday breakfast (hint: make reservations) and the food was a bit pricey, but worth it. My daughter ordered breakfast through room service and it arrived within 10 minutes. I have yet to experience any hotel beat this record time. The location being farther away from the noisy part of Waikiki is great because you are forced to walk at least 1/4 - 1/2 mile to the better restaurants. The food areas closer to the hotel are the local Starbuck's and Lulu's. Not to mention Teddy's Burgers. For parking, arrive early and park on the street (free parking) as there are many stalls near the hotel. The Sans Souci beach is much cleaner than the more populated part of Waikiki and is drop dead gorgeous. The hotel provides a small safe and internet service has to be ordered for a fee. Not having to wait for the elevator is a plus because you do not wait long for one to arrive! This is one of the older hotels in Waikiki and is a popular place for those who prefer to be near Waikiki away from the loud noisy streets. Call them today!

<Content>Wonderfully relaxing My wife and I have been staying in this hotel regularly since 1990. We find it wonderfully relaxing particularly if you are staying in a room at least on the seventh floor facing the ocean. The swaying coconut palms that are just below you are amazingly hypnotic. This is the only hotel that I know that I can spend hours on the balcony with a book ; totally at ease.The rooms are a little small but with the beach immediately adjacent and the park also adjacent it is easy to go for a peaceful stroll so if like me you quickly go ' stir crazy ' it will not happen here.There is a small store just at the front of the hotel to buy sandwiches and beer and wine so it is entirely possible to have an al-fresco picnic in the park, or on the beach, or on your balcony. If you take alcohol onto the beach be careful as in June within seven days we saw three Police patrols looking for drugs/alcohol ? I personally find that reassuring - just be careful.The staff are friendly and helpful and many have been there for years ! The restaurant overlooking the beach and at its level is lovely.

<Content>Perfect Price - Perfect Location We spent 4 nights here the second week of June. I was very pleasantly surprised. The check in was smooth and the staff very polite and helpful. The hotel is very clean and although the room was small, we did have an ocean view. When I say small, I mean not much bigger than a cruise ship room and vey little storage. Since we were going to be at that hotel such a short time I wasnt going to complain, my husband however was not pleased. It really was a tight fit.The bed from the mattresses all the way to the pillows was a statement in comfort. I did not mind being in a hotel bed one minute I was there and I have never said that about a bed other than my own in my life. Believe me what the room lacks in space is made up for just by a good nights sleep.The room had a little fidge, but no coffee maker. I always travel with a small one of my own so I wasnt put out by it. It was nice drinking coffee on the balcony reading the paper that was included with our room pkg. every morning. Boy, those surfers sure get up early to ride the waves! The Otani also has a beach front location and a very nice beach. I've heard some say they snorkeled with good results, we however had no luck and we only did it once, so who knows.The hotel has a couple of different resturants, We ate breakfast there one morning and it was good, but a little pricey, I thought. There is also a snack bar that has beach access that was pretty good also, offering sandwiched, hot dogs, chile, soup, muffins and drinks. I also used the laundry mat on site, which did the job quite well. There is also a small convinience store which is great for snacks or souveniers on site as well. I think its open til 10PM or so.This hotel is close to the towns activity yet set apart by a park so it never feels crowded around the hotel area. Very relaxing to walk to breakfast through the park and watch the ocean! Lu Lu's is just up the street and offers great food at a reasonable price.All in all this is a great place to stay and I would stay there again with no problem. It's clean and very accommidating. It's not a 5 star, but your not paying 5 star rates either. If ya can't handle this hotel, you probably should'nt travel much because there's a lot worse out there!

<Content>Be Picky about the room they give you! We reserved a deluxe ocean view room which was approximately $260 per night. Our view from the 3rd floor was of a lot of palm trees, the park and if you leaned out, of the ocean. Ask and wait if needed for a 5th floor or higher room. It's not worth the price on the third floor. Still it's better than staying at most hotels in Waikiki. The walking distance to a the beach can't be beat and being across the street from a spacious park is also a plus. The room for the price came with very few amenities, a very small refrigerator, an old hair dryer, and that's about it. I would also recommend that you look into staying at the Iikai Hotel on the opposite side of Waikiki. It's expensive, but it has fantastic views, it's quiet as well, very spacious rooms, and you get so much more value for your money.

<Content>A Gem in Waikiki I love the Kaimana Beach Hotel. I first discovered it when the old Halekulani was torn down to make room for the new Halekulani. It was the perfect transition between the old Hawaiiana of the Halekulani and the modern resort the Halekulani became. The Kaimana is one of the most delighful hotels in Waikiki and a relative bargin too.I actually think the Kaimana has a better location than the Halekulani. It sits on San Souci beach near the Outrigger Canoe Club and on Kapiolani Park. It is much quieter than the heart of Waikiki, yet walking distance of it all.When the Halekulani is booked, this is one of my main back-ups, the Moana being my other top choice.Even when I DO get into the Halekulani I still come down to the Kaimana for at least one meal, and sometimes more, at the Hau Tree Lanai. It is one of the most pleasant eating spots in all of Hawaii.Be forwarned, the regular rooms are TINY, but the rates are so reasonable you can get a junior suite for the cost of a deluxe room at most other properties.

<Content>Great location! We stayed at the Otani only for one night to break up our trip from Sydney to Las Vegas. The room was adequate for the amount of time we spent in it - i.e we didn't arrive till about 1am  booked out about 10am so really only needed somewhere to sleep. The room was a bit on the small side so don't think you would want to stay in a standard room for any longer than a day or two.However the location was great. It was out of town at Diamond Head but right on the beach. This allowed us to go for a walk by the sea and adjoining park when we woke late  then sit in the restaurant which was right on the beach for breakfast  enjoy the view. After another short walk it was time to pack up, check out  head back to the airport for our flight on to Las Veagas.We would certainly do this again. It allowed us to go through immigration in Honolulu rather than Los Angeles or San Francisco which was much easier  quicker. And it was nice to go for a walk by the beach in the sun when we woke.

<Content>Quiet Time at the Beach I booked this hotel after reading a few travel books, based on the fact that it was smaller, away from the bustle of Waikiki, and somewhat near the University at Monoa. I knew not to take the NimitzHighway exit to get there, as it is on the far east end of Kapiolani Park, and is a bit hard to find. The staff was very friendly. My daughter and I were upgraded to a clean, small room with twin beds, with a fabulous view of both San Souci beach, and Kapiolani Park and Waikiki in the distance. We ate breakfast every day outdoors at the nice restaurant on site. Waikiki is a fifteen minute walk away, or the bus ($2.00) stops right down the street at the aquarium. Parking (valet) was a cinch, and the lot is so small it doesn't take more than a few minutes to get your car. The park got noisy on the weekendnights, but it wasn't unpleasant. The small beach gets crowded duringthe day, but is quiet at night. I would recommend this hotel to people who want a quieter place to stay away from Waikiki, and who don't mind either walking, or driving around Oahu.

<Content>Okay Hotel The hotel rooms are much too small. There was only about two feet of space when you walked into the room. There was no room to put suitcases. We cleared off the space above the TV for my husbands and put mine on the floor under the TV. I don't think I'd ever stayed in a room so small.The A/C either makes the room too hot or too cold. We were constantly making adjustments (even in the middle of the night). The air also seemed to blow directly down. We couldn't find a way to adjust it.We found the bar prices to be a bit high. We had a Mai Tai at Duke's for $7, and they were $9 at the hotel bar, and it was made with lesser quality ingredients (in my opinion). The restaurant prices seemed high, so we never ate there, so I can't give a review on that.The beach was almost a private beach for the hotel. It was quiet and peaceful. (Compared to Waikiki) The hotel lent us mats and towels to use. This was very nice.The bellman is also the valet, towel lender, direction-giver, luggage checker, etc. They need another person to assist with this job. We had to wait frequently, because we couldn't find the bellman, because he was outside somewhere or giving directions.Also, we had a later flight, so we asked if we could leave the bags while we walked around a bit, since checkout was at noon. They said it was fine. They had a room to put them in. We waited for the bellman, and he gave us a tag for our luggage. When we returned, we found our luggage still stacked in the lobby next to the desk. We were able to just take our luggage and walk out. No one ever questioned if it was our luggage or verified we had the tag for it. Not very secure.The walk to Waikiki was about 15 minutes. Not bad, but if I had to do it again, I would stay closer to the main beach for activities and a larger room and walk down to the beach by this hotel. Also, the buses no longer run on the road by the hotel, so you need to walk over to the zoo to catch the bus (not a bad walk 5-10 minutes), but not as convenient as described in another review).

<Content>Great Location A very quiet hotel that sits right on the beach. It is an older property that could use some updating, but it was very clean, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. If your budget allows, spend the extra few dollars for an oceanview room. You can leave your patio door open at night and let the waves lull you to sleep.

<Content>Wouldn't stay there again Booked this hotel based on frommer's guide. We were extremely disappointed. The room was not great and did not like the location. Is next to a nice park during the day , however, at night it is full of homeless and addicted people. Very scary to walk thru at night . Most activities and restaurants are towards that area. The restaurant at the hotel was over priced and not that great.

<Content>Should be demolished We stayed in an oceanfron jr. suite. The view was beautiful...the room was vile. The sink was outside the bathroom, in a corner of the bedroom. The bathroom door was not solid...it was a louver door...the shower was army camp quality...the wallpaper was peeling and the tile grout looked filthy.The hotel location is private and it is nice to be away from, but within walking distance of, Waikiki. There is no pool and no place to just sit around and read a book. There is no hotel presence on the beach. If you want a chair, rent it from the concierge and carry it to the beach! This is not luxury by my terms.The restaurant is nicely situated, but they take reservations for Breakfast tables with a good view.....so you can arrive and see an empty table with a nice view and then be seated at the table next to the dirty dishes.We walked by some rooms and saw that they were literally 3 feet wider than the bed...........Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else! As for the reviewer who never stayed at a better hotel, my deepest sympathy!

All private, fenced in parking, ponds, herb garden, tons of flowers, even flowers on the bed, so sweet, cookies, baskets of breakfst goodies brought to you in the morning, sample bath products to try and they give a percentage to the Alzheimer's foundation...they have rafts, chairs towels, lotions, the whole nine yards. You totally felt like a home away from home. The rate was under $180.00 a night I believe and that was with cleaning...but you might want to check that out and be sure to make a reservation. Very relaxing, great location, walking distance to everything including downtowm...amazing find, and NOT a studio. Kaimana's Beach Hale....Hey don't forget your picture with Kaimana...he's a hoot...no pun intended.....

<Content>Quiet retreat in Honolulu We spent five nights at the New Otani in Honolulu and were very pleased with the facilities and service. The location is a 10 minute walk from the rest of Waikiki, through a beautiful park along the coast. The hotel has its own private beach.Our room was small but comfortable with a mini refrigerator, robes, all toiletries, plenty of towels, a seating area and a balcony. The hotel website is very clear about the locations and views and prices of the rooms. We paid a little more for Diamond Head view and enjoyed that; the ocean view rooms are more. You can look at their site and pick exactly what you want. The room was clean and well maintained.The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful at all times. The concierge helped us with sightseeing.The hotel itself has an excellent Japanese restaurant, and a pleasant restaurant right on the beach, with regional cuisine and fresh ingrediants. We had several breakfasts, several lunches and a dinner there and were pleased with the food, the service and the view. There are also restaurants in a couple of nearby hotels if you don't feel like going into Waikiki.This is a great hotel for anyone who wants to experience the beauty of Honolulu without the crowds and noise.

<Content>Hawaii never again !!! About us: we have been to many countries: CUBA, MEXICO, GREECE, NETHERLANDS, ETC..For our honeymoon, we decided to travel 4700 miles to Hawaii. Our first week at Maui was great. But it didn't last. We spent the second week in Honalulu at the The New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel.Let me tell you, I am a pretty patient person that understands mistakes. I didn't care much for the Expired gift basket we received or the constant sorry no more beach towels at the front desk. But when we received a message that the valet dented our rental car, we expected them (valet service and hotel) to take care of the situation. Instead, I had to hunt down the Valet and Valet company and continuously tell them I want this taken care of. And for the Management of the hotel, Well they couldn't be bothered with this. It was MY PROBLEM So I spend 4 days trying to fix MY PROBLEM calling Thrifty, the valet company and asking the front desk why they won't help us? To add to this, I had to pay the hotel for the calls made to THRIFTY AND THE VALET SERVICE and the parking fee (116$). THAT WAS JULY, IT TOOK NUMEROUS LONG DISTANCE CALLS TO HAWAII TO FINALLY GET REIMBURSED NOVEMBERFOR THE DAMAGE (650$)TO MY VEHICLE IN NOVEMBER!! MONTHS LATER !!! and the HOTEL, after many many long distance calls and emails, still won't bother saying the word SORRY In fact they won't call me!!!! No more America vacations for me, we will visit CUBA next vacation. We have been there already and the COMMUNISTS know how to treat travellers well !!! What a bad Hotel !

<Content>Great Choice for Independents and Families with Small Children My wife, our two-year-old, and I stayed at the Kaimana Beach in Mid November in the 7th Floor Diamond Head Jr. Suite. We had a very positive experience and would stay there again without hesitation:-The room was clean, comfortable the separate bedroom was useful for putting our son down to bed early in relative quiet. -Parents keep in mind, however, that this particular room's restroom is directly accessed from the bedroom, so one cannot use the restroom until after your youngster has gone to sleep and will not wake up with the creaking of the opening door.-180-degree wrap-around patio balcony provided a truly stunning view of Diamond Head that will not soon be forgotten.-Situated at San Souci Beach, outdoor excursions with young kids is wonderfully hassle-free. The natural reef about 50 yards from the shore makes this an ideal place for small kids to have fun with the water.-The Hau Tree Restaurant was a bit pricey for lunch and dinner on our budget, but breakfast was excellent and reasonable every day, service was great, and dining under the large Hau Tree was unforgettable looking out on the beach.-Being a very short walk away from the Aquarium and Kapiolani Park was very convenient. We didn't use it, but the handy local bus system had a stop in front of the hotel.-If you stay here, go to the hotel website and look both at the different rooms and the different on-line specials. We saved much money with the free car package not only because the rental fee was waived, but the package also gives you free valet parking at the hotel - saving us another $50.The Downsides of the hotel are limited but worth mentioning:-The hotel seems to be at that precarious place of not yet, but soon, requiring renovation. The room was spacious, but the interior was getting quite dated.-Plumbing was a little bit problematic.-Rooms facing Diamond Head get a day-long blast of Hawaiian sun and our room's air conditioning system, supplemented by having to keep the floor-to-ceiling window blinds closed during the day, still didn't keep the room cool.-Although the convenience to the beach, aquarium and park were a blessing, Waikiki itself is a very long walk or an expensive parking proposition if you don't plan to/aren't able to use the bus.-For those of us who found the restaurants to be outside of budget except for breakfast, the distance of other restaurants, etc. was somewhat inconvenient, particularly with a toddler.All in all, we'd very happily stay again with our youngster because no where else will one find a comparably nice, quiet, and convenient hotel for parents of small kids right on the beach with stunning views of either the ocean or in our case, Diamond Head.

<Content>a piece of paradise, kinda My wife and I stayed 7 days here, it was mostly a good experience. Tthis hotel is a good place to sleep, eat and has a great little beach ! what more can you ask for? well maybe an upgrade on the furniture and amenities would help, looking a bit tired, staff is excellent, a/c in room kept us very comfortable lobby not air conditioned, it opens out to the beach!!! food was well prepared and served correctly, no loud noise at night , there is a park along the side and off the front excellent for walking and jogging. parking is $15.00 per day or you can hassle finding spot on street. We didn't mind being away from the insanity of the strip and we enjoyed walking off our dinner every night. The rooms can give you views of beach in back or diamond head on the western side, the park is on the eastern side and the park  diamond head on the front. they offer a laundry room and there is a little shop that sells and rents everything you need, try the coffee shop for a great cup of coffee and a fresh muffin, the best bargain in town. To qoute Arnold,  I will be back

<Content>Perfect Get-a-way My husband surprised me with a trip for our 10 year wedding anniversary and we stayed at this great little hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were smaller than average which was a little disappointing, but we figured we weren't going to be spending much time in the room. We had a beach located right in front of the hotel which wasn't nearly as packed with people as the beach in town. This was perfect to start your day or end your day with. We were close to the park and walking into town was a breeze. Downtown Waikiki is so busy it reminded me of Vegas with all the foot traffic, so it was nice to be located a greater distance than everyone else. If you are staying there and are purchasing tours that will pick you up, just an FYI, you need to go out on the sidewalk and wait in front of the hotel, because of the limited parking, the buses cannot get in/out of their lot. We did a couple of shows that required pick-up/drop-off and a guest told us where we needed to be, so we aren't left behind. I thought it was a great place to be and if I go back, I want to stay there, away from all the hustle and bustle and have access to the beach from my hotel. :) Aloha!

<Content>Get Away from Waikiki and the Malls For a much more pleasant Honolulu experience than staying at Waikiki, which is a crowded strip of hotels, shopping malls and stores (with a busy beach thrown in), try staying outside of Waikiki at the Hotel New Otani Kaimana Beach. The hotel is near Diamond Head (east of Waikiki, near the Aquarium) and is only a 20-minute walk from the center of Waikiki, but feels a world away from Waikiki. There is a small but very nice beach just next to the hotel. For travellers who like to run, this is the place to stay--good running (although on roads) around the neighboring residential areas, Diamond Head, and the park next door. The hotel itself is a decent 3-star place: lobby and rooms are on the plain side and could use re-decorating, but are clean and pleasant enough for those on a moderate to moderate-expensive budget ($100-200). Don't expect too much of the rooms, though--they are quite small and furnished with furniture that looks like it dates back to the 1970's. (See photos). But rooms are clean, if not immaculate. This is typical of Honolulu hotels at all price ranges--they are overpriced for what you get. You are paying for the location. If you can afford it, pay for a room with a beach or partial beach view. (See photo).Only major problem with rooms is that air-conditioning units, which were manually controlled, were noisy and too powerful--room became too cold--and could not be fine-tuned. So room was either too cold or too warm (but breeze from outside helped during mornings and evenings).The main restaurant with the lanai dining room is beautiful--overlooks the beach and is shaded by a large banyan tree--so be sure to have at least a drink there. But food is very mediocre.All in all, highly recommended for those who want a quiet tropical experience, not malls and big luxury hotels.

<Content>Perfect place to wind down! We stayed at the New Otani from 9/06-9/12/06. We loved it! We had booked a partial ocean view, but we were up graded to an Oceanfront since we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. It was just wonderful to sleep with our balcony window open and hear the waves as we awakened each morning. The room was clean, but nothing fancy. The hotel is in a quiet part of town but only about a 10-15 minute walk to Waikiki beach. Although the beach in front of the hotel is nice, we really felt the beaches on the Windward coast are the most beautiful. The staff was very attentive, and service at the restaurant was very good too. The Hau Tree Restaurant in the hotel is right on the beach. It was the perfect place to relax for dinner after the long trip from Virginia. The avocado crab stuffed fresh Mahii was fabulous! We ate breakfast there every morning. I loved the Sweetbread Macadamia French toast.We will most definitely return to The New Otani!

<Content>Very pleasant Hawaii getaway A brief 4 night Labor Day weekend stay on Oahu with the New Otani as our HQ turned out to be a fine choice. Upon check-in, we were told that our moderate room was not available (we booked a package on Orbitz  were not expecting anything special for the $$$) so the clerk checked us in to the Diamond Head wing. We had a partial view of the ocean  Waikiki from our terrace  had a good sized room with a kitchenette. We were on the third level so that did mean climbing stairs (wing has no elevator) but that was OK with us. The room is a bit dated... bathroom, furnishings, the general overall look of the wing looked like it could use a little upgrade from the queer eye guys but it was clean, the A/C was strong,  we could hear the surf on to the beach with our terrace door open! We used room service a couple of times after venturing around the island  thought it to be a decent deal. Especially, a seafood-sashimi/smoked fish appetizer called the tsunami which for $16 could have fed two couples. We rented a car  used valet through our stay so budget an extra $15/day for that. In closing, I liked being a little bit away from the strip of Waikiki. In my opinion, the hotel offers respectable service, with a lovely location, a little dated in its look, but a comfortable place to stay in paradise.

<Content>Great Hotel away from busy Waikiki We loved this Hotel. It was clean, quiet and what a view. If you want to get away from the busy loud Waikiki, this is the Hotel. No waiting for the elevator, only twice in seven days we had someone else in the elevator with us. We had the Ocean Front Delux Room. I would highly recommend this room as it has a huge lanai, ocean view and if you walk around the lanai you get the cool winds and view of Diamond Head. Good size room.Take a look at the The New Otani Kaimana Beach website to give you a better idea about the Hotel.Since May 2006 the Hotel is a NO Smoking Hotel. After having always stayed in Waikiki, this was wonderful, quiet and refreshing. At night in Waikiki all we heard were people party and cars, busses all night long. It was always noisy in Waikiki. What made us decide on this Hotel is that our daughter last year said that Waikiki was too noisy, she kept closing the sliding door. Our daughter loved this Hotel all the way. The room was big enough so that she had space to play and run around and for us to do things too. It was not one of those tiny rooms. The kois at the entrance were another plus. It was also great having a removable showerhead so we could rinse our daughters sand off.The only bad thing was that the Beach in front of the Hotel was more of a swimmers beach and the more shallow area had too much broken glass. We like the shallow water of the Ponds right next to Waikiki Beach . So we had to drive to Waikiki for our daughter to swim almost every day, that was not soo much fun. Here are the good things:1. Quiet, no party no noises of cars. Only ocean waves all night long.2. Clean Hotel, good service.3. No waiting for elevator.4. Free or very cheap parking along park. 5. Kapiolani Park right across the street.6. Ocean front Hotel.7. Good swimming Beach right in front of Hotel.8. Bathtub with removable showerhead. 9. Hotel has only 7 or 8 floors.10. No smoking Hotel.Here are the not so good things:1. Have to drive to Waikiki for any interesting things.2. Front desk and Vallet almost never said hello.3. Had to keep curtains on side windows closed cause people on lanai could see in a little.4. Every night at 11pm they clean the beach and it's a little loud.5. Fridge was very tiny, could be a little bigger. This is a mini mini fridge.6. Beach in front of Hotel not the best beach for little kids. We never eat at the Restaurants there. And we never vallet parked. We discovered a good convenient store right by the Hotel. For everything else you have to commute.We would highly recommend this Hotel. We were very happy with our stay and will go back there next year. cs

<Content>Great value for this time of year. Ignore the negative comments, this is a great hotel if you are traveling in the summer months. The other hotels that are priced in the same price range does not compare to this hotel. The best part about the hotel is the cleanliness, the quiet, the comfortable beds and the beautiful lobby. Just spent seven days at the New Otani Kaimana and we couldn't be more pleased with what we got for the price. We would say the location was secluded and elegant: you're about two or three blocks from the main strip of Waikiki but far enough that you can get away and have a quiet night's rest -- the main strip can get a little busy and common after a while. The open, airy lobby extends right through to the back where you can see the beach and the restaurant. The beach here is much less crowded than the ones on the main strip. The standard rooms are pretty small but this was not a problem for us. Plus who spends all there time in there room when you are in Hawaii. Our room was super clean and we were greeted with a complimentary pineapple in the fridge which we did not eat sorry to say we both don't like pineapple too much . We had spotless, heavy, white sheets on a thick mattress with two wonderful pillows. When we woke up, we opened our terrace door and all you could hear was the wind, the rustling of the trees and water -- very quiet. We were provided a morning local newspaper every morning which was great to find out what was going on locally. The one thing we did find peculiar is the louvered bathroom door, which leaves little privacy as you can hear through the door. Towels were thick and clean, bathroom products are all by Neutrogena. They do have Internet access and other amenities available if needed. The staff was polite especially the valet guys who were very cheerful every day. We will defnitely stay here again.

<Content>Great place to stay! I loved it!We had a great room with a free upgrade to the honeymoon suite. We were there on our anniverary for 2 days before we left on the Pride of Hawaii cruise ship and needless to say, I would have rather just stayed here at this hotel than the ship. It was so nice and I felt like a part of the family. We had the nicest suite in the hotel I think, it was their honeymoon suite that was huge and spacious. Two of our whole walls where sliding glass doors that consisted of about 6 of them that just radiated with beauty. Our outside balcony was L shape so it was huge as well.We could see the ocean and look to the right and see the running park and Diamond Head Park. We were walking distance to the Aquarium, Diamond Head, shopping and the beach was right below us. Each morning we would run the trail at the park right in front then go to a coffee shop the hotel had off to the side and had coffee and pastries as we sat on the bench watching the waves and birds right by the beach and sand as we relaxed after the run. Ugh, I would go back in a heart beat. The room was so clean and we had robes to use that were very comfy.We ate at the Lanai Rest there and it was the best pasta we had ever had. My husband couldn't get enough. This was the most romantic suite and place/view I have ever experienced. We give it 5 stars... 20 if we could :-)

<Content>Great stay! We stayed four nights in June 2006. We found the hotel staff to be wonderful. It is an attractive hotel (especially the lanai dining area!) and very convenient. We stayed in a Junior Suite (married couple with adult child) facing Diamondhead. It was very quiet. Heard absolutely nothing except each other. It was very spacious, attractive, clean. Also air conditioned. We had the package deal (stay four nights, get the fourth night free plus $100 credit in hotel restaurants or bar).

<Content>We loved our stay! We don't understand some of the bad reviews of this hotel. Now that we are home, our best memories are of the walks to Waikiki - morning (get your coffee at the Honolulu Coffee Company!) for coffee and sunset walks for dinner. So perfect. I almost didn't want to enter a good review to keep the hotel a secret!They are small, but how much time do you spend in your room anyway?Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful.Don't forget to visit the east and north shores...good day trips.

<Content>A marvelous place I cannot believe anyone could not have an enjoyable time at the New Otani. We've stayed here a half a dozen times, from one night to four nights. We usually begin or end or trip to the islands here. Very relaxing, helpful and professional staff. Remarkable location, quiet and away from the action down the road. Even though we're there only once a year, some of the staff remembers us, and they obviously spread the word that we are returning guests. The rooms are clean and the views--whether on the Diamond Head side or oceanfront--could not be better. Several times we have been upgraded to a larger room, and one year they did not charge us for the second day because we checked out at 2 pm to catch a plane. How's that for service!The Hau Tree Lanai is a great dining experience, breakfast, lunch and dinner. The bar is pleasant. What else could you want.

<Content>Not a typical Waikiki beach hotel First of all, the location could be an advantage or disadvantage depending upon your interests....for me,I love the Waikiki beach scene so it was a bit remote for me. Also, expect to pay more to get back to the airport.Staff is efficient, helpful and friendly - though almost too efficient. I left my cellphone in my hotel, checked out and realized that and went back into the room to find that housekeeping already took it. Had to leave immediately to catch my airport shuttle - So I had to wait a week to get it back snail mail. Another drawback is that there are absolutely no services in the room. There aren't enough outlets to plug your stuff in, or the outlet for the computer is located on the other side of the room from the internet access cable. There is no coffeemaker and no place to get coffee (or shop for essentials) during the off hours. However, if you want quiet, your own private beach at a price competitive with the bigger chains on the beach, this is the place to stay.

<Content>Hated The New Otani Kaimana Beach  Although the lobby and restaurant at the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel in Honolulu are attractive, the sleeping rooms are a great disappointment. They are absurdly small and cramped - suited only for people of very small stature and not for tall Americans like my husband and myself. Even the height of the sink was absurdly low. Our view overlooking the park and the oceanfront was nice until the bars closed in Waikiki - then the party moved to the park under our window and that was the end of trying to sleep. Unfortunately, this happened every night because every night is Saturday night in Waikiki. There were no amenities whatsoever in this hotel - not even internet access - and the staff could have cared less about our complaints. The very high price charged for our room would have been much better spent elsewhere.

<Content>Nice - needs some investment For as much as they are charging at this truly delightful place, I would hope they are planning on adding a few amenities. It is on a great beach. The food was fantastic, as were the Mai Tais. The staff was very nice. The location was perfect.But aesthetically, it's stuck in 1972. The beds are not so great. The rooms need some work. The bathrooms are the small tile kind and t-i-n-y. And I had a suite.I'd stay there again, but for the price I'll be shopping before my next trip.I'll still go back for the Mai Tais though. ;-)

<Content>peaceful, pleasant Early October 2005 we stayed in a room facing Diamond Head; the view was so beautiful I didn't want to close the drapes. Rooms are modest but adequate. Quiet location, but really close to all the action in Waikiki. Great beach and swimming just out the front door. Beachside restaurant you shouldn't miss even if you don't stay here. Check the hotel's website for best prices. Taxi from airport recommended; this is the last shuttle stop, it takes quite a time to get there.

<Content>Great hotel, no complaints at all I was worried about staying here after reading some of the reviews here but I had a great stay here. It is at the very Diamond Head end of Waikiki, but it is really only a short walk into town. If you are going to the way other end of Waikiki it is a long walk, my freinds were staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village so to meet them there was somewhat difficult, but it was easy to get to Central Waikiki. I had a room with 2 twin beds to myself. The room was smaller than the Hilton, but it really was enough, I was barely in the room ever. The beach in front of the hotel is also very nice. It's blocked off from the main beach by some sort of run down war memorial so for part of the walk to town, you can't walk along the beach.Another review said there were bugs in the room but I didn't see any. Someone also complained about the A/C, it is a modern unit with digital temperature controls I was quite comfortable even with it right over the bed. Since it is a smaller hotel, service is much more personal. Also the restaurant is excellent. I had a four course prix fixe meal which was the best I had my whole trip.

<Content>Best Snorkeling in Waikiki! We stayed here in June, 05. The hotel room was small but roomy enough for two of us. It was very clean and not a bug in site! The staff: Chris and Roger at the bell desk and Angela the maid were great. The beach here is worth the extra dollars, one day we saw at least 20 different fish with our snorkel equipment, and didn't have to drive to get there! Please get some surf/sand shoes, the small coral pieces are hard to walk on. It was far enough from the main Waikiki crowd to feel private and close enough to walk to. The beautiful Kapiolani Park is another plus for this hotel. You can watch/participate in cycling, frisbee football, volleyball and picnics galore. We'd stay here again!

<Content>Older nice hotel but too remote Visited the Kaimana Beach Hotel for two nights at the end of our trip in Hawaii. The valet service ($12) was very prompt and reasonable, the beach was beautiful and the front desk upgraded us to an ocean view jr.suite when the jr. suite we booked facing diamond head was not available. The open air lanai restaurant was very nice.The hotel is in definate need of modernizing and the furniture, lighting, carpeting, etc.. is outdated, but it was clean, quiet and had great maid service/turn down service at dusk that was nice.The only thing that I didn't like a lot was how far we were from Waikiki. It is a pretty long walk for the average person (it is located past the aquarium) and I didn't feel comfortable going for a nightcap stroll down to the heart of Waikiki dreading the walk back. The hotel bar closes around 10:30 pm and there is nothing left to do at that end Waikiki if you want any night life whatsover.If you like the remoteness, have a rental car and aren't upset about your bedroom furniture age, the hotel could work for you. I just prefer to be closer to the action and touristy stuff.

<Content>Getting to know you... Having stayed and enjoyed my experiences at this hotel in the past I was interested in seeing what changes if any had ocurred during the past couple of years. I had booked a Garden View w/kitchenette for fourteen nights. Upon driving up to the hotel I became concerned at the onset when I gazed at the Valet Parking desk. It was badly in need of immediate replacement. Entering the lobby I gazed at the ceiling and was attracted by the many water stained tiles. The Room Clerk (Male) that checked me in was extremely surley and most sarcastic. My other dealings at the front desk during my stay with other personell were uneventful and for the most part pleasent.The room, though clean looked very much in need of a complete replacement, from furniture to the wallpaper to the flooring. The room looked as though it was never touched once since the hotel opened. I guess you could call it tacky. Since we only slept there, it was okay. The A/C was positioned almost over the bed, high on the wall. It was noisey and could never be controlled properly to keep the cold breeze from hitting you in the face. The bed was not all that comfortable and the mattress should have been replaced long ago. The rooms are small and takes a bit of getting used to. The Television set is placed at an angle to the bed which makes it most agrivating to watch unless one is sitting on the bed facing the set. The chambermaids were wonderful and very accommodating. Their efforts in keeping the room clean left nothing to be desired.Most of the hotel personel that we came in contact with were very pleasent and tried their best to be friendly and helpful. We did not eat any meals in the hotel except for a daily breakfast that was included with the price of the room. Breakfast at the New Otani, is not to be missed. The food was well prepared and served by excellent waiters.Of course the location of the hotel in Kapiolani Park is it's biggest attribute. It's far enough away from the noise and tumult of Waikiki which is only a fifteen minute walk away.In summing up it was very obvious to me and some of the people I confered with that the hotel is in dire need of a renovation. Would I stay here again? Yes, if management makes the necessary changes that in my opinion are needed, The New Otani would then be a three or four star hotel. Right now the best I can give it would be a one and a half or two stars at the very most.

<Content>Great oceanfront find! We had the opportunity to stay a real find near Waikiki, the New Otani Kaimana hotel. The hotel is small, but very clean with a friendly and responsive staff. It faces Sans Souci beach at the base of Diamond Head, offering a smaller sandy beach than Waikiki, but not as busy. The restaurant over-looking the beach offers scrumptious dinners. Although our room was relatively small, I'd recommend this hotel for the budget minded traveller who wants clean accomodations and great service without the high price tags of the neighboring skyrise Waikiki hotels. It's a real find!

<Content>Great Location For Me I was in Honolulu for business and stayed here since it's where my boss usually stays. I was impressed with the friendliness of the valet staff, the front desk, and also at any time I needed help from any member of the team. My room was very large, (301) but the view was of the parking lot. This was a one bedroom suite and had separate living/sleeping area, microwave, sink, large refrigerator, and a very large lanai. It was a short walk from my room to a safe, calm beach and just moments from Waikiki nightlife. I would definitely return.

This hotel is away from the hustle  bustle of Waikik, but close enough to get to everything. It was Memorial Day weekend  the park next door was full, but our room was very quiet. No problems at all. The Hau Tree Restaurant was super. We would stay here again. Check it out.

<Content>You might want to look at other spots Before booking this hotel I recommend you look at all your options. These are the Pros:1. You are on a somewhat private beach, on the weekends the beach is crowded. 2. There is a quiet park where you can relax.3. Excellent customer service.4. Excellent views of the beach and Diamond HeadThe Cons:1. The room is really small2. There was not an air vent in the bathroom3. You have to pay for your safety box ($3 a day)4. The furniture is extremely outdated5. It gets very cold with the AC on at night, no matter what temperature you have it on. 6. Over priced resturants in the hotel.7. A long walk to the main strip (you will have to go to the main strip for a cheaper meal everytime you want to eat. This is atleast a 15 minute walk. 8. Too many rocks in the ocean on this somewhat private beach.9. If you book excursions, they don't always pick you up at the this specific hotel. 10. If you want to party at night, then book a place on the main strip, this place is too long of a walk if you're leaving a club or bar at 1 or 2 in the morning.Excursions: (Book all excursions when you get there, it is alot CHEAPER to book there)1. Paradise Cove Luau - This was a great luau, very fun and entertaining2. Star of Honolulu Dinner Cruise - Waste of money, bad entertainment, and the food was not great. 3. Pali Makani Helicopter Ride - It is not worth $120 a person for 30 minutes.4. You can book a flight to the other island with a car for $180 a person.5. Diamond Head - This is great exercise, it takes 45 minutes to climb the mountain.

<Content>#1 Premium Oahu! I visited this hotel in mid March of '05. I didn't get to dine at either of the hotel's over-priced restaurants, I didn't even get to have a drink at their bar on account of the fact that they close super early, but the bartender was nice enough to direct me to the W next door, which was probably even more over-priced than their own bar. I did enjoy being kind of far away from all the noise of Waikiki, but still within easy walking distance. I recommend taking something heavy with you to the room at night (ie. a two liter of soda, nice and heavy so you can club any attackers over the head). It is some amount of comfort, however that it is one of the safest cities in the union. The rooms of the hotel are very small, but they cram everything you need right in there, even a flat screen television. The staff was very friendly, they even supply umbrellas for rainy days. I found the water pressure to be fine comparred to other travellers reviews. My only complaint is the fact that our room was plagued by tiny insects that we never got around to complaining about, I'm sure they would've taken care of it promptly though. All in all though, I think I'd stay here again in the future, as long as the price is right.

<Content>Great bargain out of the Waikiki bustle I recently stayed at the The New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel for a small meeting and left feeling I'd discovered a bargain gem in Waikiki. Small, quiet, right on the beach (not across the street from the beach or one block from the beach) and with an above average restaurant and attentive staff. I highly recommend it.The New Otani is located outside the busy main drag of Waikiki, separated from the last strip hotels (like Aston Waikiki) by acres of park land where the zoo, aquarium, and old natitorium are located. The street swings out from the ocean in that area, giving the beach a little more depth than along some more public areas of Waikiki. The beach is protected by some reef making it very swimmable and providing some snorkling interest out from the shore. The walk along the ocean front to the main Waikiki area is about 10 minutes and very pleasant, but when you go back home, it is quiet enough to hear the waves.There is an open air lobby with a bar, a very nice restaurant right on the beach, and a Japanese restaurant one level up. The rooms and exterior are dated in decor (though public areas have been spruced up) but comfortable and clean. Bathrooms are small. Some rooms are small, but I had a deluxe ocean front room that opened right to the ocean on one wall and straight up to the lights of Waikiki on another. The wrap around balcony was spacious. I highly recommend the rooms ending in 17 (317, 417, etc.) for the best views. If you don't want the mob scene and are looking for a good bargain, check this one out.

<Content>Tiny, Tiny rooms This is definitely a 鈥渂argain travelers鈥?hotel! This hotel is about as far off the beaten path as you can get. Bring your walking shoes or a car. The description that the hotel gives is 鈥溾€nly two blocks from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.鈥?Not sure how they measure a block. It is quite a long walk. I kind of enjoyed not being in heart of town. Surrounded by parks, zoo and aquarium. I enjoyed my long daily walks to get meals. It is strange to be in a beach front hotel with no access to the beach. You have to walk out the front of the hotel and around the side to get to the beach. Staff was very nice. My main complaints are that the rooms are crazy small and the doors have a commercial closing mechanism that causes the doors to slam hard every time you enter or leave your room. If you are asleep and someone down the hall leaves, you WILL be woken up. Also not to fond of the nickel and dime charges. $11 a day for internet access (talk about sticking it to you), $12 a day for parking (valet only), $2 a day to use the in room safe (free at most hotels because 98% of all in room theft is committed by hotel staff. Seems strange to charge me to protect me against their own staff). I guess this is kind of normal for this area. If you just need an old hotel to take a shower at and don鈥檛 plan on spending much time there (or ironing cloths for that matter, no ironing board), this may be for you.

<Content>Sad to see favorite changing Have always loved this place, usually get a room facing the Natatorium  don't find the rooms too small at all. The oceanfront rooms on Kaimana Beach are just wonderful. The restaurant is good, particularly for lunch. But in the past I've most enjoyed Kaimana Beach  the park area around the hotel, and the past two stays have been so disrupted at the beach and park by the beach shop the hotel rents to. They drag tourists' surf boards right over your towel, give lessons in the water next to your head, and shout like mad. They also hang around the park area outside the shop and either glare at people or goof off loudly. One almost hit me pulling out of the parking area. I complained to the hotel and they said they just rent space to them. For the price, this place is hard to beat. But if this doesn't improve there's no point in trying to enjoy this beautiful beach and I'll stay elsewhere.

<Content>Small We stayed at the New Otani Last August 2004. I went with my husband and son. The staff was extremely pleasant and thoughtful,however the rooms were very tiny and cramped. My son still thought it was nice. The view and scenary were spectacular. You could see a closeup or overview of the beach. I thought the decor was nice but has a run down feeling. We tried the room service once and the pizza was inedible. Overall I thought the rooms were too cramped but we spent too much time at the beach and going to other places to think about it.

<Content>quiet with good service but small rooms I just got back from a week's stay at the New Otani. Our room had a partial view of the beach from one side of the balcony and a great view of Diamond Head from the other, but it was very small. I was sharing the room with my brother and we were right on top of each other. The bathroom also was not ventilated so the door had vents resulting in a lack of privacy when using the bathroom. I would advise someone to only share such a room with a partner or spouse! Aside from this the place was great, a short walk through a gorgeous park to the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and right on a beach with amazing sand that is a little less crowded than the rest of Waikiki's beaches. The restaurant at the hotel has an amazing view of the beach but the prices seem to reflect this. For not being a very upscale hotel compared to all the fancy hotels on the strip, the menu was surprisingly pricey, especially for dinner. But everyone there was very friendly and eager to help with directions, advice and arranging tours. If you can stay in one of the larger rooms, or don't mind the lack of privacy in the small ones, It's a great place to stay on crowded Waikiki without feeling too overwhelmed by the overpopulated and touristy aspects of the main strip.

<Content>Outstanding I love this hotel. I spent only one night there in March 2004 and have to say, this is my favorite hotel in the Waikiki area. Yes it is a little out of the way, but that's a good thing -- no noise, no crowds, nice neighborhood. The hotel pays exceptionally good attention to its guests. The staff is very attentive, and no request is unreasonable -- they extended by checkout time to 5pm for free.The location is great. Not only is the hotel on the beach, it has its own beach with great swimming and some good snorkeling. Sans Souci beach is uncroweded and a local favorite. When I lived in Hawai'i I would go there to avoid the crowds of Waikiki and Ala Moana beaches. The partial ocean view rooms are excellent because they have an unobstructed view of the beach and the city and mountains.This hotel pays exceptional attention to detail and customer satisfaction. They have an excellent location. Most of all the hotel is an exceptional value -- our partial ocean view room was about $170.I cannot recommend this hotel enough. It is the most relaxing place I've stayed in Honolulu. Love it. Will return.

<Content>One of the Best! Service was great, food was also nice at the hotel. Though the room was on the small side, the views were breathtaking! Just a tip, when arriving at the Honolulu airport spend the extra money for a taxi that will take you directly to the hotel. If you try to save money and go on a bus where everyone else is trying to get to their hotel, keep in mind you will be dropped off LAST! This transfer can be about 2 hours but on the otherhand it's like touring Honolulu and you can get a good idea of where interesting places are located.

<Content>A brief but great time We (a family of 5) were looking for a hotel on the beach for the last night of our vacation. We found a great rate on the hotel's web site. The hotel upgraded our original reservation from 2 deluxe ocean view rooms to 1 deluxe ocean view and 1 junior suite ocean view. In addition to offering great views of the ocean and all of Waikiki, both rooms were large, well furnished, clean, quiet, and very comfortable. Although we had requested non-smoking rooms, ash trays were present, but we did not detect any tobacco odor. The beach was quiet and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We also had a wonderful dinner in their outdoor restaurant. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel for people looking for a great value in a quieter section of Waikiki.

<Content>What a treat! After reading some of the reviews on this site, I was more than a little concerned about our hotel choice. We arrived June 5th for our 25th anniversary vacation. We explained what we had read about the tiny rooms and the clerk looked to see what could be done. We were upgraded (at no add'l charge) for 3 nights of our 4 night stay to a delux ocean view, she explained the hotel was booked after that, we were happy to have it for that long. The view was breathtaking. Then when we returned from our journey around the island on the 4th night, we were happy to see our new room. A Jr. suite with a wonderful view of Diamond Head. What a great stay we had. The staff were all so friendly and helpful. We ate at the resturaunt (downstairs)and watched the sunset over the beach. The prices were no more expensive than any hotel here. If you don't have spending money why are you going to Hawaii? Oh, if you want a coffee pot in your room, just ask. We didn't find out til the 3rd day. Make no mistake, this is not a new hotel, but it was always clean and the turn down service is refreshing.The walk to the hustle and bustle of town is just a 10-15 minute walk. We always felt safe and we walked as late as 1 am. This is the perfect location for that quiet getaway. If you want to take the kids think about staying in town, but want romance? This little beach is perfect!

<Content>NEW OTANI KAIMANA BEACH HOTEL Outstanding! I have been in the travel business for 15 years and have stayed at more hotels then I can count and I can鈥檛 say enough about the staff and location. Even the people vacationing and the locals we met on the beach were wonderful. We first stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki which I liked because of the location, I thought until we moved to the New Otani Kaimana Beach. Yes, it is down by the Aquarium and Zoo but we really enjoyed walking along the beach and into Waikiki and leaving the crowds behind when we chose too and you can鈥檛 do that if you鈥檙e staying on the strip. The Otani is right on the beach and has the best snorkeling, surfing and sunset鈥檚 in Waikiki! I grew up on Oahu and have gone every year and I will no longer stay at the big hotels which I though was the only place to stay. I will only stay at the Otani. There website doesn鈥檛 give the hotel justice. My only suggestion would be to go to the ABC store and invest in a sand chair it is well worth it.

<Content>Romantic, Quite, and the Best in Diamond Head! The Best!!! Kalona's best pick for Hawaii. If you want Quite, Affordable, Romantic, and away from the crowds of Waikiki this is my pick. The staff is full of Aloha. The bar is great! Beach front for the sunset walks or sitting on the beach.

<Content>The Staff is the best, The staff is really the nicest people You could meet.True spirit of Aloha. You can't say nothing good about the rest of the place. The rooms are to small, They reeked of cigarette smoke, and everything else like dirty feet. The prices are to expensive, and the Japanese guest are very rude. Also You are treated like a second class citizen compared to the Japanese Tourist. Very Racist. The beach is nice, the park is nice, but You could walk from Wikiki to that beach in ten minutes. So I would definetly not go back there again.
