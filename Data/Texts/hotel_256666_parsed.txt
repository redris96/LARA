<Content>Excellent place to stay for business in downtown Sydney My colleagues from work regularly stay at this hotel. It offers spacious and comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.The location is great - near Darling Harbour. We easily walked back from dining there.If I get to go back to Sydney with my family, I would stay here.

<Content>Give apartment hotels a try-best of both worlds After 2 weeks on a cruise, our expectations were high. York knocked our socks off with the deluxe studio apartment. We were on the 6th floor and if outside on our spacious patio-there was street noise. We were, after all, in the heart of Sydney! But not after closing the sliding glass doors. We place a high value on quiet, size, good looks, safety, terrific king bed with bathroom almost larger than our cruise stateroom-incredible kitchen! We happened to mention we had trouble with the washer and the next day it was programmed for a speedier cycle for us. BTW-no fee laundry-in our bathroom. Staff were friendly and very accommodating.We were close to Everything and once we mastered the transport in town, we even took the rail to the gorgeous Blue Mtns. I would only recommend getting your emails at Woolworths-fast and $5! Hotels need to get 'real' on their computer/internet pricing. Apartment hotels are definitely what I'll be looking for from now on. If we didn't want to cook, there were local places next door.

<Content>Great Location, Friendly staff Very friendly staff. Room was very tidy and clean. The hotel has a very nice pool, spa and sauna. The location is 5-10 minutes walk from the Rocks and Circular Quay. Although on a map it appears close to a freeway, I could not see it or hear it at all from anywhere in the hotel. Only thing I really didn't like was the mirrors in the elevators. Made me feel a little uncomfortable when travelling with strangers.

<Content>Great place to stay for travel with Babies We stayed at The York apartments for 6 days in October. It was great. Quite spacious, comfortable beds, modern and clean. The location is fantastic. It is so easy to get everywhere.. darling harbour, circular quay, the opera house, the ferries and the shopping! I really recommend it. We stayed there with a baby and asked for a cot and high chair and it was all easily accommodated. I also rate the staff highly. Nothing was ever a bother to them and they were extremely friendly. These apartments are great value for money in the heart of Sydney. Oh and we also used the spa and it was wonderful :) The pool looked good too but a bit too cool to check that out while we were there.

<Content>Well located self contained apartments We chose the York as we were travelling with a toddler and wanted a self contained apartment which was walking distance to the city centre. We were not on a recreational trip to Sydney, and when we are we usually stay in self contained apartments out at Bondi.Our apartment had been partially renovated with fresh new carpet and paint in the living areas and bedroom.While the bathrooms and kitchen were a little dated they were very clean and perfectly adequate for our requirements. The apartment was quite spacious and while definately not 5 star it was very good value given its central location. If I was to recommend this hotel, I would suggest asking for one of the higher floors (we were on level 9) as the traffic noise was quite considerable when we had the windows open. The hotel is well located with respect to The Rocks and Darling Harbour however if you're planning to walk I would suggest comfortable shoes!!

<Content>Excellent location and great place to stay Booked this because of the location and the need for two bedrooms for our family holiday. We were not dissapointed. Very well appointed and clean appartment and very helpful staff. The location is great with the Rocks opera house and harbour 10-15 mins away with Darling Harbour only 20 odd mins walk. Train station and supermarket just around the corner.Swimming pool, sauna and Jaccuzi comes in handy after a hard day being a tourist. Gym needs to be upgraded though as the machines didnt realy work.A very good place to stay and we would stay there again.

<Content>Amazing City Centre Apartments At the end fo our epic Australian adventure we wanted to end on a high so booked this place. We were all amazed at just how great the accomodation was, I booked a 2 bedroom executive room with Study and it was like a film set, huge spacious rooms, 2 balconies, large kitchen area and lounge and an amazing view towards the Bridge. Although slightly expensive I reckon it was great value, you are within walking distance of everything, the staff were very helpful and freindly and you will be hard pressed to find better all round self catering accomodation anywhere in Sydney.

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel The York is a remarkably good property - provided you can book into the higher floors (eg. 16 +). The staff are courteous and helpful. Check in/out is fast and hassle free. My room was very clean, light and bright, recently refurbished in mod colours and serviced daily. The 2 bedroom deluxe has an enormous living area and main bedroom, plus every kitchen appliance (huge 'fridge), washing machine  dryer. You really do have everything included in these rooms.Sliding doors enable access to balconies for fresh air and al-fresco dining. Great to sit there watching the north Sydney skyline at night. The location is close to everything - Wynyard station, Circular Quay, the Bridge, Coles Express, etc. If you don't feel like cooking walk around the corner to the Travelodge for good simple meals at very reasonable prices. The northern city location is away from the traffic  hoons of the central/southern city areas. Having a free car park in the same building is amazing value - just take the lift down to the parking areas on the lower floors. The only potential problem would be the traffic noise coming off the 10 lane approach road to the Harbour Bridge. I noticed it some nights on the 18th floor - but my travel partner said it was very quiet. The lower rooms could be very noisy for some - upper rooms are perfect. Double glazing would be a good idea.For me the York was all good, no complaints at all and excellent value at $290 per night . Just make sure you get the higher rooms.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised I have to say we were pleasantly surprised when we opened the apartment door. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the tower was built in the 1970s and has a hideous, boring brown colour reminiscent of many of the high-rise buildings of that time. Secondly, we had seen a couple of bad reviews on TripAdvisor and we were sceptical about the place. We had booked the two bedroom apartment in the Deluxe Category for a decent price, considering it was the Australia Day long weekend. Upon entering the room, we found that it had been fully renovated and all of the appliances and furnishings were quite new. The apartment was spacious and tastefully decorated, with clean bathrooms and large balconies. This was a positive start. Another good point about this hotel was that with each apartment you book, you receive a free, secure undercover parking space. The car park is tight and somewhat confusing (because of the RESERVED signs that are placed in front of 90% of the spaces), but for a free spot so close to Circular Quay we can't complain. While the York is close to the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, it is at least a 20-30 minute walk to Darling Harbour and the Aquarium. Because we have already seen all of the major attractions in Darling Harbour, and because we normally drive to Sydney, I would most probably stay here again. For an overseas tourist however, they may consider staying somewhere more Central (ie somewhere in between Circular Quay and Darling Harbour).

<Content>Great Stay We stayed at the York Hotel for a long weekend and had a wonderful time. We booked a one-bedroom appt on hotelclub.com, and were very pleased with the accommodation. The hotel even phoned a few days before to check we hadn't forgotton the booking. They were in easy walking distance (even with luggage) from Wynyard station, and were a 10 min walk from Darling Harbour, and 5 min walk from Circular Quay.We have been to Sydney a few times now, so knew which area we would be spending the most amount of time in for this trip, and it was perfect. Whilst we were on a low floor, and the view was not amazing, the noise from the traffic was not too bad. The pool and sauna were in a lovely setting and even in slightly cool weather it was worth a dip.We only had a small hassle with the power tripping in the appt, and that was rectified immediately once we had informed the management.Will definately stay there again, and have recommended it to colleagues at work.

<Content>Near Perfect Place to Stay The York Apartment Hotel is a near perfect place to stay in Sydney. We booked a 2-bedroom deluxe apartment and was upgraded to an Executive Two Bedroom / 2 Bathroom on the top floor. The view from the beautifully furnished apartment and the 2 balconies was spectacular. The kitchen had a full compliment of utensils, etc. When a bottle of wine packed in my luggage broke in transit, I really appreciated the washer and dryer in the unit. There is a small supermarket within a block as well as several restaurants nearby. Although The York is within walking distance to many attractions, there is a train station around the corner that goes to most other places in the CBD (central business district). We bought a day pass that included the train, buses, and ferries. We took the ferry to Manly late afternoon, had dinner in Manly, and returned to Sydney at night with a fantastic night view of the city and opera house.

Not only was the location fantastic, but the staff was incredible in their flexibility to accomodate us and our needs. Super easy onto the Harbour bridge, everything in walking distance.

<Content>perfect! We stayed here for 5 nights at the end of a 3 week tour of Australia and thought it fantastic! We were in room 909, a deluxe studio on the 9th floor. Were a little disappointed at first not to be higher (I think the apartments are on the higher floors) but the view we had was great - could see the AMP tower. A little noisy on the balcony, but you expect that in a city, We spent quite a lot of time out there. Inside was beautiful, clean, modern and spacious with full kitchen, bath and seperate shower and washer and dryer - a godsend! We even used the pool and hot tub, no-one else there! Location - 10 mins walk to the Rocks and Circular Quay, 15 mins to Darling Harbour - easy. Good, cheap noodle bar round the corner. Staff very helpful. Our flight home was in the evening - staff stored our luggage and we were able to use the showers by the pool - towels provided, which was great - didn`t feel like we had nowhere to go! Would definitely stay there again given the chance.

<Content>nice place, good value, comfortable Hidden gem for long term stay in Sydney CBD. For business, I've spent many 2-3 week stays in the CBD and the York was the fifth place I've tried.. and where I'll stay from now on. Location is great, a block from the Wynward CityRail station. The staff is nice and willing to accomidate any request. They now offer broadband wireless internet at the very reasonable rate of $50 AUD/week. As long as you are on the 8th floor or above, street noise as mentioned in other reviews isn't any more than a typical urban city. Full kitchen and laundry en suite. Housekeeping efficent. VERY NICE BALCONIES, even pleasent during the winter on sunny days. Would recommend.

<Content>York apartments and staff were excellant Protano's  Kelly Wigan England.We were in Australia for our daughters wedding and because the apartment was so spacious, it was used as the meeting place for eveyone who had travelled out there. We had a girls night before the wedding and then we had everyone around for drinks before setting off to see the fireworks at New Year.The apartment was cleaned every day and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. If we are ever lucky enough to reurn to Australia we will definitely return to the York Apartments as will some of the people who visited us there, they were very impressed. Thank you very much we had a memorable time in comfort.

<Content>Great Value and Location Our family stayed here for a week over xmas 2007. This hotel is in an excellent location with great amenities. It is a 2 minute walk to train station and supermarket. A 10 minute walk into town or darling harbour or to the wharf (to catch ferry to manly) .We were on level 20 and our room was very clean , tidy and modern and was serviced every day. Our balcony (with outdoor table and chairs) had partial view of harbour bridge and other way was into city and centrepoint tower. There was no road noise. The pool facility was great with a shallow ledge perfect for our children (aged 2  5), many hotels we have stayed at recently with pools have not been suitable for kids so this was great. There was also a spa pool of good size and most times we were the only people in the pool. The staff were very helpful, we arrived late evening on an international flight and then had early morning check out on day we left. Housekeeper was very accomodating if we weren't going out till later in day. Definately will stay here again on our next visit to Sydney. We visited the aquirium, maritime museum, powerhouse musuem, opera house, went on monorail at Darling Harbour and mini train around botanic gardens. All great activities for all ages. Being busy time of year morning visits were best to avoid crowds then back to hotel for use of pool in afternoon. I recommend taking the train to Chatswood for those who like shopping. A simple xmas touch of santa hat filled with lollies made our children feel like home away from home during the festive season

<Content>Wonderful value We spent a week at the York apartment hotel and thought the accommodation was exceptional value for money (we were upgraded!). Enormous rooms, with the added benefit of two balconies - if you dared to go out on them - we were on the 26th floor. Our apartment was very well equipped, making it possible to cook, wash, iron etc. Rooms well serviced each day, by very friendly staff.Reception staff varied, but most were very pleasant. Concierge staff helpful booking taxis etc.Good location - close to the Rocks, Circular Quay, the bridge etc and we did not experience any traffic noise.Supermarket close by, as well as loads of cafes, restaurants etc.Would DEFINITELY stay there again.

<Content>Good value for families, but caution advised... We spent five nights at the York at the end of July, and overall had a positive experience. The location was ideal -- within walking distance to the Rocks and Circular Quay. Our deluxe two bedroom 2 bath on the 21st floor had a decent partial view of the Harbor Bridge -- an advance request that the hotel staff kindly accommodated. Having a kitchen with all the amenities helped cut down some of our family's food budget, at least for breakfast. The rooms were nicely renovated, though we weren't thrilled with the choice of art and the extensive use of red in all furnishings. My only real beef was with the staff, who were not rude per se, but also not terribly pleasant or helpful either. You should especially be very very careful before signing your credit card slip at the check-out. They showed me my bill, which I examined and said it was fine. Subsequently they took my credit card to run it through, handed me the slip and in one breath, asked me to sign. Thankfully, by some divine intervention, I looked at the amount just before signing it, only to discover to my horror that it was $600 OVER the amount that was on my final bill! The young lady at the desk did not even apologize when I pointed it out to her. She simply said, Oh, let me change that for you. Meanwhile I could partly see her co-worker/supervisor in the background watching and listening to what was going on. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was not intentional or an organized plot. All I'm saying is, be careful, and review all charges and totals before you sign. Otherwise, enjoy the great location and request a higher floor to avoid the noise.

<Content>Loved the York We really enjoyed the York. We stayed 4 nights. We had booked the one bed flat, and the accommodation was very spacious and comfortable. There are some lovely touches, like reasonably stocked booked shelves. We were on the 9th floor; if I get to return, I'll ask for a much higher floor to get an even better view.Location is excellent if, like us, you're focused on the harbour/opera area, which is not far to walk to. It's a bit further to the wonderful botanical gardens, and the art gallery, but still doable by foot. There is a very good supermarket just down the road. You go into the station, and it's down one level or so.Heartily recommended.

<Content>Great Location We were looking for a convienient place to stay in Sydney with free parking. The York filled the bill. It is right off the Harbour Bridge, just a block from the Wynyard metro stop. Make sure you get your bearings heading to the hotel for check in, or else you will wind your way around the CBD. There is not a really convienient/marked spot to pull in/park for check in. We just pulled over on the road and put on the hazards. Check in was a breeze, and we were routed to the parking garage behind the apartments. Our room was on the 8th floor, 801. We were unable to get a room with views of the water, but we did have a nice big tree that was growing below our window that offered somewhat of a view from the balcony. The room was a studio and very light and lively. There was a great kitchen with a stove, dishwasher, microwave, fridge, and utensils. There was a small dining table and chairs, as well as a couch, coffee table, small chair, and entertainment center with VCR and CD player. The bed was as hard as a rock. As always, the bathroom was the best feature. It had a great big sink that was shallow with a giant mirror and glass shelf. A nice hairdryer was tucked underneath.There was a separate glassd in shower and bathtub. There was also a small washing machine and dryer. The bathroom was very spacious!We do not recommend going to the restaurant for breakfast. It is not worth the $25 per person buffet. They did serve a cooked breakfafst with eggs and bacon. Then there is a buffet with 2 kinds of bread, some fruit, yogurt, boxes of cereal, and 2 fruit juices. None of it was very good. The York is located within an convienient walk downhill to Circular Quay and the Rocks. It was a great location to get to where we wanted to go.

<Content>Reasonably pleasant stay Stayed one night in July on business. The Good : As per previous post, good location - very close to Rocks area and leisurely stroll away from Darling Harbour/CBD. Cafes/restaurants and seven elevens all within short walking distance. Free on site car parking from check in till 12 pm on day of check out. After 12 pm on day of check out, you pay $15.50. Very reasonable when compared with other hotel parking options. Apartment spacious (booked into the 1 bedroom), very clean, tastefully furnished and with everything you need. Kitchen not as well equipped as it could be, but still handy for making simple meals. Pool/spa area small, but clean and outfitted well. Pool small but heated. Heated spa very nice. Gym small with a few pieces of equipment - looked a little cramped to me. Service very pleasant and accommodating. Staff always asking if everything is OK and if you need help. The Not So Good : Difficult to locate especially when driving. Hotel located at the intersection of York and Margaret and if you miss it, you need to go one big round in the midst of busy Sydney traffic with its many narrow one way streets and weird traffic flows. Car park entrance on Margaret street, but you wouldn't know unless you asked. A bit noisy inside apartment and out. Constant traffic noise - not so bad if all windows and sliding doors closed, and if located on a high floor. As per previous post, balcony area not relaxing at all given the busy street frontage and associated noise. Within apartment itself, older model fridge gave off a constant low hum. Could hear plumbing and water heater noises from next apartment. All in all, a pleasant stay and would go back again if we got a good rate.

<Content>Great location, service  While I had stayed at this hotel in the past this is the first time in several years and I was very impressed at the recent renewal of the property. The location is outstanding being only a short walk from the Wynyard train station with direct train service to the airport and also onto the city circle route. Also easy shopping with a supermarket and a very good liquor store basically across the street. Also a very popular Japanese Noodle cafe next to the hotel. My room (1 bedroom) was very spacious and decorated in a very good manner.Both hotel and street noise were minimal to nil. Finally the cost was very good value given that small hotel rooms would cost nearly the same.Every staff person was friendly and helpful.I will definitely be staying there again and will highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in Sydney CBD.

<Content>very comfortable I stayed here for 6 nights April 27 - May 2. The location is great, close to Circular Quay and right in the CBD of Sydney. Depending on when you are staying in Sydney, that might not be the best location.It is pretty empty and quiet on the weekends.I stayed in a stdio apartment. The bed was reasonably comfortable, a little on the firm side. Huge balcony overlooking the pool. It lookedlike most apartments had some form of balcony. Very modern furniture,reasonably comfortable. The decor is very modern. The room had good sized kitchen facilities, dinning table, and even laundry facilities in the room! Great!Wireless internet is available from the hotel lobby and mezzanine level. It is a bit on the pricey side at $20/day or $50/week. I thinkthis is typical in Australia though, it seems like Internet in hotelsisn't as common as it is in North America.The staff was very helpful and professional. I will be staying somewhere else when I return to Sydney as I don't require the apartment style accommodations, but would not hesitate to recommend this place for anyone who does.

<Content>Central location at reasonable prices We booked a one bed deluxe apartment here, so that we would have a separate bedroom for our 18 month old, plus the option of being able to eat in. After searching for numerous apartments in Sydney, this seemed to be the best deal, plus it is in a central location. Although in the CBD, it is about 5 minutes walk to the Rocks, and about 15-20 to Darling Harbour.The staff were great  very helpful - we even managed to get a free upgrade to a 2 bed apartment, which was so spacious and very well equipped. When the kettle broke, a new one arrived within 10 minutes! We would definitely stay here again  recommend, expecially for families.

<Content>Excellent Hotel in an Excellent Location with Superb of the Harbour Bridge We ( 2 adults  2 children) stayed here for 3 nights on our return to Sydney prior to flying back to UK. Found the hotel by accident via a website search but couldn't have been happier. The room rate was extremely reasonable probably because the hotel was undergoing a refurbishment but the staff went to great lengths to minimise the impact on guests. We had a pretty spacious 2 bedroom apartment with 2 bathrooms, a kitchen and laundering facilities. Although the traffic made it a bit noisy sitting out on the balcony the view of Sydney Harbour Bridge was worth it - but we didn't mind the noise when, one evening, we were treated to a firework display. When we arrived in Sydney 3 weeks earlier we had stayed in a hotel on Darling Harbour but The York was so much better suited for a family. We enjoyed a couple of dips in the small roof top pool and, as our flight out was late in the day, the staff were very helpful and welcoming in storing our copious amounts of luggage as well as providing us with complimentary facilities to shower and change before leaving for the airport. I wish that New York and London had apartments of a similar quality that are as reasonably priced!

<Content>What a great city centre place to stay We booked 4 nights in a standard studio at The York many months in advance. we had been travelling for 5 weeks when we got to the York and were delighted when we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment on arrival. The space and the facilities were excellent. The kitchen was fully equipped and spacious. Bathroom was big with a washing machine/tumble drier in the corner. It probably seems boring but the opportunity for self catering and catching up on the laundry was very welcome. The open plan lounge was spacious and comfortable with satellite TV including many sport and film channels. We even had 2 balconies, one from the lounge and one from the main bedroom.A serviced apartment in a block like this is an excellent solution for a city centre. The location was really good being close to Circular Quay and The Rocks. There were plenty of shops, breakfast or lunch cafes and restaurants within minutes of the apartments. Room service meals were available from several restaurants adjacent to the apartments. You get much more space in an apartment and of course it is much cheaper. The staff ( basically reception and porters) were all very helpful and friendly. I will definitely recommend it to others.

<Content>Excellent accommodation in prime location We had been travelling for 3 weeks when we arrived in Sydney and needed somewhere central where we could self cater if need be and catch up with washing and ironing etc. We booked the York via the M-Power website for 3 seperate stays over a 10 day period and were not disappointed. The reception staff were very friendly and the concierge was extremely helpful. We booked a Standard Studio Apartment which was everything we needed with a great room layout and of course washing machine, dryer, iron and ironing board. Each time we left our heavy luggage was stored by the Reception staff and each time we returned we had a room upgrade ..... the first time to a 1 Bedroom Apartment and the second time to a Deluxe Studio which we thought was the best of the 3 apartments ...... the fittings and fixtures were of a high quality and a duvet on the bed not a quilt and blankets. The location was perfect just 10 minutes to Circular Quay, Darling Harbour, George St and Pitt St. Just 100 mtrs across the road there was a great Food Mall and the Supermarket was 5 minutes walk. If I return to this wonderful city in the future we will definitely stay at the York.

<Content>surprisingly very good + super location + parking !!! Was a bit reluctant when booking it, but we needed an apartment for 4 people, not a hotel room. This was the best I could find, and surprisingly, it turned out better than expected... The rooms are great, spacious, clean. The service is great. Apparently a lot of business people make it a stay for longer periods than a couple of days. The location is close to everywhere walking distance. The renovations are recent and successful. The only negative was that the old airconditioners smelled a bit at first, but if you let them run, the smell goes away. Highly recommended.

<Content>Great Hotel Apartments minutes from Circular Quay We stayed here twice on our trip to Australia this year and both times the hotel was fantastic. We requested when booking the accommodation for a newly decorated two bed apartment, as the hotel had flagged up that they where upgrading the accommodation. The rooms are well finished and always extremely clean. The kids enjoyed the pool and spa facilities. But best of all was the location, just a short stroll form Circular Quay and the Rocks, where you would double the price of hotel apartment accommodation! Save your money for spending in Sydney and stay at The York. Another great find were the two small Japanese canteens just to the right of the hotel, nothing-flashy just fantastic, cheap, honest Japanese food on the doorstep.You don't get the million dollar views but we would recommend The York 100% and we will be returning.

<Content>Roomy and good value My husband and I stay in Sydney often and we needed a one night break after the hectic lead up to Christmas so found the York Apartments on a last minte website. I considered it to be good value at AU$195 for the night, particularly as it was the night before New Year's Eve, because it also had complimentary parking. This is a huge bonus in Sydney as other hotels we have stayed we have paid anything from $20 - $40 per day. Fast friendly check-in. We were on the 5th floor and at first thought it would be noisy, but not at all, unless you opened the sliding door onto the balcony, but it still wasn't horrendous considering the hotel is so close to the Harbour Bridge. The room had obviously been recently refurbished and repainted. Very clean and a homey feel to it as there was quite an array of books adjacent to the eat-in area with decorative vases and bowls adorning the bookcase. I think for overseas visitors,who want to self-cater, there's a good size kitchen with dishwasher, microwave and oven, also washing machine and dryer in a separate area. Convenience stores are close by. No it's not 4 or 5 star quality but I would rather go for the roomy quality. It is centrally located - no more than 10 min walks to either The Rocks, Darling Harbour or central CBD/shopping. I would definitely stay there again and I would definitely recommend this property.

<Content>Excellent I stayed here in August and found it to be an excellent hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the maid service was superb. Having stayed in Sydney before I already knew the location and I have to say it's central to everything and you really can't get better. A 5 minute walk to circular quay and Wynyard Station (and the supermarket) , and George Street is literally across the road. The hotel is in the process of being refurbished but this didn't affect me in the slightest. I had a 1 bedroom deluxe apartment on the 6th floor which overlooked the pool area. Everything was clean, it was serviced every day and my maid even washed up for me which was an unexpected surprise. The kitchen is fully equipped, the bed extremely comfortable. All in all I couldn't fault it and on my return I received a nice letter from the Manager thanking me for filling out the standard questionnaire about the Hotel and hoping to see me there again. A nice touch I thought and good customer care which is hard to find these days.

<Content>Recommended We made our booking direct with the York apartments and specifically requested a non smoking, 2 king bed/2 bath, high floor and harbour view room and that's exactly what we got. The staff were friendly and check-in was quick and efficient. The lifts were being refurbished but there was minimal disruption to our stay. Our spacious apartment had just been refurbished so everything was brand new and the kitchen was fully stocked with crockery and utensils. We also had a balcony with great views of the Sydney skyline. We thought the York was in a good location for all major tourist places (10 mins to bridge and Opera House, 10 mins to the centre of Sydney) and the underground was a couple of minutes walk away. The supermarket and a couple of fast food places were located in the underground station so it wasn't very far to walk back with bags of groceries.I have no hesitation in recommending the York Apartments and would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Rather blah The modern room photos on the York's website were very misleading to us. The only thing new about our apartment was the huge bathroom that seemed to be newly refurbished. April 15-19 we stayed in room 1702, two bedrooms and one bath. We paid $315 on the Easter long weekend and $285 on our last night. (A bit pricey for outdated accommodations). After staying at the Meriton Rialto for 4 nights we were truly disappointed when we entered the York to find an old room, green and pink pastel paint, floral-pattered furniture that was dirty and outdated. The paint was chipping off the dining room furniture. The master bedroom was large but the air condioner was noisy when turned on. The second bedroom with two single beds was a reasonable size. It would have been nice if there was an extra luggage rack since we ended up using two chairs. The apartment was very spacious and had two balconies. After inquiring, the frontdesk told us that all the one bedroom apartments had already been renovated and that they would start on the two bedrooms later this year.The kitchen was adequate although we found the cutlery drawers quite dirty and washed everything in the kitchen before we used it. The oven had a note stuck on it, stating that it was out of order. The next day it was promptly fixed. Liked the broiler option on the oven. Location was good, short walk to the circular quays and subway station. Wynard station was a half block away and inside was a 24-hour Coles supermarket. Although one elevator was out of service, there was never much of a wait for the other two.Housekeeping was great. They even unloaded our dishwasher for us everyday after we left the apartment. Parking was free for one car during our stay. The York was adequate for our stay. Hopefully, they will renovate those tired rooms and perhaps we would try it again.

<Content>Mixed feelings Stayed at the York this Easter for three nights. Apartments are so much better than being cooped up in a hotel room. We were lucky enought to have a north facing room with views of the harbor on a weekend where the weather was perfect! We had two couples and one single and so booked a two bedroom apartment with a sofa bed in the lounge. The main bed room was enormous (no balcony but ensuite and huge). The second bedroom was miniscule. Two single beds with a bedside table between. One side the bed was right next to the wall and the other bed was right next to the wardrobe, which made it very difficult to access. This room smelt dreadfully of smoke like someone had shut themselves in there and smoked a packet. We spoke to reception and were given an ozoneator which helped a lot. This room might have suited a couple of little kids but was no fun for the unlucky other couple to draw the short straw. There was however access to the balcony.The lounge, dining and kitchen area were were fine. sunny, airy and spacious. There could have been a couple of extra kitchen utensils, try turning and retrieving fried eggs with a knife. The second bathroom was very small. You had to open the door and then get into the shower so you could shut the door. Our screen was broken but we fixed it.The location is very central to the CBD, trains ferries, the rocks, circular quay etc. Parking for one car was free. We were told that in order to get the sofa bed in the lounge we needed to take one of the older non refurbished units and that is exactly what we got. From memory there was a slight difference in price.The pool are was nice and the spa extremely good - hot and with great jets, just the thing after a day of walking. I would stay there again as for me the worst thing was the smoke smell and that wasn't their fault I guess. I would seek out the reburbished rooms though. A great alternative to a hotel. We paid $340 Aus per night.

<Content>A Really Pleasant Stay We stayed at the York for 26 nights, Feb 2006. We had a one bed apartment on the 6th floor overlooking Jamieson street and St Philips church. Everything was better than we had expected, and thought it was good value for money. Staff at all levels went out of their way to help us in any way they could and really made our stay very pleasant. The location of the hotel is ideal for access to everything. We were within walking distance of Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, several train stations, all the shops including the superb Queen Victoria Building. We stayed in Sydney last year at a very well known hotel in Jamieson street which cost a lot more than the York, but we preferred the apartment in the York and would certainly stay there again.The only problem we encountered was the lifts. There are 3 lifts, while we were staying there one of the lifts was being serviced. On 2 occasions 1 of the other lifts broke down but only for a few hours. However the staff had informed us of the problems with the lift and had apologised in advance. The third lift that was being refurbished was soon to be back in operation.The apartment was well equipped with everything we needed so top marks.Hopefully we will visit Sydney again and we will certainly stay at the York.Bill and Jen SandersonCounty Durham UK
