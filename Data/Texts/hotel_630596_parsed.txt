<Content>Style over substance We stayed in the Hesperia Tower for 3 nights. Not my idea of 5 star luxury. No bath, just a shower. We were promised a city view, but got a motorway view. But worst of all, on our last night we requested an early wake up call for the following morning as we had to catch our plane home, and they failed to do the call. When we came down and complained to the duty manager, he and his reception staff did not seem at all bothered by this critical failure of service. And forget about the spectacular views from the glass dome at the top. Guests are forbidden to enter unless they eat there. So, if you like lots of snazzy mirrors and black granite over good service then this is for you.

<Content>absolutely loved this hotel had an amazing time We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel, and WOW is the opinion!! We updated to the tower club and was so well worth the 60euros per night!! We drunk the best champagne (yes champagne not cava) every night included in the price and when we finished one bottle they opened another. The express breakfast was lovely, a choice of cereals, fruit juices, cold meats, croissants and pastries. You could call in anytime in the day for drinks, coffee and snacks. Also included in the upgrade was membership to the Metro club next door which was a fabulous spa (small tip if you care going you need flip flops and a bathing hat for the pool). The staff at the hotel could not do enough for you and found them to be most helpful and tried very hard to get their english correct. The room was fabulous with a gorgeous view of the city, and the shower was out of this world.Although a few kilometres from town centre it is on the metro line and we got a 3 day ticket at very reasonable cost that enabled us to use the metro and buses to go anywhere in the city. Book this hotel you will not regret it!!!!

<Content>Nice hotel, but way out of town Stayed here for a long weekend in September. Mainly chose this hotel because I got it from Expedia for a great price for a five star hotel.The hotel its self is way out of town, but there is a metro station two minutes away (It is the first stop on the red line, the station is through the large car park across from the main entrance of the hotel). It took 25 minutes to get to the middle of town.The Hotel was very modern and cool. It has a very highly rated and expensive resteraunt called Evo on the pod on top of the building but this was closed during our stay. Given its location it is mainly a business hotel. It was quite close to the airport - cost about 12 Euro. The hotel also runs a shuttle bus to the airport 2 or 3 times a day at specific times - so it is useful if your flight times tie in with the bus schedule - we used it for a late evening flight - it left the hotel at 3pm,All the staff were very good and frendily with the exception of a young woman who was at reception in the evenings who was quite unhelpful.The rooms nice, you come in the main door into the very nice bathroom then there is a further glass door into the bedroom. The bathroom had the best shower ever - very powerful and lots of different jets.

<Content>Hotel with Wow Factor! Best features: Efficient  pleasant concierge and hotel services, efficient Reception staff. The rooms are worthy of a modern 5*. The beds are so comfy - real quality. The view from the 18th floor is stunning (not so great when on the ground). The lift system is the best yet! There is a Shuttle bus service to main tourist area. Jordi Vincente - the restaurant and Bar Manager was very helpful - thank you. Worst Features: No shuttle bus service from the main tourist area. Little bit out of the way when on a short visit to Barcelona. It takes a couple of days to realize that the metro is so near and so easy. The breakfast, although good quality food and of reasonable variety - there were no bowls for cereal, no plates for hot food, no side plates and this was when there were only 6 people in the restaurant. I complained to the management and the next day the manager and all the waiting staff were on their toes - determined to please. However, at 22 euros per person it was not my favourite part of the day. Worth noting the swimming pool is not included and a fee of around 12 euros per person per visit is charged.To sum up: I got a great deal on the stay and it was generally a lovely hotel so yes, I would stay again and if the breakfast service had been better I would have given it a 5.

<Content>Great hotel fantastic service Just back from a romantic weekend in Barcelona stayed at the Hesperia tower. We upgraded to the tower club. Fantastic great value for money. Beautiful room with fantastic views. Not pretty as it is in a built up residential area lots of tower blocks but dramatic. Service impeccable. I told the reservations when upgrading it was my husbands birthday they left us a lovely welcome letter with birthday greetings. Roses on the bed at night chilled cava with strawbwrries and chocolate sauce!!!!! could you ask for more The sixty pound up grade included a lovely buffet breakfast in a fantastic lounge tapas and champagne or whatever you wanted to drink at seven untill eleven. So you could pop in for a nignt cap on return .The excellent metro is accross the road so ultra convieient. This is a great hotel.I left my coat behind and they are posting it as we speak no problem. The modern decor is amazing. Enjoy.

<Content>Wonderful Staff and an amazing hotel We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and cannot emphasise how amazing it is. Yes it is a little way from the city but the courtesy bus is so frequent and on time. We took our nephew with us who lives in Canada and we booked a suite with access to the Tower Club. WE arrived in Barcelona with no luggage - thanks to BMI BABY. The hotel arranged extra toiletries as ours had been lost with the luggage - they then led us to the lounge where a large glass of champagne was poured. They were so sympathetic to our situation even though in this beautiful hotel we only had the clothes in which we stood. Having stayed in many fine hotels around the world this one ranks up there as one of the best. The whole ambience you cannot appreciate until you are there. We were on the 19th floor and my nephew was able to spot all the major landmarks from his window. Breakfast was made to order and the Tapas range in the evenings spectacular. Although my Canadian nephew had not had Tapas before - they brought him plate after plate - and were so sweet. The hotel is a joy, the staff are some of the nicest I have ever experienced throughut my travels. Please do not hesitate to book this hotel - you will not be sorry

<Content>Excellent Hotel Ok so it is out of the city but that was quite nice. Yes it is a business hotel but it has great rooms, fantastic restaurants and the staff were very attentive.The metro stop is just outside and the journey is 15 mins and taxis were only 7 euros.I do agree it is in a very strange neighbourhood.There is a supermarket nearby Visit the restaurants at Port Olympic. You have to do the bus tours but it does take two days. Visit the spanish village on the blue route it is worth it for the restaurants.

<Content>Design over function As other reviewers have stated, this is more of a business than a holiday hotel. 10 minutes from airport. Not a place you would want to stroll around outside, as surrounding area is not very nice. For a holiday I would not recommend it, most definitely. For business, or a conference, yes. Design seems to take precedence over functionality. For example the lobby bar seats look great, but try sitting in some of them....The washrooms on the ground floor look great, but no-one had taken into account that women might want to put their handbag or make up bag down somewhere. And the lifts were in a class of their own, they drove me crazy for the whole time. You cannot just get in a lift, you must state on an LCD which floor you want to get out at and you get assigned a lift. OK, but when there is a queue of people it can get chaotic. And sometimes it gets more complicated as you also have to swipe your room card and then choose the floor. As the lifts were packed one day and I wanted to get to the 4th floor I tried the stairs. Only to find that they only go as far as the 2nd floor and had to get the lift...The rooms were very nicely designed, slightly different than the bog standard business hotel. No kettle or iron. And the 3rd floor bar is beautifully designed and quite comfy.Bar prices quite steep, but a tip is to order a bottle of wine at the bar, approx 鈧?2 which is reasonable.Food good, no complaints there.Don't get me wrong, despite my criticisms above, it is a very nice hotel to stay at, but I would not choose it as a tourist to Barcelona.

<Content>Not a vacation hotel This is a conference/business hotel about 25 minutes metro ride from Barcelona city centre. It is not a holiday hotel. The area is not pleasant with hardly any shops or restaurants. The hotel looks completely out of place in a relatively run down area. Everything about the hotel is modern and cutting edge state of the art. Whilst everything about our room was comfortable the overall hotel experience was sharp rather than holiday relaxing. Breakfast was OK but our scrambled eggs on the first day were horrible and we could not eat them and did not try eggs again. The one dinner we had was 5 star expensive and lousy. On one day there was no hot water at shower time in the morning. This in a virtually empty 5 star hotel. A small bus shuttles between the airport and into town. However on the Saturday that we left there were very few shuttle buses and we had to resort to taking a taxi. The shuttle bus goes into the city but does not return. So unless you take a taxi it can be a little unnerving using the metro late at night. Taxi - 2 staff involved - one to wheel our small cases and the second to put them into the taxi and of course both were tipped for little or no effort or work. However all the staff who served us were very helpful and polite. We chose this hotel because it had a special offer - 5 star hotel for 4 star money and even then it was nearly empty. For a holiday in Barcelona I would not recommend this hotel. Barcelona itself is well worth a long weekend with stunning architecture.

<Content>stunning modern architecture We loved this building. Go to Madrid to see outstanding building design in Terminal 4 of the airport. Go to Barcelons to experience the pure pleasure of state of the art design, luxury quality materials and exciting spaces in Hesperia Tower. This is a must for anyone who loves architecture and enjoys new thinking on making buildings. We went Barcelona to see Gaudi buildings - quirky, packed with visitors even in raining weekday January. Opposite end of the design continuum is the Rogers and co Hesperia Tower, with some echoes of the Modernist Mies van der Rohe Pavilion in the Exposition Park.Hesperia Tower is a tube ride from central Barcelona, but the panoramic views, the sheer enjoyment of the black marble, stainless steel and 'inside out' design reminiscent of the Pompidou Centre is so worth the out of town location. We're going to Barcelona again, to see it in sunshine and to stay in this hotel again, Best breakfast I have ever had and the most delicious evening meals we had in Spain!

<Content>Beautiful hotel, let down by a few niggles We stayed in the Hesperia Tower for a short break in Barcelona in 2007, and overall would recommend it as a luxurious hotel which hits most of the 5* points. We wouldn't worry about the location, while it is not city centre, the metro is reliable and cheap and runs until late so this did not pose any problems. This certainly did not impact on our stay, in fact it was nice to escape the hustle and bustle at the end of the evening.With regard to the hotel, everything is immaculately put together in terms of the way things look, but unfortunately there are a few things that let it down.Firstly, the lifts are a nightmare at busy times. They operate on a swipe card system so when everybody swipes their cards to go/come back from breakfast they go mad and you are left waiting for one for ages, then it stops at all the floors! We resorted to climbing 21 flights of stairs back to our room as we couldn't get a lift! We felt a bit peeved at having to do this in a 5* hotel.Secondly, we felt that the spa had been overadvertised. Although we were aware that there was an additional charge for the spa which some people have complained about, there is basically one pool, one turkish bath bit with some jets in and the obligitary sauna and steam room. It is no different to the Next Generation health club round the corner from our house. If you are looking for a proper spa hotel you will be disappointed. While we were there there was a big conference going on, and the breakfast restaurant was closed, presumably being used for delegates. Normal hotel guests had to eat at large tables of 10 in the conference suite a bit like a wedding, and the food was not refrigerated so was starting to sweat a bit! When you are paying a premium for the food, this is not really satisfactory.Generally we couldn't fault the rooms and the views over Barcelona, but there were a few little things that would be so easily corrected that made a fairly big difference to our perception of the hotel. It's definitely set up for the business traveller, which may be worth considering before booking.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel We stayed at the Hesperia Tower over New Years 2007/2008.Absolutely beautiful hotel, rooms felt very posh, lots of mirrors and fancy lighting.Hotel restaurants are quite expensive - burger and chips for two cost 鈧?0! But we have to say it was the best burger of all time!!!Location is very odd, set in a residential area there is not anything around to do or see. We did venture to the residential area on our first night in search of food and discovered a few little shops - all closed - hence the 鈧?0 burgers.Petrol station to the left of the hotel is handy for sweets, juice, water and nibbles - open 24 hoursBreakfast was expensive so we ventured to the residential shops and in daylight found a patisserrie, fantastic giant chocolate croissants 鈧?.10 each. Lack of tea making facilities had me on a Starbucks hunt , but had to wait until we got into town to find one.Metro station is right on the doorstep so it was really easy to get into town. T10 ticket for 鈧?.90 was fab and you can use it between a few people. Metro runs all night.Hotel room made you feel special as soon as you walk through the door. Glass lifts and glass floor with japenese garden underneath are fantastic. Fabulous views of Barcelona from the floor to ceiling windows. Great hotel away from the hustle and bustle with the comfiest beds ever.Highly recommended.

<Content>Really good time at the Tower We wondered what the catch was when we booked a 5* in Barcelona for considerably less than a chain hotel back in Brum however we pleased to say there wasn't one.My wife and I concur with all the positives that have been mentioned in other reviews. Amazing architecture in the lobby, courteous staff, extraordinary comfy beds and a brilliant shower. One thing I would say to other normal folks like ourselves who consider stopping in the Tower is to remember that it is 5 star Therefore everything that isn't included is very expensive. Breakfast at 28 euros and 拢拢拢 mini bar means that unless you are very rich you need to eat and drink elsewhere. The problem with this is the Tower is nowhere near any other amenities. Not a great problem as the city is quite close but if you need a soft drink you need to make sure you buy one at the metro station or in the city before getting back.I am a man of simple means so the following did not bother me at all, but if you were the sort who frequents a lot of 5* hotels I think there were some small issues that would have pushed you into thinking this was only a 4.1) There is a glass everywhere (which makes the hotel so iconic) However one major flaw with this is that it gets dirty! Our ceiling to floor window was very unclean, as was the lift glass2) I ordered a bottle of wine by e-mail prior to my arrival and it wasn't in our room.3) No gym/pool included in price4) No coffee making facilities (take a kettle)5) A chip in the mirror of the vanity unit.6) They didn't leave a choccy on the bed after our very last turn down service! Disgraceful.Don't get me wrong, Hesperia is a great place, we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. In all honesty we spent very little of it in the room because there is so much to see and do in Barcelona it would be a travesty to spend it stuck in the confines of your hotel.One last point don't let the location put you off stopping here. The metro is very close by and most of the time it is extremely efficient (one every 5 minutes). The metro is a good way of getting around the city as is the tourist bus which runs from the centre of Barcelona.

<Content>Five star hotel for sure... I won a gift certificate for one night at this lovely hotel on eBay which I used for my last night of a month-long European Tour and was rewarded with a stay far above my wildest expectations!I had a Tower Club room, which meant I had access to a special club with a full bar and a buffet of wonderful tapas all day. This also included free access to their spa which I didn't use, and why would I? The room had the greatest bathroom I've ever seen in a Hotel (and I've stayed in a number of 5-star hotels).The bed and furnishings were excellent, the staff exceptional and the food at both the Club Room and in the restaurant was outstanding (if slightly overpriced- even for a 5-star hotel).It is really outside the cuty but very close to the airport and Metro. However, since the Metro closes at midnight, my guess is staying here for a Barcelona extended stay would rack up the Taxi charges.But overall, a very fine hotel!

<Content>An Architect/Designers Dream Hotel. We spent two wonderful nights at the Hesperia Tower Hotel en route to our holiday. The design of the hotel inside and out was brilliant and ultra modern, an added bonus for an Architect! The room was very light and had wonderful views of Barcelona. The breakfast was excellent with a wide selection of hot and cold dishes as well as cereals. We also had a very pleasant meal in the bar area when we arrived late in the evening. One problem we had was finding the stop for the Courtesy bus at the airport and had the misfortune of seeing it drive straight past us so had to take a taxi. With regard to the Hotel being out of the City, we found travelling to and from the City was no problem although we found it quicker to get a bus rather than the metro. All the staff were very courteous and extremely efficient and we look forward to returning for a longer stay. We would not hesitate to recommend the hotel.

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous This is a very posh hotel, extremely well done, v courteous staff and fabulous rooms. The bathroom had the best shower I have ever been in and all bvlgari toiletries. Yes it does have a rather funny location but its only 2 minute walk to the subway and a straight train from there goes to the center of town (total journey time is 20 minutes). The breakfast is quite pricey but absolutely gorgeous spread - full english breakfast plus mounds of excellent cheeses, nuts, salads and cold cuts with all kinds of fresh juices, so well worth it. Only drawback, for a five star, this hotel doesnt have a pool or a gym. They do have an agreement with a fitness center behind the property, but charge guests 12 euros for its use? I thought this was a basic feature of a five star. Didnt bother us too much as we spent our time out in the city.Overall, we would definitely go back.

<Content>Remote but luxurious Wonderful hotel for a conference. I stayed there for a banking conference in February and am finally getting around to writing a review. Staff is great, property is lovely and luxurious. However, it is a long train ride to downtown, probably about 30 minutes. You are close to the hard to find station. If you can get a great price and don't mind a bit of a trip to go downtown each time, this would be an excellent choice. Barcelona is a great city.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Value (on a weekend), Bit Far Out! We found this hotel to be great value for money on a weekend and it is a true 5 star experience. The rooms are modern, very comfy and very stylish indeed. Breakfast is an expensive extra, so we choose to head into Barcelona on a morning and eat breakfast there, so can not comment on food. The only problem is location... it is very near the aiport and has a very regular free shuttle bus service (contact the hotel direct prior to departure for details) but it is quite a way outside of central Barcelona. That said the metro station is just across the street, is great value, runs from 5am till 2am each day and it only takes 20 to 25 mins to get to most central tourist spots. You will pay twice as much (on a weekend) for a central hotel which is only half as good! If you don't mind the metro and want a 5 star hotel that is a bargain... stay here!

<Content>Best hotel I ve ever stayed in I am not a connaisseur of hotels at all but have stayed in quite a few and i thought this place was excellent. Me and my boyfriend loved the deluxe room, with a great shower, views over Barcelona, plasma t.v and automatic curtains. The room service was great, with robes and slippers left by our bed every night. The staff are extremly helpful. the breakfast was pricey at about 拢15 each per day but it was totally worth it as there was a great array on offer and it filled us up till dinner time so no need for money on lunch. (just an ice cream or snack) It was aggreed that the location was not the best , but this did not matter the metro was so cheap and easy to use and its only about 20 mins from the centre. It was actually nice to get away from the busy streets and retire at this great hotel, not without a drink at thier very plush bar first!

The restaurant on the roof is excellent and well worth a visit.Only set back is that it is 25 mins cab drive from the centre and there is nothing to see in the immediate area.

<Content>good hotel, not so good location hesperia tower is a 5 star hotel in a 100mr high tower.all very modern and stylish, you can see that it must have been designed by some famous architect . There is a famous restaurant on top of it . I did not eat there but heard enthusiastic comments about food and the spectacular view.The hotel has some odd features like elevators that one controls from touchscreens placed on each floor. You select your destination and get in, there are actually no push buttons inside the lift. Rooms are spacious and comfortable - as stylish as the rest of the hotel and as odd. The entrance door opens ion a first area all steel and glass where you find lavatories and various glass doors opening respectively on the toilet, on a jacuzzi shower with water massage etc. , a cabinet and also the beautiful room.The only problem of this hotel is that it is not really in barcelona, but more on the outskirts, and it takes 15-20 minutes approx. by cab to get to the city center.

<Content>Great hotel but 30 mins by metro from centre The hotel itself is great, we booked a 'deluxe' room not realising that this meant we would have a huge suite with lounge, dressing room, two toilets (how many hotel rooms have 2 toilets?!), a huge hydro bath tub and a fantastic shower. There was a plasma tv in the lounge and the bedroom. We felt thoroughly spoilt. We were on the 25th floor and the floor to ceiling windows were great. We were a little disappointed with Room Service - it was very slow - 40 minutes for a bottle of cava (and that was after we chased). We used Room Service 4 times and the average wait was 30-40 minutes. The big downside of this hotel is the location. It is very convenient for the metro (literally 3 minutes from the hotel in the car park opposite) but once you're on the metro you are talking a 30 minute (many stops) journey into Plaza Catalunya. There isn't much else around the hotel, just a micro mart next door (a sort of pc world crossed with currys and hmv) but no restaurants or bars. If you're willing to cope with the long journey into the centre then it's a great hotel.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel We stayed at the Hesperia Tower for 4 nights at the beginning of July. It is a wonderful hotel. The architecture is modern and incredible. The rooms and the public rooms are all designed to an exceptionally high modern standard. The staff are all friendly, helpful and professional. The staff knew us by name and they always greeted us and found us taxis etc with the utmost of courtesy. The hotel is far out of the centre of Barcelona, but it is only 10 minutes in a taxi (鈧?5) or 25 minutes on the subway (鈧?.25 single trip). There is also a free shuttle bus service to and from the airport provided by the hotel.We went to the hotel restauarant EVO, on the 27th floor. An absolute experience for anyone into their food. Expensive but worth every penny to experience Santi Santamaria's menu.The rooms in the hotel have electronic blinds, massage shower, towelling robes, slippers, bulgari toiletries, plasma tv, but the only faults I can find is no ironing board or iron or a complimentary coffee and tea facility. These are replaced with the rather expensive laundry service and the room service menu. However, these are minor complaints in the grand scheme of things.An on site spa and gym is available but there is a cost to this. We looked around and it did look spectacular. If I was to offer the management some constructive criticism it would be for them to provide the iron and ironing board, complimentary tea and coffee in the rooms. Let the guests use the pool and gym for nothing ( I am sure they could come up with some corporate deal with the metropolitan spa next door) and also for the shuttle service to take guests into the centre of Barcelona.Providing these extras would make this hotel truley spectacular. We would definately return when we go back to Barcelona.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel, Strange Location My wife and I stayed for long weekend at the Hesperia Tower.We had a room on the 9th floor with far-reaching views. The hotel is new so the rooms are very modern with everything you would expect including a great walk-in massage shower. The linen and pillows were wonderful and the mini-bar fully stocked - Also had nice quiet air-con.The piped music between your room and the lift could do with being lost however.All the staff were very attentive and friendly.The hotel is about half way between the airport and the city centre just off a dual carriageway and beside a large hospital. Strange location.I suspect they are waiting on the corporate crowd to find the venue for conferences etc.... It was a bit rich to call the hotel 5 star when we were there as It was evident some of the facilities are still being built (including the rooftop restaurant)Cabs cost between 15 and 20 euros and take 20-30 mins to the City Centre.If you walk out the hotel and across the hospital car park there is a metro station - We bought 6 trips for less than 5 euros and the train was quicker to get to town.As we got a great last minute deal I cannot grumble as we were paying less than average for an above average hotel - albeit halfway out of town.Would definetley consider a re-visit - certainly if I was arranging a conference for work.

<Content>Lovely hotel in a curious location We had a very comfortable 3 night stay here and I recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a bargain.Opening rates start around 拢120 excluding breakfast. Our spacious room on the 7th floor was full of light from the huge ceiling to floor window. Curtains were operated by a switch of a button.We had a very comfortable bed dressed in fine linens and all the trimmings you'd expect from a 5* hotel.Our room was wonderfully quiet. The colour scheme was a neutral palette with plum, lime and orange accents, all very tasteful and relaxing,with dark wood furniture and much emphasis on texture and shapes. The bathroom featured a dressing area,wardrobe and safe as well as 2 wash hand basins,a superb massage shower,excellent lighting, bath robes and an abundance of towels, hot water and toiletry products.This unusual open plan design had been carefully thought out and we think it was very successful although the vast amount of mirrors can trick the eye. Breakfast was served in the newly opened  Bouquet restauarant at a cost of about 22 euros each plus tax.The best way to describe it is as bountiful with everything fresh and of the highest quality. I particuarly liked the fresh fruits that were available each morning, including, lychees, peaches, strawberries, blackberries, oranges, 3 types of mango and pineapple.The pastries and cooked dishes were also excellent and for those who desire it cava is served as well as fruit juices.Also available were breads,yoghurts, cooked meats, dried fruits and nuts,cheeses and a special diet for those who required it.It was very good value for money but we sometimes found the choice of background music rather less than relaxing.The down side of this hotel is it's location which is best described as unattractive and curious and a long way from the centre of Barcelona.Taxis costs between 10 and 17 euros with a typical journey time of 20 -25 minutes.It sits next to a new large hospital development, opposite the old hospital,in a sort of traffic island close to a municipal housing development. I am at a loss to understand why it was built here but I have asked several questions of the management so I will add on the answers at a later point. Taxi drivers didn't know where we were staying and it became quite a trial getting home. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle bus to and from the airport, about 15 mins away. I am going to suggest that leisure guests need a shuttle bus into town too.It appears that this area is under development,the hotel publicity says in the newly developed business area so maybe in time that is what it will become. It does market itself primarily as a business hotel with an adjoining conference centre and spa due to open in the summer.Staff were wonderful and falling over themselves to look after us as there were very few guests in residence.
