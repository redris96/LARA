<Content>Griya Santrian is a must for any discerning World traveller Confirmation that this hotel is everything that you read in the reviews. The people are very friendly, and really cannot do enough to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as you could wish for.We got a room upgrade when we arrived, and can recommend the Beach Wing rooms. less than 50mts to the pool, another 30mts to the Beach. how lazy do you want to be? oh all right then... the Massage bay with five girls to pamper you is between the rooms and the pool... (The brochure photos of Pool and Beach do not really do the hotel Justice. They are much better when you see them in front of you. The Hotel is also constantly updating and improving facilities, Rooms etc. I am told this by Aussies who were there also, and who go back every year.For Breakfast, I would recommend skipping out to the Mona Lisa restaurant over the road from the entrance. This place is one of the best for food in the resort. The Picadilly Pub is not given a name to do justice to its food and the sporadic entertainments they also put on. Everything is so far above what you expect. Forget the 'Pub' tag, because that is not what it is all about.Taxi and driver can be at your beck and call for the day at a price of less that 拢20 including fuel. (negotiate hard, then add a tip. They like that.Be warned... it is hot in the tropics close to the equator, so don't plan too much jogging and aerobics... The bars will assist you in raising your glass full of Bintang Beer (very good) but if you have a taste for (say) Gin, you will need to go to the hotel Tandjung Sari (go to beach, Turn left, walk about 50mts.(you will soon get the hang of this).I also recommend you take a Jukung boat (Outriggers style Canoe) to the reefs. You probably won't see many fish etc, but the experience and cool breeze is worth it. The boatman will also tell you loads about Bali.Girls... Get you nails done etc by Mary. she is easy to find...go to beach, Turn right, walk about 20mts (you got it yet?). absolutely everything is where you want to find it.Trip into Kuta if you must, but you could do more interesting things with your time...(Another Bintang). Iced Capuccino is pretty good at the Griya Santrian too. They will even bring them to you on the beach.Food is great just about everywhere in Sanur. Cannot really put you off trying just about anywhere to eat. Try the Nasi Goreng, Mie Goreng, and Tom Yang Goom soup, Try Black Rice Pudding and Fried Ice Cream, and you just have to have at least one Arak...Neat.Trips out.... Go by Taxi yourself...You will see more, do more, and return in fair state.Bali Bird Park is very interesting. Pricey maybe, but when you get in there you understand why... can't say more, or I would spoil it for you. There are Komodo Dragons (you will find them...) and there are Geckos absolutely everywhere. Be also aware that Bugs in the tropics are a little bit bigger than those here.....Oh all right.... They are HUGE... but don't worry, you will be fine.Tanah Lot looks impressive, and so does the Sea there, but the memories are of Fruit Bats and enormous Snakes basking in the sun with their Keeper...(next meal perhaps?)Seriously, If Bali is on your 'Must Do' list (and it should be) then the World's number two most popular Island will be a definite high point of your life.Don't expect alcoholic stupours, Kids everywhere screaming, or a rushed, noisy place full of Hi-Tech gadgetry shops, because it is not the costa brava.Go to Bali with an open mind expecting to be pleasantly surprised that EVERYTHING you want in a holiday is there.Start by booking the Griya Santrian as your base, and then come back and confirm that all I have written is the truth.Enjoy, and here's to the next tick on my list.

<Content>Perfect choise My husband and I spent two weeks in Bali during March/April this year. We decided to book a hotel for the first night only as we wanted to find accommodation for the rest of our holiday as we go. We booked the Griya Santrian for our first night in Bali as it is close to the airport in Denpasar. The hotel was great. Perfectly located on the beach. Clean. Really friendly and helpful staff. Good food and a choise of 3 different restaurants as well as a pool bar. We ended up staying for 3 nights spending quality time on the beach and by the pool bar drinking cocktails. Sanur is also a brilliant town. Nice shops and good bars. We really enjoyed our stay at the Griya Santrian and Sanur and will definitely go back if we ever get the chance to go back to Bali - which I hope is very soon.

<Content>Great location Griya Santrian a beautiful resort with a very well kept garden and a lot of old statues in the garden. Also very nice to see at night with all the lights. Breakfast was OK. We ate once in the restaurant which was OK as well. We also joined the BBQ on the beach. Special location and good food (Lobster, King Prawns (you pay for the weight), Chicken Kebab IDR 45.500, Sirloin Steak IDR 59.500). We had lunch at the Wantilan restaurant (main restaurant)or at the Italian restaurant, both with view to the beach. Club Sandwich 32.000, Cheese burger (and a good one!) 41.000, small beer 14.000, Pizza 44.500, mix fruit juices 13.500 and they were to die for!Laundry service was also available (t-shirt 7.500, shirt 10.500, trousers 12.000).We had a very large suite with a nice bathroom and dressing area. It was a pity that it was only one room away from the renovation works so there was a lot of noise from 08.30 AM till 05.30 PM. The works will be finished by now as the manager told us. There will be a new swimmingpool and some 25 rooms are renovated. We were only very disappointed about the reception staff. We never met unfriendly people during our vacation only at the reception of Griya Santrian. They did'n't give you that special feeling that we had in all other hotels on this trip. Cable internet should have been possible in the room (telephone connection)but it didn't work in our room and nobody could (or wanted!)clearly explain how it works so we went to a internet cafe which was nearby. Sanur is a quiet and cosy place. There are lot of shops and the path on the beach side is really great! You can have a nice stroll, passing shops, restaurants and a little market. Griya Santrian is just in the middle of the place.We had diner twice at Ming which was so great! Our last night at Bali we had a fabulous diner. The owner and his daughter were so kind, they recognized us after being there once! It isn't cheap but worth every Rupiah! We also ate at Charming . It's owned bij the same family but a different interior and menu. We loved it here as well!(. They bring you back to the hotel for free.

This hotel is excellent, we have travelled all over the world and this is one of the best, cannot fault it. Rooms and pools lovely. Clean, helpful staff, nothing is too much trouble. Good selection at breakfast. Wonderful massages, pretty flowers, water features everywhere, inscence make for a wonderful atmosphere,I have no trouble in recommending this island or hotel.

<Content>Avoid room 144 or any other connected room to 145 Pools excellent, standard room very dated but currently undergoing a refurbishment, swim up bar and staff excellent, beach very good, but my only complaint was the management not investigating my issue with client in room 145.We arrived and on the first night could hear noise thought it was a local bar, then we realised it was the Guest in room 145 (european) playing loud house music until 04:00 hrs every morning i have a 9 yr old daughter who was woken every night by music and singing.This client actually works in bali (possible timeshare) and often return to his room at midnight then the noise starts the hotel failed to act on my complaint and so it was 14 nts of HELL.Please,Please,Please ensure you avoid these rooms because he has no respect for any other guests allocated rooms next to him.Unless you fancy the Kuta style nightlife please check room number at reception on arrival.

<Content>Home away from Home or Paradise My wife and I have been returning to the same hotel now for at least the past 6 years. We return for the same reasons, year after year.1. The Staff are continually trying to make your stay one that you will always remember.Bar staff excellent, wait staff excellent, house staff look after you like a king,excellent, front office staff always a smile and will do anything for you excellent. During our stays we have been to functions, wined and dined and also had pizzas and snacks, the meals are second to none, the hotel has a great head chef and very good team of chefs. This is why the hotel has a high occupancy, the staff and facillities are like a magnet, they keep on dragging you back to paradise. See you in 2008. David  Kerry Rose Australia.

<Content>A good value family run hotel Stayed at the Griya Santrian for a couple of weeks in late April/May 2008. Stayed in a modern block by the garden pool. A great quiet room. Had a lovely tranquil stay, the food was of good quality and value, especially the beach bbq on the Monday night. The staff were friendly and attended to our needs, the towel system worked fine for us. A couple of minor gripes, the taxi guy at reception is not worth using as the charges he quotes are way over the mark. People have obviously complained about small lizards in their room (they are very useful mosquito eating animals and would do no harm to humans) and so the hotel has resorted to spraying the garden each Friday evening to get rid of the bugs, which is a shame. But these were small matters on an otherwise fabulous time at the hotel and for what we paid for, a real bargin.

<Content>sydandfiona England ok but On arrival very friendly and helpful staff--the gardens were well kept and tidy--easy walk to the beach also well kept and tidy--the food in the restaurant was excellent.The room a deluxe was ok and cleaned daily to a good standard (by Ratu) but you could always find strange little creatures scampering about (not his fault just plenty of them in that part of the world)Now the downside--a/c not really good enough--a disco banging away on the main street outside the comlex till the early hours--strange smells from the toilet and when we left after two weeks nobody on the desk said goodbye--the bell-boy didn,t turn up so we dragged the cases down ourselves -no big deal but it would have been a nice touch if somebody on the front desk had made the effort----in all a good holiday just slightly spoilt at the end

<Content>Not Impressed 3 of us shared a beach wing room at griya Santrian last week. Our travel agent recommended it as it had newly built beach wing rooms that she had had good reports on.On arrival we were put into a very old room. It was very large, but the aircon was not strong enough for the room. When asked about the new rooms, we were told they were already full and that my request had been only for beach wing and that the new beach wing rooms were deluxe (surely travel agent for New Horizons should have known that, and I'm pretty sure I paid for the new beach wing!)First morning we got towels for pool and had a swim and sunbathed. Handed back towels to get towel coupon back, then went for shopping. A few hours later we went back to hotel to have a swim. Firstly the pool had run out of towels (this was only 5pm) and when we complained were told we had already had a towel that day and should not have another. Was not impressed and won't be back.

<Content>One of the best We've just returned from a 4 week holiday in this hotel and enjoyed all aspects of our stay immensely. We paid a little extra for a de-luxe room which was delightful and also looked at 2 different ordinary rooms which were also very good. The hotel has a superb position, is maintained to a very high standard and the staff are almost universally smiley and helpful.The only reason that we have not rated it excellent is the lack of any smoke-free area in the restaurant. With chain-smoking guests at all meals (including breakfast) this was something of a problem. However, we mentioned this small glitch to the splendid hotel manager before leaving, so, hopefully, some remedial action will be taken.We would readily return for aother holiday at the Griya Santria and it says much for its quality that many people we met do go back year after year.John and Jill Feb 2008.

<Content>Too noisy Stayed here Dec 06/Jan 07 with a friend who had stayed at Griya 3 years ago. She had no problems on her first stay but was shocked to find how noisy it has become. Very loud music from bars out in the street until 4.00am! We asked to move to another room after 2 nights. If you stay here make sure you get a room beachfront as much too noisy down the back of the complex. Didn't find the staff overly helpful when we asked to be moved as we had to ask a couple of times. We still ended up with a room that was only marginally better.Staff are certainly aware of the noise issue and and we found out also that other guests had similar complaints. The Griya isn't cheap accommodation and I expect better frankly.

<Content>Heading Back For More On our first stay here, I was surprised at the quality of accommodation for the price. For under $200 a night, we stayed at the Santrian Suite for a week! Glad we did as we spent quite a lot of time indoors (the humidity in November was quite high). The suite is spacious with a contemporary design. There were separate dressing area and a large bath suite with glass enclosed shower and deep tub.The front desk manager is the real gem of this property. Everything we wanted, he arranged for us - yoga in the morning, a shopping trip in town, fishing, tours, and a special menu. Agreed with previous review that the place does attract a more senior, and more laid back client猫le. The restaurant by the beach has a very limited menu which is another drawback, but their service is prompt and friendly. With the traditional Balinese features, a large beachside pool with a sunken bar, and it's own stretch of beach, this has got to be one of the best holiday deals! Going back for more in February!

<Content>An absolute gem This is a small hotel, about 100 rooms,set in tropical gardens, right on the beach in Sanur,and within three minutes walk of the main street with numerous restuarants and shops.  The hotel is well maintained and the staff are friendly and helplful, we stayed in the garden wing in a fairly basic room,it had no TV or tea/coffee makin facilities, but was spotlessly clean with a very efficient air conditioner, the balcony looked out over the beautiful gardens, with a pond and fountains, sitting there in the evening with a cool drink was a much better way of spending time than watching some drivel on the TV. There is a renovation programme underway, by next spring all the rooms will have been upgraded internally, but will kep their character externally. There are two swimming pools , the beach pool is adjacent to the beach promenade, and has a swim up bar, the garden pool is smaller though has a wonderful setting, surrounded by flowering shrubs and trees ,an has a separate jacuzzi.  The restaurant is near the beach pool, and offers views over the sea, breakfast is a buffet with eggs  omlettes cooked to order ( do not prebook BB, we were quoted 拢7 per person per day by the tour company, it's about 拢3 bought directly from the hotel). Food is of a very good standard and very inexpensive by UK standards, the Sea Food Barbecue, held on the beach is excellent. I have stayed in many hotels both much larger and much more expensive the the Griya Santrian, though few if any have made such an impression, I tend not to return to hotel I have previously visited, though I will make an exception in this case, it's an absolute gem.

<Content>tranqulity at the griya after checking out the internet for different hotels in the sanur beach area which is where we wanted to stay after staying at sanur on previous trips and seeing how beautiful and tranquil it is walking along the path at beach front to most of the hotels in sanur, months prior to booking our bali trip this year griya santrian would have to been one of my better choices of places to stay in bali after visiting the island for the 8th time and each time staying at different areas! I had contacted griya direct after booking the trip through our travel agent which had alreadygiven us a good price for staying in the beach wing room and asked their customer service people to try and put my son andhe's friend both 16yrs old sharing a twin room either next to our room or close by!! Kadek from griya's customer service had come back to me saying he had up-graded us to the deluxe rooms which were next to each other and what beautiful rooms they were... They were right next to the pool and beach, and sitting on the verandah of a morning was so pleasant and peaceful, just looking out over griya's beautiful and immaculate gardens and everyone walking past would always say good morning no matter what nationallity. My husband and I would go for a quiet swim around 9pm and stay in the pool for over 1hr just to hear the musicians playing and to gather our thoughts, because that is how peaceful it is and you can do that at griya! We all loved every thing about Griya from the staff, the area and the place itself, I cannot say enough about it, definatley will be returning and will tell everyone we know that is interested in travelling to bali about griya santrian and the tranquility feeling you get by just staying there!!

<Content>Wonderufl, relaxing and nearly perfect We arrived at this hotel after checking out of a hotel at Jimbaran. Sanur is a perfect location and Griya Santrian is even better. Centrally located with beautiful pools and peaceful gardens. Breakfast is offered in their beachfront resturant which makes for a great way to start your day. We stayed in the deluxe rooms which were contemporary, spacious and relaxing. We had our 3 school aged children with us on this trip. They too enjoyed the ambience. We were completely comfortable with our children exploring the beachfront promenade without us during the day and equally comfortable at night where we discovered different restaurants each night without the swarm of honking cars and bikes. There is plenty to do and see or not do anything at all.

<Content>Lovely Holiday Just Home from fabulous Bali. The Griya is a great hotel so relaxing in a beautiful location. On arrival we upgraded our room and stayed in the new deluxe rooms- fantastic, modern, huge wet room, sofa on the balcony well worth the bit extra money. These new rooms have replaced the thatched roof cottages featured on most websites. Breakfast is nice eggs cooked to your preference, breads, fruit, quite a good selection. Eating it whilst looking at the sea makes it perfect. Lovely pool with a swim up bar and friendly service and a private section of the beach. We hired a driver, Dewa, from the hotel, (parks just out the front) and went to Jimboran for a fab seafood dinner sat right on the beach watching the sun set. He also took us to Dreamlands an amazing surfers beach about 50 mins away and into Kuta for a night out. Definatly hire a driver, they can take you where ever you want to go on the island, wait for you and bring you back to the hotel and are much much cheeper than booking over crowded trips via your holiday rep. Good restaurants in Sanur we visited were Piccadilly, front of the hotel turn right about 5 mins down the road, Village front of the hotel on the right and Pergola which is about a 15 min walk on the right. There are some nice restaurants along the beach front too. Nightlife in Sanur doesnt really exist although there are some bars that do open till late. Go for a drink or a meal at Mangos, left along the beach front from the hotel, the staff there are so friendly ask them anything about sanur where to go, shopping etc and they are full of helpful info. If your after a tattoo ask them about PJ an amazingly talented artist!Great hotel great place will go back ourselves and highly recommend it.

<Content>a few things Disappointment on arrival as our room upgrades were not available. We had booked two rooms and had to wait 3 days for one room to be upgraded and 5 days for the other room., we were only there for 10 days. Not good enough when you have booked better rooms. We were separated from our children and although the gardens of this hotel are fabulous it quite a distance from one room to another. Many older guests that go every year they all seem to know each other. The hotel itself is ok if you can get better rooms make sure you do it, standard rooms not brilliant. Pool area ok. Breakfast dissapointing. Beach lovely. Alot of building work going on although noise is minimal. Would not stay again.

<Content>Bali Highlights and Tips from a Recent Trip Bali Highlights and Tips from a Recent TripAgency to book with: Escapes Unlimited!! We were delighted working with Jane at Escapes Unlimited (www.escapesltd.com). She gave us choices for accommodations, answered numerous questions and gave us much good information. She made all arrangements for our flights, stopovers, accommodations and some guide services.Airline: Singapore Airlines is great! From the warm, moist towels given to each passenger on arrival, to the free beverages (including wine), to the menu choices, to the excellent service, to the myriad movie and other video and audio entertainment choices, to punctuality, everything was splendid! On the long flight home, we had requested exit seats and were fortunate to get the exit row that only allows two of the three seat sections to be booked, so we had plenty of room and even slept well!Accommodations: Griya Santrian in Sanur is lovely! The lush gardens surrounding the individual bungalows, the two swimming pools, the good restaurant, and, of course, the location right on the beach make this a great choice! Gamelon players at breakfast and live music of various varieties with dinner really added to the experience.Puri Saraswati in Ubud is also lovely! It is located on the former gardens of the palace grounds, right next to the temple to Saraswati (goddess of wisdom). The location is right in the midst of things in Ubud, but because it is set back considerably from the street, we had real sense of security and escape, but a ready access to events at nearby temples and the palace. Only breakfast is served here, but excellent restaurants are abundant nearby. The style here, too, is bungalows, with individual porches, spacious rooms, most pleasant service.Restaurants: In Sanur we only ate at our hotel, and our meals were very good, especially the seafood grill one evening, with candle lit tables set right on the sand.In Ubud: Caf茅 Lotus right next to the hotel looks out over the extensive lotus pond that is in front of the temple to Saraswati. We particularly liked their samosa.Miro鈥檚 Garden (up the street away from the Palace, a bit up and across from the Museum of Fine Art) is a very quiet place, up a flight of outside stairs to rooftop garden setting, with both open and enclosed tables, very nice presentation of food, good lassi and good chicken curry.Lamak Bali on Monkey Forest Road has a very modern atmosphere, unique menu items, and we enjoyed excellent seared scallops among other things. They also provide a nice service of free rides to patrons back to their hotels.Caf茅 Batan Warung, near the football field, is also partially open air, and there we enjoyed more chicken curry and steamed chicken wrapped in banana leaf teepees.Dirty Duck II, which is further out than the one on Monkey Forest Road, is situated literally among the rice fields. We walked along pathways over the rice, past several dining pavilions before reaching the last one, where we were seated, surrounded by greenery! The food was very good, especially the tuna kabob. Shops: Many, many, many! In Sanur, we enjoyed the first saroung and dress shop to the left from Griya Santrian on the wonderful brick walkway that runs along a major stretch of the beach. Also, in the Sanur Beach Market place that is off the walkway, look up Stall #39, where Studio Co-Operate painters Suana and Marco paint and sell their brilliantly colored paintings of Bali scenes (Note: bring som of the paper Marco wrapped our painting in to adhere to the painting when we unwrapped it.). In Ubud, down the main street, adjacent to the Oka Kartini Puppet Stage is the Oka Kartini Gallery, where we found quality puppets, masks and other artwork, and a most informative puppeteer-in-training who assisted us. Also, Threads of Life, down the alley way between Puri Saraswati and the street before the Palace, features all kinds of woven hangings and other work by a women鈥檚 cooperative of weavers from throughout Indonesia.Artists at work: Suana, mentioned above, is fun to watch, as he puts brilliant bits of color on the canvas and creates vivid scenes. Drive a short distance from Ubud to see I Ketut Darsana, puppet carver, at Br. Babakan, Sukawati (Telephone: (0361) 295012); he will demonstrate how he creates magnificent shadow puppets from treated hides, paints them and then demonstrates the various voices and tells the characteristics of major puppets and even will put on a brief shadow puppet show in the front room of his home! We were most impressed with the passion he has for his art! (And he sells his puppets at reasonable rates - approx.US$40.00 for the White Monkey puppet).Guides: I Putu Artama was the guide provided for us by Escapes Unlimited to greet us at the airport, take us to and from our two hotels and provide one day of sight seeing. He was most informative and took us to see our first temple, to a wood carving family and a silversmith. His information helped us understand what we were seeing and to learn much about Bali culture. He and his driver also, with the help of a suggestion in Lonely Planet Guide to Bali and Lombak, found the above puppet maker.Dewa Marco (dewamarco@hotmail.com) is a guide we learned about on Frommer鈥檚 Travel Talk section on Bali. He was most informative, as he transported us in his air conditioned car to lots of good places! We communicated with him before our arrival, asking for his suggestions, making some choices, and then being delighted when he took us to additional, unexpected sights along the way each of our three days together.  Sights: Too numerous to mention! Check out Lonely Planet, talk with other travelers and your guides. Ubud abounds in traditional performances! Also, we want to mention the sunrises at Sanur. Everyone who travels to Bali raves about the sunsets, which are, no doubt lovely. We were never on the Western side of Bali, but we did get up at Sanur at 5:30 a.m. and saw a most beautiful sunrise! General Tips: Pump action bug spray was helpful. A mini-flashlight is also helpful, somewhat on the uneven sidewalks in Ubud at night, but definitely to read the menu at several of the restaurants at night! A lightweight, hooded sweater really helps with the occasionally chilly air on the flights. Be sure to keep your credit card receipts, as in Bali the whole number is printed on the receipt, so fraud is easier if someone finds a receipt in the trash.Peter and Katherine (kmconover@hotmail.com if you have some questions)

<Content>Favourite place in Bali is Sanur We stayed at the Griya Santrian in Sanur and were upgraded to a superior room which far out weighed the normal garden rooms. Our stay was very nice and we loved the walkway along the beach towards the market all the restaurants were on the beach of an evening.We now stay in the Bali Hyatt and the lovely walk is still there for those restaurants.We have seen all there is to see in Bali but we still go back for the relaxation of Sanur. It is a beautiful place. We do go into Kuta now and then for a change of scenery but are always pleased to get back to Sanur

<Content>Wonderful in every way! After a night at a nearby hotel that was less than satisfactory we happened upon the Griya Santrian. Since they were not fully booked and it wasn鈥檛 high season we were able to negotiate a bit with the friendly supervisor who showed us a few rooms. These rates he quoted us were far less than the brochure price. The first and most basic room (superior - $65 including breakfast, tax, and service) we viewed was relatively plain and functional but clean and well maintained. It had a far more lavish exterior than interior, but was still a decent value considering the properties鈥?amenities. The second room (deluxe - $90 including breakfast, tax, and service) was much nicer with a good view, beautiful d茅cor and distinctive Balinese furniture. We agreed to take the second room and went back to reception. As we were registering he looked at his upcoming bookings and asked if we鈥檇 like to see a room that was 鈥渞eally special鈥?for the deeply discounted rate of $100 (including breakfast, tax and service) a night. We agreed and he showed us to a newly remodeled 鈥淕arden Suite鈥?which was at least twice the size of a deluxe room, beautifully decorated with a large canopy bed, had a dressing area and large closets, and was attached to a huge bathroom containing a sizeable bathtub and separate huge glassed-in shower. We quickly agreed and I said 鈥渉appy anniversary鈥?to my wife as we were walking back to the reception (we had been unable to spend our wedding anniversary two weeks prior in a nice locale), and upon hearing this, the supervisor asked if we were celebrating here. We explained that we had been unable to celebrate it a few weeks earlier, he nodded and smiled and we figured it was forgotten. Upon returning to our room after we had visited the pool later that afternoon, two complimentary desserts and a fruit basket along with a happy anniversary card had been delivered! We were touched and surprised!The hotel has a magnificent garden setting, a big stretch of beachfront, two swimming pools and ornately distinctive Balinese architecture and sculpture ornamenting the grounds. Tranquil and beautiful! Service was attentive and the rooms and grounds were immaculate. The buffet breakfast was wonderful with a great variety of food, tons of fresh fruit, an egg station, and a selection of different hot items that changed each day.Overall, the Griya was magnificent for us and we have nothing but good things to say about the staff and property! Amazing service, amenities, and value for the price we paid!

<Content>Beach Scene The Griya Santrian is a nice hotel right on the beach of Sanur. Even though it wasn't peak time in Bali, Griya was packed! So much so that you had to reserve your sun lounge quite early in the morning around the pool and on the beach - oh and watch out for people stealing 2 matteresses for their sunlounge, if you find this just ask the pool attendant. The breakfasts were average, but they did have vegemite!( A rarity in Bali)Its a great location, out the front of the resort is a beautiful restaurant called The Village, absolute fine dining at a great price! The only bad thing about Griya could be that a lot of over 50's go there, being in our young 20's my group found it a little hard sometimes to have fun, but if you are older and looking for a relaxing time with beautiful views you certainly find it at Griya and will most likely make some great friends.

<Content>Loved the Griya! Spent 8 nights at the Griya - and it was perfect for us - two small kids and my mother. The front rooms near the pool are great if you have kids, and the new suites looked very plush and grown-up - so something for everyone. Restaurants and service all great. We looked at a lot of hotels in Sanur while wandering around, and think the Griya was one ofthe best. MANY repeat guests which is a good sign. Sanur was excellent, liked much more than Seminyak/Legian for this trip with kids/grandma.

<Content>griya santrian sanur This gorgeous boutique hotel was a quiet, classy oasis on the shores of the palm fringed sanur beach. I stayed in a cottage next to the garden pool. The decor and architecture were traditional and a little tired however the bed was comfortable and the room overlooked the garden pool which was fabulous. Others in my party stayed in the beautiful newly built suites, contemporary styling, bathrooms and decor. Very lush. The restaurant was newly built: location and menu faultless. Both the seafood BBQ and the in house cooking lesson are amust Do. otherwise grab a cocktail and roll up to one of the two pools or the beach when ready( no need to reserve a lounge). The staff were helpful and courteous extending checkout until 4pm on my final day.
