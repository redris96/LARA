<Content>Winter stay in Florence - perfect location! My boyfriend and I booked this hotel directly from the website after reading reviews online. It offered a reasonable discount for rooms during the winter months and looked very pleasant from the photos.It's more like a BB but very cute and charming. Unfortunately it doesn't have a lift but this wasn't a real problem for us (especially after climbing up the steps of the Duomo! It is situated on a street that is lined with little star lights (I assume this was only for Christmas). It takes about 10-15 mins to walk into the city centre but upon leaving the hotel, you turn right and walk straight ahead and you reach the main square! The breakfast was delicious and we were served a fresh coffee of our choice each morning. We had a problem with our sink not draining and informed the manager at breakfast and it was fixed by the time we arrived back early evening. The television had a decent selection of channels, the bathroom was small but clean and our room was cleaned every day. I felt very safe there and would definitely stay there again the next time I visit Florence.

<Content>Great location, a little pricy Nice rooms, no elevator. Central location, just a five minute walk to downtown Florence. Bring earplugs, as you easily hear noise from corridor.

<Content>Don't do it. We arrived at hotel piccolo to find no parking or assistance with parking in the busy streets of florence  then no lift within the drab little hotel  having to drag our luggage up 3 flights of stairs to find an exceptionally rude person at reception who offered absoloutely no help whatsoever when it came to recommending restaurants or directions. Then to my absoloute horror, the toilet was actually inside the shower there was no barrier between the two  no space to move. The internet connection is terrible  the attendents had no idea of how to work it. Then when we made the decision to leave the hotel in order not to ruin our florence experience they charged us a higher rate at a minumum of 2 nights even though we only stayed on night. I would definitely recommend people NOT to stay here. In my experience having a good hotel base makes the trip much more enjoyable - my partner  I both sacrificed alot more money than we planned to find another hotel  pay the increased rate hotel piccolo decided to charge us at the last minute after telling us originally that they would not charge us a penalty for staying less nights. We ended up staying in Il GUELFO BIANCO which was an exceptional hotel the rooms were huge the service was great - they saved our florence experience. If you want to enjoy Florence DO NOT GO TO HOTEL PICCOLO. I have a photo of the bathroom  will load it on here when I have a chance - a picture speaks a thousand words.

<Content>Good, but not the best We booked a room at this hotel and it was nice and comfortable, with a view into a nice courtyard area. The staff were helpful and the breakfast was nice, even though early so difficult to get up for. The breakfast room was nice and large. The males at the location were much friendlier than the females, even helping us with my friends overweight luggage. Overall it was nice, but we had some really nice stays other places so our expectation level was a bit high. Also, the 2 flights of stairs were a bummer after having only one small flight in Rome.

<Content>Small and charming The Piccolo exceeded our expectations. It was small, charming and we received a very helpful welcome from the staff. Our room on the first floor was clean and simply furnished with two windows that had both external and internal shutters facing a courtyard so one could choose whatever combinastion one wished. The bathroom was large and very clean. The breakfast was basic but certainly more than adequate with rolls, biscuits, drinks, cereals, and yoghurts and good service. The location was excellent with many main attractions like the Duomo within easy walking distance and at San Marco (less than 5 mins) the small town-bus starts and other bus routes are there too. Overall the hotel is efficient, friendly and caring and the proprietor speaks excellent English and can direct you to the attractions of the city, which she obviously loves. At this time of the year - 4 nights in late Feb early March -, the price made it truly excellent value for money. I shall recommend it to others.

<Content>Worst hotel We weren't expecting a luxury hotel for our 3 nights at Piccolo, just a basic, clean hotel with reasonable service, but we didn't get either. The bathroom was not clean at all. The shower curtain was mouldy as were the corners of the shower cubicle. The bathroom had no window and the exhaust fan didn't work, nothing to clear the mouldy smell. We reported the problem with the exhaust fan but nothing was done about it while we were there. Then if we opened either of the two windows in the room, there was a foul smell from outside, probably from a gutter which was just outside the windows and collected rubbish and water.  One good thing about the room was that it was reasonably spacious, but there were always mosquitoes around. On the second morning, I awoke with multiple insect bites on my arms and legs which I think were from mosquitoes.  We also didn't find the staff to be very friendly or helpful whenever we asked questions.  On the first morning, we were the only ones in the breakfast room. There was a breakfast buffet table laid out but no coffee or tea. We waited for a short time before asking at reception if they served coffee or tea with breakfast. The young woman promptly replied No and went back to her work. We thought it was a bit strange as there were coffee/tea cups stacked in the breakfast room but we didn't ask her again. The next morning when we went to the breakfast room, a different woman was at the desk. She promptly followed us into the breakfast room and offered us coffee or tea and brought us a basket of fresh bread and croissants which we also didn't get the previous day. Maybe the other woman had more important things to do than serve us breakfast.  We would never stay here again.

<Content>The Piccolo Hotel, small and friendly.... A friend recommended The Piccolo and indeed it is a small hotel. However, the personnel are accommodating and helpful and the location within walking distance to many attractions. In fact, when my family of five arrived in Firenze we went directly to the Galleria Accademia for the afternoon to see the David and other remarkable art and then walked to the hotel. After checking in, we walked to the leather district, the Duomo, and the Ponte Vecchio. The young woman who greeted us gave us a good recommendation for dinner. Upon returning for the night we met the manager of the hotel, Signora Angeloni who is very nice. Once we were settled in our room she locked up the hotel ... we can only wonder how long she patiently waited for us. The hotel was clean and very reasonable in cost. This was the only hotel during our month long stay that allowed all five of us to share a room (most hotels insisted we take two rooms as we exceeded their maximum of three to a room; a problem as our children are too young to sleep alone in an hotel). The parking was secure, but a little further than I expected. Sgn. A. helped me to select our final destination for our trip.. something we had left open...we were truly pleased with her reccomendation. Overall, we enjoyed our brief stay at The Piccolo with Signora Angeloni.

<Content>Piccolo is Great My mother, daughter and I stayed at the Piccolo in Florence. We wanted a triple room which we had. It was bigger than any other triples in Europe that we had the previous nights. It was very clean and airy. It has air-conditioning that works which we found unique in Italy!.. Silvia and her staff are excellent. We felt like family. Prior to our arrival Silvia had sent me things to do in Florence. Our favaorite was a Tuscan cooking class and second the wine tasting tour. She had all of our tickets on our arrival and mapped everything out for us. The stay includes breakfast with great Americano coffee, pastries, juice, and cereal. It was all we needed until dinner. There also was an excellent restaurant just a couple of doors down from the hotel. We were within walking distance of the Duamo and we were only two blocks from  The David. We certainly enjoyed our stay in Florence.

<Content>highly recommended!!!! What a great suprise; the staff was VERY VERY good and informative; rooms are exactly as described, if not better, and all for the price of just a bit more than a hostel (my partner and I stayed together .... a hostel double would have cost about the same, andwe had + + privacy, quiet and our own washroom). Rooms are very clean and well kept. Our room had a beautiful view out of our doors of a small garden. Hotel is within walking distance form most great attractions, just watch over-charging at the train station .. the hotel is not that far to walk and should not cost over 5鈧?.. our taxi ripped us off, but this had nothing to do with the hotel. The hotel is i a residential area that we found great, as you can be around REAL Florenteens and students, so you get a real taste of life in Florence. Our stay was SO good we stayed an extra night. Well done, Piccolo  thank you!!

<Content>Great location  Overall we were very happy with our experience at the Piccolo. It wasn't luxurious but we were not expecting that for the price. The place was kept up very nice, it was clean and they were extremely helpful  welcoming, what more could you ask for!The location is great and there was an adequate breakfast each morning. We really enjoyed our stay there and would definitely recommend it to others.

<Content>Passionate about the Piccolo Just had 6 dreamy days in beautiful Florence and we stayed in a really lovely hotel: the Piccolo on Via S. Gallo, which is really near the historic centre. I would totally recommend this place to anyone planning a trip to Florence (and if you're not, then plan one now!). It's a charming and comfortable little hotel run by the nicest people, especially the owner who was really helpful with where to go and what to see. It's very close to most of the attractions and it's surrounded by some very good shops, restaurants, bars and (of course) trattorias! We had a great time.

<Content>The Piccolo's Great!!! I can't imagine what the person who wrote that the Piccolo hotel in Florence was hideous can have been thinking about. I've stayed there myself, more than once (last time Feb. this year) and it's lovely, it's clean and comfortable, the rooms are well furnished and the staff friendly and helpful, altogether a positive experience and highly recommendable!!!

<Content>hideous!!!! This place is absolutely horrendous, unkempt, uncomfortable and unwelcoming. I booked into this 'hotel' after reading the other reviews on here but checked out the same evening after managing to obtain a much better hotel for not much more money. I still had to pay for a nights accomodation even though I did not stay, there were no questions asked as to why I was leaving, I would guess this happens a lot. I cannot understand why anyone would stay here of there own free will it is absolutely hideous!

<Content>What a wonderful experience When we visited, it was low season in Florence. Only owner serviced us. She is very kind and extremely helpful(she provide useful advice whenever we have any question about trip). We even changed our travel plan and extended one more night.Room is big and clean. It is only a 10 minute walk to the train station. Besides, rate is reasonable.

<Content>Nice hotel... My family recently stayed at the Piccolo hotel for 3 nights. Our room was very large and clean. While it had nice wood laminate floors, they were very loud. Whenever anyone walked up the stairs or opened/closed their door, our door shook and it was very, very loud - the floors just echoed the noice. Other than that the hotel was great and the staff was very friendly. The location was nice as it was walking distance to nearly everything - even with a 5 year old. For a nice hotel at a reasonable price - pack your earplugs and enjoy!

<Content>Great Place You would never know that hiding behind a little sign and past a dingy hallway with rope lifts would be such a little gem. What character! The Piccolo is small  cozy  full of warmth, hospitality,  charm. From the friendly advice we recieved from emails even before our trip, to the large clean rooms, to the quaint breakfast each am we were so impressed. The staff was very helpful, even when it came to them making numerous phone calls for us when we left our laundry at the cleaners that was not to open again until after we left Florence. (We really should know a little more Italian!) I felt as though we were staying at a distant relative's home instead of a hotel! Have a great stay!

<Content>Perfect The staff at Piccolo were wonderful. They were very kind and extremely helpful (They called ahead to book our reservations at Cinque Terra for us). It is not extremely fancy, but it is clean and a charming place. 24 hour desk serice. Booked our reservation via email and their response was immediate. The location is great and only a few minutes walk to all the sites. It is only a 10 minute walk to the train station but we took a taxi since we had a lot of luggage. We found some of the best food in Italy only a few feet down the street from Piccolo. Price was reasonable and we will stay their again.

<Content>Free bike rides and friendly service. Our stay at the Piccolo was wonderful. The rooms are spacious, clean, and simple. But what makes the hotel a great choice are the little things the hotel offers that most do not. First of all, the hotel is in a great location. It is close to all of the shopping and the Duomo. Second, the hotel offers free bicycle usage to its guests. Florence is great on foot, but having a bicycle while exploring the sights was fantastic. Finally, the service is first rate... the small staff is friendly, outgoing, and personable (and very knowledgeable). The hotel is quite inexpensive, and when you factor in the quality of service and the bicycles, it is a great value! We will stay here again. Highly recommended.

<Content>Good location - small hotel - not bad The Piccolo Hotel is well located about 10 minutes' walk from the Duomo. (Don't bring your car to the hotel - its in the historic centre and you'll get a fine, and anyway there's no parking there).The rooms are clean but very basic with minimal decoration. Air conditioning provided but not that effective. The receptionist was very helpful indeed and you get an OK breakfast.Definitely worth considering for a short stay in Florence.
