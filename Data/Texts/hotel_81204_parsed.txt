<Content>Nice time at Le Meridien SF We had a rather large family grouping visiting San Fran for two days and stayed at Le Meridien. We also had a rather complicated reservation as two rooms were booked one way and another room was booked differently. We arrived at noon (three hours before check-in) and not only did they easily link all the reservations, we were checked in and placed in rooms directly next to each other. It was a refreshingly quick and efficient check-in. I went in all three rooms after check-in to make sure they were the bed types we had requested, and everything was fine. The only thing I noticed was that some rooms are slightly larger than others, but this can be seen in the building maps as the building is larger toward the center, and narrower at the end. Even if getting a smaller room, I would not have thought anything of it. Our room had a slight view of the Bay Bridge, but was nothing spectacular. I did like the floor to ceiling windows and found the (what seemed to be) newly renovated room to be nice. Probably the biggest bonus to this hotel is the location. It's in the middle of all the action: Chinatown, Financial District, Embarcadero Center (mall), and only a couple blocks from the Ferry Plaza and Embarcadero. The location alone is worth it here let alone that it's a nice hotel.Also, as noted in many previous posts, parking is significantly steep at this hotel (as it is at most hotels around the city). I followed someone else's suggestion and parked at 1 Embarcadero Center (literally across a two lane street) for $32 dollars a day. This was a fine option and the walk was minimal at most.Pros:-Location, Location, LOCATION-Nice rooms-Good check-in and pleasant staffCons:-Not the best view?-Parking is expensive

<Content>Excellent choice We stayed for two nights at Le Meridien in late December 2008, and found it to be an excellent choice for staying in the city. We chose Le Meridien based on positive recommendations on TripAdvisor, combined with an unbeatable rate for four star accommodations. We were especially impressed with the professionalism of the staff-- when our trip to SF was delayed by a day due to a cancelled flight, the reservations clerk immediately offered to move our reservation forward a day, despite the fact that our rooms were technically a prepaid internet rate with no changes allowed. In addition, the front desk was very helpful with a speedy check-in after midnight (again due to airline delays), and our 15th floor room could not have been nicer or cleaner. The faux-corner view of the Bay Bridge (through opening sliding glass doors) was terrific, as was the quality of the bedding.  Lastly, the location was ideal-- after witnessing the chaos of the hordes of tourists in the Union Square area, we were relieved that we had chosen LM's location in the much less hectic financial district location. With the Ferry Building and Embarcadero BART station within walking distance, as well as the inviting Elephant and Castle pub across the street, we felt like there was plenty going on near the hotel, yet without the Times Square-ish atmosphere of the overtouristy Union Square area and the many luxury hotels located in that area. Overall, we were extremely pleased with Le Meridien-- especially given the great price-- and would gladly return the next time we are in San Francisco.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, less than perfect service. The room was really very elegant and comfortable and the bed was wonderful...but...the staff was not very helpful or friendly. No one we phoned at the hotel seemed to have any knowledge about the rooms or have particularly good phone manners, but we booked one of their more expensive rooms hoping our needs would be covered. On arriving we were rushed into the front door, then, although we had requested an early check in (1 hour), were told our room would probably not be ready even by normal check in time! We later found out that rooms were, in fact, ready and available. Also, be sure to put out the privacy sign at night if you don't want to be disturbed early in the morning by housekeeping entering the room. We still enjoyed our stay, but now know not to expect much in the way of service.

<Content>Impeccable choice! Found this one on tripadvisor. The hotel was immaculate, the beds extremely comfortable, the pillows were steal-able though I didn't. The room was spacious and the view was extraordinary. Linda, the concierge, was not just professional but expert. Breakfast there, while expensive, is delicious and fresh. Worth it!Fabulous location, near the Ferry terminal and all public transportation.Best of all, incredible value. Thank you tripadvisor reviewers!

<Content>Great Hotel I recently stayed 4 nights at Le Meredian on a business trip. The hotel was within minutes of the Financial District in SF as well as a large high end shopping area. Check in and check out were very efficient. The front entrance is guarded by door men and valets, so a lot of attention is given to arriving guests. The room was extremely nice. I stayed in a business suite which has an office, balcony, and an oversized bathroom. I was a fan of the room design. The bed was very fluffy with an there were about 5 pillows on the king bed. A large flat screen TV was provided, along with a fully stocked in room bar.The bathroom was extremely spacious, with both a bathtub and shower provided. There is even a great view of the Bay Bridge from the bathroom. Hot water was very quick to come out. They even had fancy bathroom soaps, shampoo's and conditioners.The fitness center is well equiped and perfect for a business traveler. I worked out 2x's over my 4 day stay. Overall I found Le Meredian be an outstanding hotel and I would stay there again on future visits to San Francisco.

<Content>Pleased! We were able to secure a wonderful rate for Thanksgiving weekend on the Le Meridian website for a studio suite @ $145. The amount was paid in advance (something I never do), but all was fine. The location is very nice and perfect for access to everything we love in the city, and although coffee was set out in the bar area in the morning, a Starbucks  Peets Coffee was next door and across the street! Some of our favorite restaurants were within a 2 block walk.We drove from Santa Barbara, and to offset the $51 parking fee per night (that's the SF), we parked @ SFO for $14 per day and took the BART to the Embarcadero stop, then walked 3 blocks...easy peezy and fast. This was the Park Hyatt @ one time, but now is a meticulously maintained and lovely property. The room was spotless and spacious (#2106). Great view of the Coit Tower and bay. The window opened :)... providing the ocean breeze...which is a must for us. The bed was comfortable, but my only gripe, but important, was that the sheets were too small for the king bed...and thin. I was very surprised, as this is not the rule of thumb @ Starwood properties...hopefully this gets remedied. The feather comforter was wonderful as were the pillows. The bathroom was large with separate shower and small bath and spotlessly clean as well. This property is classy, and serenely low-key. The staff were knowledgeable and very professional. We've stayed @ Ritz Carltons, Four Seasons, Omni, independent Leading Hotels of the World, and other Starwood properties in many countries and found this to be very accomodating. My husband has found a new hotel for his future SF business as well. Merci... Le Meridian!

<Content>Excellent Hotel ... But ... (a contrarian review) My wife and I stayed at Le Meridien over the Thanksgiving weekend. We have traveled to San Francisco the day after Thanksgiving nearly every year for a number of years, to see the lighting of the Christmas tree in Union Square and the decorations and offerings in the big stores, ranging from Nieman Marcus and Bloomingdale's to Macy's, Gumps, and others.Since the hotels have virtually no business or convention travelers over the Thanksgiving weekend, most of their rates tend to be considerably lower than normal. Le Meridien was no exception.As so many other reviewers have attested, Le Meridien is a very good hotel. No argument. Our studio suite was relatively spacious and had a reasonably good view of a portion of the Bay Bridge and of Coit Tower. It was decorated in what I would call upscale contemporary and was fairly comfortable, though I would call it more designer chic than warm. No complaints; however, several of the other hotels we've stayed at in San Francisco had rooms approximately as nice, if often a bit smaller.Similarly, the hotel staff, though we had minimal interaction with them, were friendly and efficient.My two quibbles with this hotel are with things that cannot be remedied, and that are, admittedly, at least somewhat in the eye of the beholder, They are: (a) location, and (b) the lack of a truly memorable lobby or public amenities.(A) Location. Le Meridien does not have a bad location. It just has something of a blah or lackluster location. It is nearly a mile walk (level ground, if you choose the right streets) to Union Square, the historic and scenic heart of San Francisco and the center of the main shopping area. A taxi will cost about six or seven dollars each way if you include any tip. Also, L.M. has a hotel car that may be able to take you, provided that you book it in advance. Thus, location is a relatively minor quibble, but still a quibble, since there are so many other good hotels to compare to. (B) Lack of truly grand or memorable qualities. While Le Meridien has comfortable rooms and a capable staff, it lacks a certain memorable quality that a number of its compatriots have. To compare:The Hyatt Regency has a truly grand atrium lobby (the largest interior hotel lobby in the world, according to Guinness) and a location directly on the San Francisco waterfront, across from the Ferry Building and the public market. Its Christmas decorations in the atrium area are really attractive. (Le Meridien had a rather average- sized Christmas tree, little more.)The Westin Palace has its unforgettable Garden Court for dining.The Fairmont Hotel, on Nob Hill, has a grand enough facade that it was featured for the opening and closing credits of the television series Hotel (a number of years ago, but the facade and interior are still just as grand). Together with its lobby and other features, it is the very image of a grand hotel.Similarly, the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental and the Stanford Court share its top of the world location on Nob Hill.The Ritz Carlton has a facade and grandeur that many would say equals or surpasses that of the Fairmont.The Marriott, the Westin Market Street, the Westin St. Francis, the Nikko, the Hilton, the Four Seasons, the Monaco, the Campton Place, the Parc 55, and the Grand Hyatt (along with other hotels) are much closer to the shopping and restaurant scene centered on Union Square. Many of them, notably the St. Francis, are decked out regally for the holidays--and they're practically in the center of the action.In summary, Le Meridien is a very good hotel, with comfortable contemporary rooms, in a location which is okay but rather nondescript and not as convenient as that of the hotels centered around Union Squre or Nob Hill. Next time we'll probably pick a hotel closer to Union Square.

<Content>Great Stay at the Le Meridien My wife and I had a great stay at the Le Meridien. Our favorite part was the location. The hotel is located in the heart of the financial district with easy access from the airport by BART (a few blocks from the Embarcardero station). Although the tourist attractions are not right by the hotel, they are very easy to get to from this central location. Union Square is an easy walk as is Nob Hill and Fishermans Warf. There are also cable car stops a few blocks away. We were upgraded to a studio suite at check-in for no additional charge. The room was very nice with a large comfortable bed and extra seating area. The bathroom was nice and clean but nothing special.Many coffee shops in the vicinity for coffee/breakfast in the morning and a few bars as well for an evening drink.If you plan on driving, valet parking is very expensive (around $50/day). From my research, this seems to be common in this area.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We booked through the hotel web-site for $119, plus tax. We were updgraded at check-in to the 19th floor. Our room was great and it had a balcony. The room and staff were wonderful. We did not use the room service. We ate breakfast at the Nob Hill Cafe, and it is somewhat pricey ($33 for two people), but the food is really, really good. We parked in the garage at One Embarcadero for $30/night. I am sure that a better deal could be found somewhere, but we didn't have a lot of time. The hotel is a $8 cab ride to fishermans wharf and a $6 cab ride to north beach. You could walk to these places if you'd like. We will stay here the next time we are in the city.

<Content>Great Hotel at a Great Price We booked this room through Hot Wire so when I paid and saw the name I immediately came here to see the reviews. All the great reviews were right on the money!The bed was comfortable, the room was just the right size, the staff was great, and it was an excellent location as well. It was only a block to the cable car and there was a bus stop right on the corner of the hotel block. Every thing you could want was close by including China Town. Right across the street was an excellent pub called Elephant and Castle where we never had a bad meal. I would highly recommend it for breakfast, lunch or dinner and it was moderately priced. Which brings up the only bad part about the hotel; the prices at the hotel restaurant. We had breakfast there and for a regular 2 egg one meat type breakfast with coffees and juice for two people was over $50.00. It was good, but it wasn't $50 good.All in all though it was a great hotel and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great experience at Le Meridien Great stay here. The rooms were nice - floor to ceiling windows and we had a partial bay view. This hotel is dog friendly - no rules aside from putting a sign outside to warn the housekeeping. With the dog, it was very convenient - a couple blocks to some grassy areas and just a short 7 minute walk to the Ferry Building and lots of downtown restaurants. It's a bit Financial districty, but so central and close to the Embarcadero, North Beach, SoMa and Union Square. Be aware of the parking fees (around $50 per day) and breakfast added up quickly ($70!).

<Content>Worth Every Cent!!!! We Stayed At Le Meridien San Francisco During A Holiday To California September 2008. From The Moment We Stepped Out Of The Taxi Cab We Were Treated Amazingly By All The Staff At The Hotel. The Concierges Were Helpful in Giving Directions And Suggestions For Restaurants. Check-In Was Simple And The Hotel Was Able To Accomodate Our Early Check-In Request With No Problems. While High-Speed Wireless Internet Is Available At The Hotel, There Is A Fee Charged Per Day. However, The Hotel Does Have A Business Centre With 3 Computers With Highspeed Internet Available To All Guests. The Room Was Quite Spacious  The Bed Was Extremely Comfortable. There Was A Large LCD Television, But No DVD Player. However After A Day Of Sightseeing, We Found No Need For A DVD Player Anyways. Overall, Our Stay At Le Meridien Was Amazing And Worth Every Penny!!!! Would Definitely Stay Here Again.

<Content>Spectacular View and Best room imaginable! We are loyal Starwood fans and have stayed in the St. Francis and the Palace in San Francisco. Le Meridien's rooms are far superior to these. Our two rooms on the 23rd floor had spectacular views of coit tower, Washington Square cathedral, the bay and the transamerican building. The view was better than any of the hotels we have stayed in S.F. (Marriot Fisherman's wharf, St. Francis, The Palace, Omni, Milano, Grand Hyatt, Sir Francis Drake, etc. - we are in S.F. a few days each year) The staff was very cordial and professional. The rooms were amazing! We can easily say the amenities, linens, spaciousness, and luxurious bathrooms were among the nicest rooms we have stayed in anywhere. Everything was beautiful and we feel we have discovered a new favorite hotel. The financial district is great if you want to enjoy the entire city rather than just Union square. We were in S.F. for the Opera and to have brunch with a friend. A taxi to the opera was less than $10. This would mean a taxi to Union square would be under $5 and within walking distance or California street cable car. Chinatown and the Embarcadero are walking distance. Farmer's market is nearby. Museums of SOMA are a 15 minute walk or under $5 for a taxi. The restaurants of Belden Place are closer to the Omni, but only an additional 5-10 minute walk from Le Meridien. Of course the rooms at Le Meridien are far more spacious and luxurious. We had adjoining rooms at the Omni last year and viewed an alley with half the space in the rooms. If I had to choose something negative to say about the Meridien - the parking was $49. A little ridiculous.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Fantastic Location My girlfriend and I stayed at Le Meridien in San Francisco for 3 nights in September 2008.We were able to land a suite for under $200 US because we booked it in the week before we travelled and prepaid the entire stay. Fantastic rate and great value.Anyway, the hotel is very nice, and the room was very large and very well designed as well. There was a large screen plasma TV that could rotate between facing the bed or the sofa area. The staff were very pleasant and the valet service (which is mandatory if you have a car) was very quick to bring the car up.We didn't eat in the restaurant so we can't comment on that, but definitely thought it was at least a quasi-five star experience, and coupled with the value (again, under $200 a night!) left us very happy with our experience. Be sure to check the hotel website for these types of discounts, because it was much cheaper than anything we saw on other websites.The location was also tremendous. It's in the financial district, which wasn't so useful, but is a only about a 5 minute walk to the piers, 15 minutes max to Union Square, and 20 minutes to Fishermans Wharf. We also caught a Giants game and it was a nice 20 minute walk along the Embarcadero from ATT Stadium. All things considered, would absolutely stay again.

<Content>Fabulous Location Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Le Meridien in San Francisco. The hotel was clean, the rooms comfortable and the location was fabulous. The rooms: On the small side for $300 but the view was great (Room 707 - a lower floor in this 22 floor beauty) and the room had a very functional plan. Mini bar was not overpriced for SFO.The hotel: Bar 333  Bistro serves a stiff drink and is a great place to relax. Our friends enjoyed eating in the Park Grill on the 3rd floor and felt the menu was great. The fitness center offers some nice equipment to run on and lift weights. The location: Wow! A few blocks up hill and you are in Chinatown, a few blocks to the west and you are at Pier 39 and a few blocks to the east and you are shopping at Union Square. Don't overlook the Embarcadero Center across the street which has some great stores and places to eat. Late night drinks can't be beat right next door at the Elephant  Castle Pub.We did a Sonoma Wine Tour with Beau Wine Tours and it was great. We had an 8 person limo for 9 hours for under $1000 with tip and it came with champagne and a knowledgeable driver. Ask for Steve! He took us over the Golden Gate Bridge and we stopped for pictures in both directions. He recommended The Girl  The Fig for lunch in Sonoma - it was fabulous!

<Content>Great Location My husband and I just returned from a great weekend in San Francisco. We travel often, but this was our first trip to San Francisco. The Meridian Hotel was a great choice. We booked our trip through the American Express fine hotels program, therefore we received an upgraded room and daily breakfast. We arrived early in the morning and the hotel was able to accommodate our request for an early check in which was very much appreciated after a long flight. Check in was smooth and the bell service was prompt and informative. The rooms are clean and well maintained with very modern decor. We had a great view from our room on the 22nd floor. We ate breakfast in the restaurant each morning. The breakfast menu was diverse and the service in the restaurant was excellent.  The location of the hotel was great. It is close to many attractions. We were able to walk to Fisherman's Wharf, the Ferry Building, Chinatown, and the Alcatraz Ferry. The street car that runs along Embarcadero is also close to the hotel. The Alcatraz night tour was great and we especially enjoyed taking the ferry to Sausalito.  I would highly recommend this hotel for its great location, good service, and helpful staff. We followed up our weekend in San Francisco with a couple of days in Napa and Half Moon Bay. I would return to this hotel.

The hotel was amazing...super luxurious...and the best part was the hotel car that takes you anywhere you want to go with a reservation for FREE! It was a beautiful Mercedes too! Let me tell you - is so nice to have a ride take you directly from the hotel to your destination without having to look for a taxi, etc. Everyone was so welcoming an nice. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.If traveling for the first time to SF like me...do the bike tour of the Golden Gate to Sausalito and Tiburon. Highlight of our stay.

<Content>Very Nice Stay We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights at the end of August. The location was very convenient. We actually flew into SFO and took the BART train to the Embarcadero stop and were able to walk to the hotel. It's a bit of a process, but significantly less expensive than taking a taxi. We also walked down to the Embarcadero shops and restaurants and even walked all the way up to Pier 39. Being that the hotel is in the financial district, there aren't quite as many options for dining and bars at night as some other neighborhoods, but we were always able to find something. As for the hotel itself, the room was large and clean. The bathroom was fine as well. As others have mentioned, the beds were very comfortable. We had a nice view of the bay from the 18th floor. We also appreciated that they accommodated us when we requested an early check-in. We made the mistake of going to the hotel restaurant one morning for breakfast. While the omelette was good, it wasn't quite worth it's $30 price tag (I don't remember exactly how much it was, but it was something ridiculous). We used to concierge several times for recommendations and each time, we were happy. We asked for a restaurant in Chinatown and were sent to nice little restaurant where the majority of patrons were locals (which makes me a lot happier than being sent to a tourist trap). The other two restaurants the concierge suggested were also right in line with what we asked for. They also gave us good directions to a couple other places we wanted to go.All in all, I have no complaints about the hotel. We would stay there again, no question.

He greeted us by name each time we walked in and out, he meet our needs when we asked the change rooms (our room was next to the elevator and we could hear it go up and down the shaft all night).The hotel is in a great neighborhood, close to the ferry building and the embarcadero. The best thing about it is that there are no homeless people near it (this is a HUGE problem in SF)The views were magnificent!Best of all, although this is a big hotel, it felt like a small boutique hotel.The rooms were well decorated and were very large! I liked everything about this hotel, if I ever go back to SF, I will definately stay here again if I can get it for a good rate.I used to work in SF and have looked at rooms in just about every hotel and stayed at a lot of the hotels, and this is by far the best hotel I have stayed at in SF!

<Content>Awesome location Stayed here for 6 nights with my husband and son. We arrived at 11am thinking we would just drop off our luggage and hit the town. The room was surprisingly ready so we were able to check-in early. Since there were no rooms with two double beds available, we were given a room on the 17th floor with a king size bed. I requested a roll-away bed and that was delivered the next day. If I had any complaints at all, it would be having to call again for the roll-away bed but this is really a non-issue.The hotel is in a great location in the financial district. We took the BART between SFO and the hotel. At $5.35 per person one way, it is more economical than a cab. The BART station is only a few blocks away in the Embarcadero area. Also, the hotel is within blocks of lots of MUNI bus and train lines so travel is convenient. In fact, I would discourage renting a car unless necessary since valet parking is $50 + taxes per night. The pillowtop bed is incredibly comfortable. I usually don't sleep well in hotels but the Le Meridien bed is an exception. Also, the hotel was extremely quiet. Our room was very close to the elevators but I did not hear people in the hallway or in the rooms next door. The lady at the concierge desk is amazing. I swear she is a human GPS. She'll give awesome recommendations for restaurants.Check-out was easy with no surprises. Overall, this upscale hotel is highly recommended and its location is hard to beat.

<Content>Most comfortable beds ever! The hotel was very beautiful and the service was impeccable. The rooms were relatively spacious for being in downtown San Fran. Most of all though, the beds were like sleeping on a cloud. They were extremely comfortable so much so that I almost over slept and missed my seminar. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Perfect Experience I stayed at Le Meridien for three nights and everything was exactly what we wanted. We were in a room on the 21st floor with a 180 degree view of the Bay and the City. The view was great. This was my first time to San Francisco and had a lot of sightseeing plans. The hotel was in the perfect spot to use as a homebase. Walking distance from Union Square, North Beach, Chinatown, Nob Hill, SOMA and Fisherman's wharf. The staff was great. A relative surprised us with wine and cheese in the room and the staff handled it tremendously. Angela the concierge was great always able to get us reservations and sending us to restaurants that were exactly what we were looking for at the time. The room was big with a modern feel. I would highly recommend staying here to everyone.

<Content>Nicely remodeled, a bit overpriced The Le Meridian located is located in the financial district of San Francisco, and has recently undergone a major renovation. Rooms are nicely appointed, staff is friendly and efficient, and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to stay near the Embarcadero or Market Street. Rates are a bit high ($250+ per night) but that seems to be the going rate for the downtown area.

<Content>In the Middle of the City Le Meridien is a wonderful hotel. The wife and I stayed in a King mini suite, on the 18th floor. The view was spectacular, and because you can actually open the glass door to the outside you can take in some air. We were able to lean out and see much of downtown, including the Bay bridge. The place is first class, and takes care of you. As we were already in the city, we attempted a 12:45 check-in, they were more than willing to accomodate our needs. As others have stated, my only complaint is the $55 valet parking fee (only motel parking fee available). But I am sure my car was very comfortable. If you have the time, walk over to Union center, and eat the Cottage Pie at Foley's pub, excellent.

<Content>Very nice Hotel We 2 A, 2 c) booked Le Meridien via Expedia. 40% off + 1 day free. Got very nice, cleany spacious room on 20th floor. Beds are comfortable, batrooom clean and new with marmor / granite, LCD screen + large window with GREAT VIEW on downtown + bay.It is just one block to califormia st. cable car line, starbucks is across the street and a shopping mall just beside. The only down turn is the valet parking which is very expensive. if you solve this, no reason to take any other hotel  200 USD in San Francisco.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Le Meridien for three days this past July (2008) and could not have been happier with our stay. I booked the hotel through Priceline at half the published rate. The room was spacious, the bedding very comfortable, and the room nicely furnished and very clean. Staff were polite and helpful. In fact, the front desk employee upgraded our room upon check-in to one that would be more spacious than the one originally assigned to us. Great location in the Financial District. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Fantastic hotel What a wonderful hotel. I highly recommend it. Our room was fantastic. As it was our honeymoon, we were upgraded to a room on the 20th floor with a view of the city and bay. The room itself was great - modern, amazing bed and nice bathroom. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. I didn't want to leave!One complaint is the price of parking - it is valet only and was $56/night. If you stay here, park next door at the Embacadero Center as it's $30/night.

<Content>Excellent Property in Financial District I've had a number of business trips to San Francisco recently and have been slowly trying out various hotels. I have to say I was bit skeptical about staying at the Le Meridien given its location, but TripAdvisor reviews convinced me otherwise. And they were right. While I was only there overnight, I was very impressed. Check-in was the one area I'd leave for improvement, although that always comes down to the specific person. Otherwise, the hotel was immaculate, well-designed and user-friendly. In typical Starwood fashion, I was given an available upgrade to a junior suite, which was very much appreciated. The room was spacious, comfortable and trendy. They gym was iniviting and impressive. All-in-all, other than not being in the center of a lively nightlife, this is a hotel I highly recommend.

<Content>Bedbugs On the one hand, I am amazed at the positive reviews on this site, while at the same time I can appreciate them -- that is, if you avoided a room with BEDBUGS.I spent two nights at Le Meridien in October 2007. As a loyal Starwood member (though I typically stay at the W Hotel chain), I stayed there (and spent $400+/night) based on my positive prior Starwood experiences.I thought the hotel on its face was great -- excellent location, nice rooms, great views, etc. Unfortunately, I awoke Saturday morning after arriving late Friday with a series of bug bites on my torso. Given that it had been a warm fall night the evening before and I was out walking in the city both before and after dinner, I thought it possible they were mosquito bites. Not having had any prior experiences with (or knowledge of) bedbugs, I didn't give it much thought and headed out for the day.When I awoke the second morning (I returned to New York later that day), I found yet more bites -- this time much more uncomfortable and prolific -- on my arms and hands. At this point I should have figured out something was amiss, but I was in a rush to meet friends and catch my flight.Only upon returning to New York where the bites continued did I do some research, ask around, etc. and discover that I had brought home bedbugs. They ultimately infested two rooms of my home, and cost me $4000 in extermination costs and to replace my couch and headboard.Upon notifying the hotel of what had happened, I was blithely informed that after your inquiry, we checked the room and, thankfully, no pests. Multiple e-mail and phone exchanges with management were fruitless, and ultimately I gave up after a final conversation with the manager who assured me that they had received no other complaints.Having (sadly) become an expert on bedbugs, I can assure you they were acquired at THIS HOTEL. I would say stay at your own risk, keep your bags off of the floor and take all other precautions you will find on the internet on avoiding bringing home bedbugs.Good luck out there....

<Content>Wanted for nothing at this fine hotel If staying in the financial district of San Francisco, I cannot recommed Le Meridien enough. The rooms are all newly renovated, with tasteful furnishings. Service was absolutely exemplary. The in-room dining was excellent (I only ordered breakfast) although quite expensive. The room was reasonably priced for this part of SF, and if you appreciate fine service and attention to detail, this is your hotel.

<Content>It's Okay I stayed at the Le Meridien for 4th of July weekend with my fiance in a Studio Suite. The bed was comfortable and the LG tv was great (the tv did not rotate so we could not view the tv in the living room area). The bathroom was too small and it did not have enough counter space. The bell boys never asked us if we needed help with our bags,they just looked. The conceirge was slow and we waited for over 15 minutes for help. We liked the bartender but the bar was too small and people were standing over us while we enjoyed our drinks. Room service had great food. Overall I wouldn't stay at this hotel again. There were too many small problems that we did not like.

<Content>Amazing location! My boyfriend and I were in San Francisco for the Memorial Day long weekend and had a wonderful stay at Le Meridien. It's the perfect location for people who want to throw on their walking shoes and explore the city. We did a walking tour through China Town (fodor's has a great one on their website), North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf. We did opt to rent a car for transportation to and from the airport as well as two day trips (Muir Woods  Napa), but the parking is extremely expensive. Park across the street at the Embarcadero Center lot for only $30 per day (vs $50 at the hotel). We actually parked on the street on Sunday since you don't have to feed the meters and we had to leave early Monday morning anyway. If you plan on going to Muir Woods, definitely get there early because by noon (Saturday or Sunday) parking is hard to find. Also, we did a tour of Alcatraz which we highly recommend. Make sure to book your tickets online well in advance of your visit because it's highly unlikely that you can get tickets within 72hrs of wanting to take the tour. The tour was sold out for 6 days when we arrived. Last transportation hint, use the Embarcadero trolley line for $1.50 per person (exact change only) instead of cabbing it or parking near Fisherman's Wharf. The ticket can be used for hours after purchase, so it's a great way to save a few bucks.One great perk for the hotel (which my boyfriend found) was the free shoe-shines. There are special bags in the closet which have the details on them. You call down to the front desk, they pick up yours shoes and have them back within a half hour. The last night, we checked out a comedy show right across the street from the hotel at the Punchline Comedy Club. It was a great time!

<Content>Will be back! We got a great rate $155. Stayed May 31 and June 1. We loved it.Fabulous large room with view of bay. The room had a huge comfortable king bed with premium linens. Spacious marble bath with all 5 star amenities. Hotel is in great location close to Chinatown, NorthBeach and Embarcadero. We opted for room service 1 night and like most big hotels the room service was really pricey $68 for 2 burgers and 2 iced teas. (excellent burger by the way)I think the most notable thing about this hotel was the service. With the exception of one clueless doorman, everyone was wonderful. We requested a coffee setup in our room and it wasdelivered in 5 minutes. Excellent service from the bell service to housekeeping. Be aware that parking in San Francisco is expensive so if you do come by car expect to be charged around $50 per night to park it.As we have stayed many times in the City this is about the going rate. We parked the car and either took a cab or walked wherever we went. Taxi's in the City are not that expensive. I felt they were a lot more reasonable than what we encountered in NY City.

<Content>Awesome weekend stay in SF I was working in Sacramento and had to stay over the weekend, so I went in to SF on Friday night. I booked the Le Meridien over Expedia for an amazing rate. The hotel was insanely busy, but the check-in process was reasonable and they had my room, so I was happy. Upon arriving in my room, I discovered the amazing views they have. A corner of the room is floor-to-ceiling windows and in hangs out of the edge of the building. You can pull the reading chair in to the space and just stare out at the city.The breakfast price was a bit ridiculous, so I went out for b-fast both days, and also ate out for lunch and dinner. The location is very convenient for all the tourist sites and catching a trolley.

<Content>Very Nice Rooms I checked into the hotel on Friday evening. I was given a business suite. The suite was very spacious. Although I was only on the 8th floor, I had views of the bay out of all of my windows. My room also had a small balcony. My only criticism is that the hotel advertises that a courtesy shuttle is offered a night. Although the hotel does have a Mercedes S Class sedan that takes guests around town, you have to make a reservation well in advance. I was never able to use that service and I suspect that most guests will not be able to use that service.

It was a fantastic stay and I found great restaurants and nightlife within easy walking distance. The bed was the best ever, everything was top notch. My room had a tiny balcony, really just a ledge, but the door opened fully for fresh air. I did not dine in the hotel, but have no doubt it would have been excellent too. Staff was friendly and great. Hotel is pricey, but has great weekend rates. Go stay here, you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Excellent service and value Spent Friday and Saturday night at the end of April for the grand price of $ 121. per night for 3 persons through Travelocity. Suggest parking at the Embarcadero across the street - $30.00 for 24 hours. Parking at the hotel is $ 49.00 per night. Cab ride to Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf is $ 7.00 each way. For a meal, suggest the Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macy鈥檚 鈥?Union Square location. Great view from the ninth floor including the activities at Union Square. Walk to the Ferry Building which has a market and restaurants as well as a great view of the bridge to Oakland. Comfortable walk to Chinatown, Union Square, Nob Hill, Embarcadero, Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf etc. Our room was spacious, clean, beautifully appointed, comfortable bed with white linens and comforter. While we did not pay for bay view room, we were given a room with a partial bay view facing the ferry building and Embarcadero. This was a bonus for us as it was very pleasant view. There was a night club next door 鈥?Friday night was quiet but could hear the loud music on Saturday night 鈥?would be an issue if you are a light sleeper. For the price we paid we had no complaints and we would return. Excellent service, very polite and courteous staff 鈥?check in took all of 3 minutes.

From the initial contact at check in, to departure the next day, the staff was very helpful. We had a room on the north side, 18th floor. The view from the room made it had to go out for dinner. We will be back, as this was one of the best hotel experience we've had in the CIty. Be sure to make dinner reservations in the area early since the restaurants around the hotel were busy and the grill at the hotel was expensive.

<Content>Rooms just ok, staff needs training I recently stayed at Le Meridien on a business trip. My problem with the hotel was not that it had problems, but that staff members didn't even pretend to care. When someone (from staff) knocked repeatedly on my door at 6:30 in the morning for no reason, there was no apology. When I told them at checkout, there was no apology. When I asked about wireless access in the lobby (which I had already been promised and I had paid for), I was told casually that it didn't work. When I pointed out that I had paid for it and it was a problem, no one seemed to care. Management needs to take a closer look at teaching staff to at least pretend like they care about guests.

<Content>Good if you can get a deal. We were quite happy with our stay at this hotel. It was clean and designed well. We paid less than $200 for the night, but the regular rate in normal seasons is more than twice this. We would consider staying here again if the price is right, but for what they normally charge, it is outrageous. I'd put it in the same quality as Hotel Nikko, The Orchard, The Argent (all which are good, if under $200). But if you aren't looking at a deal, look elsewhere (like the Fairmont, if the price is similar). We didn't find the hotel to be anything special compared to other hotels we have stayed in in the city. That said, it was a good stay. The room was nice. The location was good. If you like to walk, it is easy to get to Chinatown, North Beach, Embarcadero, etc. I will disagree with the poster who stated there was nowhere to eat nearby. As long as you are willing to walk 5 - 10 minutes, you can reach more than 100 options (Chinatown and North Beach). If you do stay here, park across the street at Embarcadero One. It's $30 for 24 hours. The hotel charges $50. On a weekend, you can find street parking for free. Just make sure you read the signs and know if you need to move your car. We parked at the Embarcadero.

<Content>Gimme a break I can only guess that the other reviewers stayed in some other version of this property than i stayed in, as the loud party next door only ceased to be a distraction when i was moved at 2 AM. Also, the renovations that were to have been completed, and feel free to confirm this, but they were definitely still painting. Kind of sad because the location, the exterior, the setting, everything the others said is true, it's just the staff, ask them for anything, toothpaste, shaving cream, no help, but directions and they draw a map of the state of California. Could use quality control but mostly, they could use selectivity when it comes to parties. I'm not sure there is anything special about the property but i can see where others could think so, as it could be so much better.

<Content>Hip SF Hotel We stayed in a suite that was very nicely decorated with a big plasma tv that was in the center of the room so you could watch it in bed or in your private living area. That was the first nice suprise. It was such a pleasure to stay in a hip luxury hotel. I highly recommend this hotel since it's very central making cab fare moderate for going to different neighborhoods. Our stay was too short so we didn't have a chance to check out the bar in the hotel lobby, next time.

<Content>Loved Loved this place Was looking for a weekend get away to SF and found a great deal on this hotel. Booked the room through Expedia. According to them, the normal rate was $500+ per night. We got the room for $159.00 for a Saturday night. Great place to stay, so clean, fresh, modern, excellent staff, room was beautiful, nice flat screen, DVD player, stereo, perfect. No complaints at all. Location is near the Embarcadero and the Ferry Building. Great location if you like walking around and blending in with the locals. Since it was a weekend, most restaurants near the hotel were closed, but that was fine since we had dinner and evening plans elsewhere. Another bonus, since this is near the Bay Bridge side of the City, it was rather quiet at night so we were able to sleep with the window open and not be kept awake with road/street noise! This is my new place to stay for weekend get aways to SF.

<Content>PERFECT IN EVERY WAY There's a reason I like staying in Starwood Hotels--they strive for excellence and meet all of my expectations as a frequent Starwood hotel guest. Le Meridien Hotel is no exception. Perfect hotel in every way. The staff was extremely competent, helpful and polite. I stayed here on business, but also brought my son. The hotel provided me with a babysitter (licensed  bonded) who was an absolute gem. We were upgraded to a studio suite with a king bed. Gorgeous view of the bay. Huge room, huge bathroom. Every amenity you could think of. Plenty of room to move around, even with an extra rollaway cot, ironing boards and multiple computers. Room service excellent, especially breakfast. Great coffee. Close to everything. Valet very quick. The bed was the most comfortable bed ever, and I never wanted to get out of it. The most restful sleep ever in a hotel. I will definitely stay here again. Best hotel I've stayed at in San Francisco. This hotel is rated 5 stars and deserves every star.

<Content>Best hotel in Financial District and city Firstly, the statement from the last reviewer commenting that Le Meridien Hotel in San Francisco does not have an on-site gym is incorrect. It actually has one of the best on-site gyms featured in a hotel-a weight machine for every body part, free weights and every cardio machine you can think of, not to mention it is open to guests 24 hours a day. For a daily gym-goer this is very important to me and I will always stay here for that reason alone. As far as the rest of the hotel, I find the service to be impeccable and apparently the concierge staff are know to be the finest and most knowledgeable in the city. The rooms have breathtaking views of the city and bay and are extremely spacious. The hotel has implemented an art program and now provide complimentary passes to Yerba Buena Arts Center for all guests at check in. A nice, classy touch I would say! I love this hotel and would recommend highly for any type of traveler!

<Content>The same old business - and not a hint of French romance My wife and I live in the Bay Area and stayed at the Le Meridien on SPG points for a single night to get away from the kids for a bit. Because the property was recently taken over by the Le Meridien brand of Starwood (it was formerly the Park Hyatt), we were hoping that Starwood would have spruced the place up a bit, consistent with other Le Meridien properties. How wrong we were. The place is pure business hotel, and a rather dark and musty one at that. Not a hint of charm on the property. Also, there is no on-site gym - you must travel ten blocks, although then you do get to use the swanky Bay Club. Nothing was particularly awful, we just hoped for much more from a hotel of this rating.

<Content>Comfy, modern rooms... Just returned from a weekend stay (Feb 16-18 2008). After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, I checked out the hotel's website and and discovered they were running a sale good for select weekends of 2008. Found a room for $150 (+taxes) and decided to jump on the opportunity for a weekend getaway. We flew into Oakland and used the Airbart+BART system to get into SF (the cost is $6.55 each way). It's very convenient to use either SFO or Oakland to get into town; I highly recommend it. We packed light so it was no problem at all to walk the 3 blocks from the Embarcadero (or Montgomery) BART stations to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at noon and expected to drop off our luggage, we were surprised to find that our room was ready so they checked us in early. The room we booked through the sale was for 2 double beds, but we requested a King bed instead and were quickly accommodated. Nice, easy process with polite and professional staff.Rooms are tastefully decorated with very modern, but very comfy furniture. Nice bathroom, great-smelling toiletries, nicely stocked mini-bar but you can expect to pay 4 star prices for the snacks and drinks.For some quick, inexpensive breakfast choices walk through The Embarcadero Center mall. Or keep walking and check out the choices in in The Ferry Building.The hotel is located in the financial district so entertainment/night life in the immediate surrounding area is non-existent, but this is SF so walk just a few blocks and you'll join the hustle and bustle of the city.The concierge was very helpful in booking dinner at Chaya. My only slight disappointment is that the complimentary car service was never available for our use. I guess we'll try to do book that way in advance the next time we visit this hotel.

<Content>Loved Le Meridien!! We came to SF for the NADA Convention, so we booked through their vendor. Paid $299/nt for a King room. Not a bad price when every hotel in town is booked. We arrived on a Thursday- early, that is key to attending a convention. We were graciously upgraded to a King room with a city and a bay view on the 23rd floor. Ask for room 2310 for an awesome view! Our view encompassed the Trans America building, Coit tower, part of the Bay Bridge and the surrounding water and city. The best of both!! Many thanks to the front desk staff- Joshua.The room was very comfortable for the two of us, my husband and I. The bed was great - pillows/comforter, etc. Contemporary, simple elegance was the decor. The location gets an A+. No crowds, no noise and seemed safe- always a big factor for us when travelling. The Ferry Terminal was a quick walk-great! As were several restaurants and shops. We took a quick ride on the Muni tram ($1.50 each) from the Ferry Terminal over to Fisherman's Warf. Fast and very easy. We also took the BART to and from the airport- very easy. Take a cab from BART stop to the hotel-short ride.Save the $45 for dinner! So many great choices. We loved Ozumo's for Sushi! The Concierge staff gets an A+ as well. William stood out for his very professional manner, knowledge and his ability to help you with every situation. He always recommended the perfect restaurants. While multi-tasking, He always gave VIP service to all. Many thanks William for all of your help. You are a great asset to the hotel. The Fitness Center is also very good. Very Clean, neat. Fresh towels, water, fruit. The machines were all working. The Housekeeping staff will even wash your workout clothes for free that day! We ate one breakfast at the hotel's Park Grill. The food and service was excellent- A+. The only downside is that they charge $6.00 for a cup of coffee. Go in the Lobby and get a delicious free cup first. You can't go wrong with this hotel. My husband said after we were home that he missed Le Meridien. That is a very rare statement coming from him. Don't hesitate to book it. I did because of what other Trip Advisor reviewers wrote and they were right- it's great!

<Content>If you find a good price you need to saty here My husband and I went on a short trip to San Fran. I wanted to stay downtown and found a really good deal on hotels.com This hotel was the nicest hotel I have stayed in for a long time. The room was big, we had a great view of the Bay bridge and coit tower. It is in the finial district so pretty quite at night. there were a few bars around and also a movie theater. The hotel does have a town car sercive so we had them drop us off at Fog city dinner and then we just walked back. i woudl not pay the listed price for the room but we got a great room for $170.

<Content>Felt like a celebrity! We found a low rate on Travelocity. Contacted Le Meridien directly and got the low rate, plus another 10% off. I mentioned that it was our anniversary and asked for a room on one of the higher floors. We booked a junior suite for $135. When we arrived, we found out that we were upgraded to a full King Suite on the 24th floor. The room also had a jacuzzi tub. The view of the bay was beautiful. (Ths was a $600 room) The concierge knew our name and greeted us by name whenever we entered the lobby. Location is great and you can easily walk to Union Square and the piers. Had a wonderful stay and would love to stay there again.

<Content>Well Done! This was the former Park Hyatt Hotel in San Francisco. Recently the hotel changed hands and is now Le Meridien. It's a perfect business location in the heart of the financial district and near the embarcadero. Business travelers will love the location, however leisure travelers may find it just a bit too far from the heart of the city, things like Union Square.The hotel's lobby feels a little cold to me. It is all marble and chrome and seems a little dated and a little sterile and cold.However the staff is great and very helpful and warms up the cold lobby with their smiles.The rooms are nice, they are a bit on the small side, but have nice amenties like cozy comforters and great products in the bathroom.Some of the rooms have stunning views of the bay. We were not so lucky as our view looked into buildings and you could just make out some of the bay.The service level was good, I personally like the location that is a little out of the hussle and bussle of the tourist mobs. However I think the lobby is dated and the hotel could use a make-over.This is a good choice for San Francisco, but not my first choice.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful... We (My wife and another couple) chose this hotel originally because of a great deal we received. When we arrived, the bellhop and valet were right there and ready to offer assistance. When we checked in we asked about the possibilities of getting DVD players in our room, there was a brief bit of explaining that would be an extra charge. However, when we explained we were told when we booked the rooms the DVD players would be included in our rate, the front desk immediately checked and before we had unpacked our bags they were being installed. After this brief problem we headed to our rooms. On opening the door we were greeted with a very plush, modern room that was nicely decorated. What put this stay over the top, and made us in awe of this hotel was the concierge. We stopped by the desk for some recommendations on dinner and when we were finished the concierge had scheduled reservations at two restaurants, scheduled the hotel's car to take us and pick us up on one of the evenings, and rescheduled our cancelled Alcatraz tour. Every restaurant recommended was delicious. The staff at this hotel rose above and beyond and made our stay wonderful.

It has beautiful rooms, marshmallow-like comfortable beds and marble bathrooms. The staff were also very professional, courteous and friendly.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel- Always enjoy staying here We decided to spend our New Year's in SF. After checking many hotel sites for prices, we turned to Hotwire saw a great room deal for a 4 1/2 star hotel, and by the comments figured it was Le Meridian. We were frequent Park Hyatt customers, so were anxious to return. Well the hotel is the same, with high quality standards. We checked in quickly, and had a nice room with two sliders opening to a view of the Bay Bridge and Ferry Building through the Embarcadero office towers. Nice big bathroom and really comfortable bed. Room was spotless. Our bags were delivered by the bell man, and he filled the ice bucket before he left us. We had contacted the concierge before arriving for help in making brunch reservations, and what a pleasure it was to deal with the concierge staff- very friendly, helpful, and professional. Would definately return to this property, it is very relaxing to return to after a day out in the city.

The entire family loved the hotel, everyone went out of their way to help with the slightest request and the location was perfect for walking to Chinatown or even Union Square (a nice 10 minute walk). Rooms were large and the bed very comfortable. Bathrooms were all done in marble and very nice, only thing I wished for was a larger tub to soak in after walking all day!Really enjoyed it and will be staying there on our next trip to SF.

<Content>Not that good! My family stayed there for 3 nights, loved some things and disliked others. The concierges were great! Front desk staff were lousy. The walls were also very thin, you could hear everything that goes on next door. Our stay hit bottom when we checked out and was charged 3 nights instead of 2. We had reserved our room under the stay 2 nights and get 1 free package that was on their website. Not only was the offer not honored but the staff on duty was rude and lazy, didn't want to lift one finger to help, basically just refused to do anything about that mistake. I had to yell to get the manager to reverse the charge. Bottomline, would not stay there again for that price. Want to find a hotel with better service.

<Content>Can't Wait to Go Back! I was a little apprehensive about the financial district location on the weekend, but after visiting the Union Square area for shopping, I was thankful to have such a peaceful place to return to.The hotel was the best I've stayed at in SF. I rarely say this, but the staff were incredible. Everyone aknowledged you coming and going, the concierge was friendly and helpful, they pressed the elevator button for you if they saw you coming loaded with packages, etc. In the morning, coffee was available in the lobby and in mid-morning, hot cider and tea cakes. (I learned later that you could request an in-room coffee pot.)The room was huge, and with SPG Gold, I got a bay view room for $139. The bed was incredible. I don't understand the previous comment about the sliding bathroom door. In my mind, it gets the door completely out of the way.I would go out of my way to stay here in SF. I didn't want to leave, and I can't wait to go back.

<Content>VIP treatment and comfort with value This is a great hotel, especially if you are staying several days and are using it as a launch pad for destinations in and out of the city.The rooms are exceedingly spacious, comfortable, and feature a lot of nice amenities that make you feel at home. A mild criticism is that the lighting could be slightly better, and that the Internet connection price is a bit steep. The rooms - and facility as a whole - are very quiet, so even when the hotel is busier, you feel as though you have the entire place to yourself. Check-in and check-out took less than a minute, which was outstanding. The customer service is impeccable - with the staff making sure to address you by name - and gives the guest the feeling that they are VIP's.The neighborhood where the hotel is situated is in the heart of the Financial District, which felt very safe and was quiet. It is within easy walking distance to transit and the cable cars. I would think this is a plus to those traveling with family and/or children.All in all, I highly recommend this hotel, and will definitely stay there again. What you get for the price is quite a bargain for San Francisco, and the customer service is definitely a reason to compel me to return.

Newspaper was at our doorstep each morning and near reception desk self service coffee table is available for guests. I also needed to use the hotel's overnight dry cleaning service and my coat was ready for me early in the morning. Concierges were also friendly and helpful. Other than that location is very good although in weekends you may feel a wee bit deserted. Our room was spacious and the veranda with view to the bay bridge was magnificent. I would expect, however, a free use of internet.

<Content>Great Location, Nice Hotel We stayed there for 3 days while doing everything possible in San Francisco and it was great. Of course, the great part was that we got the hotel for $93/night off Priceline, and the hotel that weekend was going for $469/night. :-)When we checked in, we could tell there were problems. The staff seemed a little stressed (but they were still pleasant) and some people were waiting a long time. We showed up looking scruffy, having just driven for about 9 hours down the coastal highway. The guy who helped us was most pleasant and professional. He said they were overbooked, and we said we'd already purchased and paid for our rooms. He went into the back to check with a manager, and then checked us all in. One of us (me :-( ) got the last standard room they had in the place. The 2 other couples with us were upgraded to Suites! All for $93 a night. Amazing. Never once did they balk at giving us those rooms at that price. The rooms were nice and clean. Beds comfy. Robes great. Sliding door to the bathroom just plain stupid. I liked that you could open a window to get fresh air. Couldn't hear any street noise, but we were in the Business district on the weekend. We didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food. But the location was excellent. A few blocks to Chinatown and the water. Not a bad walk to Fisherman's Wharf. The subway is also just a few blocks away. The Embarcadero Center is attached to the hotel via a walk-way; we ate there for dinner one night and parked our car there. Cheaper than Valet and very convenient! We paid about $30 a day.We ate at the Elephant and Castle across the street and it was fine. The staff was really pleasant, food ok. (not real British food, but they tried!)Overall we'd stay there again.

<Content>Excellent but pricey My husband and I spent 7 nights at Le Meridien as the first leg of our honeymoon. I chose Le Meridien after the wonderful experience we had at the one in Budapest some years ago and the good ratings it had received from other travellers.We booked it via American Express as they were doing a deal, buy two nights and get third free, so we booked in blocks to make up a week.We arrived at the hotel at approx 10pm. Check-in was quick and efficient and the staff were very pleasant.Our room was on the top floor and was on the corner so we got views of the city and the sea which was great.The room was amazing. Spotlessly clean. It had a separate lounge area, the bedroom and then a bathroom which was absolutely massive.The king-sized bed was really comfy and I probably had the best nights sleep in it that I've had in a long time. There was plenty of wardrobe and drawer space. The bathroom was all marble tiled with a huge sink and a bath with shower over it. Toiletries were very nice.The room was made up every day.The hotel concierge were very helpful and only too keen to assist when my husband left his coat and jumper in the back of a taxi. We eventually got them back. They also supplied is with very large umbrellas upon request to cater for a very rainy day at Alcatraz.There is a little business room hidden at the rear of the concierge desk that you wouldn't otherwise know about. We were informed of it by some other English guests who we met. We just asked to use it and there is free internet use and facilities to print out.A good thing I noticed towards the end of our stay was compimentary tea and coffee served in one side of the entrance lounge in the mornings. I think they only did it until about 10am though, because one morning I checked and there was nothing there.The hotel's location in the financial district was excellent for us. It was a bit out of the way of the main shopping area and therefore a little bit quieter I think. It was still only a 5/10mins walk into the main centre and it was still very close to restaurants and pubs.We ended up paying about 拢300 per night for our stay, which at the time of booking we didn't mind because it was our honeymoon. However, having stayed in a Marriott hotel for the second week of our honeymoon, for more than 拢100 less per night, I think we did pay quite a lot of money for what we got at the Meridien. We did enjoy the huge room and brilliant view but I'm sure there were other just as nice hotels offering more for their money.

<Content>Best Concierge I have ever met We got an excellent rate for this hotel on Expedia. Since we have been to San Francisco many times, we didn't care so much about where we stayed and the price was right. Our room was very nice and comfortable. Quiet. Good view of the TransAmerica tower...partial view of the bay. Location was tourist friendly. Easy to get to most tourist sights. The shining star of this hotel was the concierge staff. They were all good but Laura stood out. She sent us to 4 very good restaruants. I watched as she greeted regulars and how she handled a problem with a tour operator that failed to pick up some guests. She had the patience of a saint while helping a couple book multiple tours over a 4 day period. She was awesome!

<Content>This property is not on a par with the Park Hyatt it replaced Since I stayed at this property many times when it was a Park Hyatt, I decided to try it out as Le Meridien. The property looks the same with some very minor furniture and rug changes in the lobby. Our suite on 19 looked the same with the exception of new carpeting. Perhaps I am nitpicking, but my sense of the lobby staff was that they are not as polished as the prior Park Hyatt staff. I did see some familiar faces and was greeted warmly by the outside bellman who remembered me. We ordered room service dinner that evening and I must say the food was substandard for the level of this property. The caesar salad was terrible and the chicken and fish dishes we ordered were mediocre. The room service tab was $100 for diner style food. Housekeeping staff was excellent, both in room cleaning and turn down service, friendly and efficient. I hated the soaps in the tub and sink. Seemed like ' natural' soaps that were slim in size and melted too quickly. I prefer a hard milled soap in a hotel and these seemed like craft fair soaps, more natural ? The guest profile during my stay struck me as convention or tour group types. Call me judgemental but the people staying at this property were a few notches below the previous Park Hyatt guest. Most were loud, mannerless, annoying to my ears, oh well. All in all its a good location in the embarcadero close to sights and good restaurants, a good long walk to Union Square. Good views if you're lucky to get a bay view room/suite. I just feel for a supposedly luxury brand this Le Meridien falls a bit short.

<Content>Great mix of corporate and boutique It's in a great location in downtown San Francisco - about two blocks from the Ferry Terminal Building, and about three blocks from the TransAmerica building.The person who checked us in was very friendly, and although we were on the lowest hotel floor (7), we had great views of the Bay Bridge from a small balcony. We had a small office area with a desk and two chairs, which was great for setting up a laptop. Unfortunately the wireless access isn't free.The decor is modern - more boutique hotel than corporate. The bed was really nice and comfortable. The bathroom was large and the products were nice. There's a large gym in the basement of the hotel. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great location, very comfy hotel The beds are extra comfy and fluffy, the bathrooms are decked out in marble. It's a very cushy place in the middle of the business district. We had a great view and enjoyed opening up our sliding door to get a San Fran breeze. The bar is fun downstairs and bartenders very nice to chat with. Ended up chatting with the nicest couple from England at the bar. The concierge was excellent and pointed us in the right direction every time. It's a short walk through the Embarcadero buildings (with lots of shopping to distract you) to the Piers and cable car line.

<Content>Terrific Stayed here for 7 days from the labor day w/end. This was my first visit to San Francisco and really did not know what to expect, there were so many hotels to chose from. What a bonus to have picked Le Meridien. Had a room on the 21st floor with a lovely view, but the best thing of all that it was Quiet- quiet - quiet. Our room was opposite the lift but honestly did not hear a single thing outside of the room for the entire seven days. Remarkable!!

<Content>Ok - nothing special I came to San Francisco on a business trip and having read some of the other reviews here I'm wondering if I'm staying in the same hotel. I've stayed in a lot of hotels around the world and for me this hotel is strictly average. Why do I say that?? Well ... 1) Location - it is 20 mins walk to Union square area, 10 mins to China town and there's little in the immediate area. Overall not really very great for anywhere - there are many hotels much much closer to the main shopping areas 2) The rooms - decor is fine but they aren't very big. I had a bay view room on the 22nd and would have expected more for this class of hotel 3) Gym - it is really small, no pool, about 15 machines, not even a changing room so you have to go between there and your room in your sweaty gym kit - nice for everyone else using the elevator ! 4) Other facilities - well there aren't really any apart from a bar and a restaurant. Overall, this hotel for me as a 4* is ok but that's all. It is small and lacks anything to make me feel that I would want to stay here again. I'm sure you can do better elsewhere for similar or lower rate - try the Ritz Carlton (amazing) or the 4 Seasons (very nice) or the Marriott (good).

<Content>Overall nice hotel We stayed at this hotel because we had a wedding rate and close to reception. Very nice room, we were on the 19th floor with a beautiful view of the bay and city. Could see the sail boats and bay bridge from the room. Typical furniture, tv was a little low when viewing in bed. The king bed was very comfy. The bathroom mirrors were excellent, but the bathroom door was a little wierd. It was on a sliding track, like a pocket door, but it didn't close all the way. There was a gap between the door and the wall. It was not broken, that was the way it was. The hotel staff was very nice. When we checked in the lady gave us our keys and we went up the elevator. Looked at the key folder for our room number and she forgot to write it down. Doormen were very helpful, and even drove us to the ferry building in the hotel car cause we were late to catch a ferry. If you are looking to stay close to the piers, I would probably stay somewhere else. In the financial district, this is a nice hotel.

<Content>Le Meridien San Francisco: comfy beds, amazing location and good food I normally travel on business and truly enjoy taking advantage of my starwood points. And this weekend stay at Le Meridien was no different, except that it's in my home town. I stayed here to rest, eat food, get room service and explore my own town on foot. The location really is perfect and it's almost like our little secret. It's in the financial district which is only a few FLAT blocks from chinatown, union square, fisherman's wharf, giant's stadium and BART. There's good shopping across the street and it's not crowded on the weekends because it's a local mall. The only outdoor mall in SF, actually.But, I didn't spend a ton of time at the mall because I also wanted to just hang out at the hotel. I ate a few times at Bar 333 and ordered lots of room service. One of the best things in this world is room service when it's done right. Le Meridien's team is top notch. One day their soup of the day was to die for and their ceasar salad has the best dressing. It comes with very fresh anchovies, but it doesn't have to if that's not your thing. The bar was good too. Cool music, really comfy down pillows on the lounch couches and it's fun to sit by the window and peopel watch while sipping the best martini I think I've had while living in SF. I highly recommend this hotel and in fact, a ton of my colleagues are taking me up on it. Internet speed is awesome, check in is quick, the rooms are clean, comfy and well suited to single people on up to families wishing to experience SF.

<Content>expedia price couldn't be beat We got an amazing rate at Le Meridien -- about $160 per night, which is unbelievable for San Francisco. When I checked in with two teenagers, the kind woman at the front desk said, I bet they'd like a view... and promptly put us in a room with a bay view on the 24th floor. Everything was perfectly clean, the view was amazing. The concierge was friendly, knowledgable and helpful. I would call this a great business hotel. I'm not sure I'd agree that it's a five-star hotel, as some ads claim, but it's a solid four-star stay in a great location.

<Content>Great Hotel ... Great Room! LOVED THIS PROPERTY!! Upon checking in, the hotel lobby had an inviting look and a jazzy soundtrack filling the space. Once I got to my room, I was shocked at the size of it! Like a true Starwood property, the linens, furniture and special touches instantly made the trip excellent. The New York suite was enormous and full of ample seating, windows, views, tvs and room to stretch out. Yes ... two televisions! The work space was large and roomy with a very fast internet connection. Not to mention that room service was not only delish, but arrivied very fast. The hotel bar is a great place to meet friends after work or before dinner ... and the bartenders will even remember your drink if you return the next night! Would I stay again and recommend ... you bet!

<Content>Great experience at Le Meridien My family (husband and 2 teenaged daughters) stayed at Le Meridien for 3 nights recently and were quite pleased with the experience. I was a little bit apprenhensive at first when I made the booking because I thought perhaps we should stay closer to Union Square since our two teeenaged daugthers were with us. As it turned out, the location of Le Meridien is actually quite ideal. It's close to many attractions and it's still within walking distance to Union Square.Our room had a great view, was well appointed and we received excellent service from everyone at the hotel, especially from the concierge and housekeeping staff. In fact, one of my daughters left her expensive hair straightener in the room, and when she called the hotel after she found out it's missing, the housekeeping staff (Tecla?) was able to find it right away and shipped it back to us promptly. We were very impressed with her professional manner and caring. We would definitely consider staying at this hotel again on our future visits to San Francisco.

<Content>Lovely experience and good value in a pricey city My husband and I stayed for two nights in June as a leisurely side-trip after attending a family event in the Bay area. I booked several months in advance via the hotel's website, and chose a Studio Suite at about $300/nt. In a tricky city for hotels, I felt this would be a good compromise between expense and comfort, and we were not disappointed. In fact, Le Meridien exceeded our expectations in many regards.Check-in was smooth and efficient, and the concierge and door staff were consistently courteous. Location was excellent: we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, but were removed from crowds and noise around Union Square.The room was larger than I expected, with a very comfortable bed and a pleasant sitting area featuring wonderful views of the Bay Bridge. The bathroom was also large and beautifully equipped with separate shower and tub. Closet space was adequate but not unusually capacious. Everything--linens, carpets, upholstery, bathroom surfaces--was spotless (and I am the sort of person who notices every speck). Really, housekeeping was superb. The room's other great advantage was its exceptional calm--we heard absolutely nothing from other rooms, and extremely little street noise. In terms of services and amenities, we used the small business center behind the concierge desk to check in with work (ugh) and print boarding passes, and had no problems with connectivity or waiting for a workstation to free up. We took advantage of the hotel's restaurant for breakfast each morning and were again pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and very friendly service. It seemed to be a popular spot for business breakfasts, so we felt a teensy bit out of place without power suits on, but we didn't mind since the smoked salmon and other offerings were so delicious we soon forgot about our surroundings. We were really pleased with our stay here. Historic or romantic it is not, but in a city where hotel rooms are often tiny, outdated, and noisy, Le Meridien made us extremely comfortable for a price not nearly as high as the highest-end options in San Francisco (Four Seasons, St Regis, etc). And we were still close to all of the sights!

<Content>Great homebase in SF We had a short stay in San Francisco, but the Le Meridien was a great homebase for our purposes. The common areas of the hotel were beautifully appointed. It is modern and sophisticated, yet comfortable. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. After a long day of walking to see all the sites of San Francisco, concierge Richard made an excellent dinner recommendation for two travelers who wanted something casual, close-by, and somewhat authentic to California. We liked how close the hotel was to Embarcardero Center - especially since we had an 8:30 departure to Napa from the ferry building on Saturday. If we hadn't been on the tour, it would have been lovely to visit the weekend farmer's market that was there. We didn't find that its location in the financial district made it difficult to eat or explore, San Francisco is a very walkable city with nice public transportation. Plus, the doorman/valet has a car that will take you anywhere you want to go nearby.The rooms are also nice, although you would expect as much for the price of the room. As other travelers have noted, the double beds are small and make for cozy arrangements. Unfortunately, our view was not of the city but of an office building. =( Nothing special for a hotel of this caliber, but they are well-maintatined, clean, and of a good size.A note on parking: it's expensive (but I'm guessing that's everywhere in San Fran?). We parked across the street at the Embarcadero Center for $30 / night which was about $10 cheaper than the hotel and more accessible.Oh, and one more thing. We found the elevator music extremely amusing the first time, annoying thereafter.

<Content>Loved Le Meridien I arrived at Le Meridien on a Friday around 3:30 but my room wasn't ready. They said they would find something else at the same rate or I could wait - I opted for getting a room right away. Stayed on the 16th floor with a partial bay view of the Oakland Bridge, also overlooking the Embarcadero walkways all the way to the Ferry Building- really lovely.As for our room, it was spacious, fairly clean and well kept. There was a fan in the bathroom that ran all night so I just closed the door and then it didn't bother me at all. There was lots of street noise (garbage pick-up, construction????) on the Friday night but nothing Sat or Sun nights. Being in the Finanaical district, I loved that it was very quiet on the street over the weekend. They play some weird music in the elevators though.There was a Starbuck's across the street, open all weekend. There's no coffee facilities in the room but you can get free coffee/tea in the lobby on the weekend mornings in go cups.Room service was prompt, within the 30 minutes as promised, food was quite hot and very attractively presented. Only problem was the pepper shaker was empty but that's a very small gripe. The Chocolate Cloud cake was really good, so was the Ceasar salad and fresh bread. The ravioli was also good and very colourful. They gave me a huge pot of tea-the Lavender Earl Grey tea is gorgeous.Bellmen, maids, concierege were all really friendly, helpful and talkative - a pleasure to deal with. (There was a lady on the front desk on the Monday morning who was a bit uppity when I asked about a secure place to store my computer and luggage before going to the airport.) William the concierege was lovely to deal with. When he made reservations at Neptune's Palace, Fisherman's Wharf for dinner he ordered a complimentary seafood appetizer plate for us which was a very lovely surprise! The other concierege (blond lady) was hugely helpful too, made reservations at Cliff House and told me where to find the closest Ann Taylor store (much to my husband's chagrin).We were there for a long weekend and did the Bay tour and the 3.5 hour City Tour. Bought those in combination for $51 US for both at Blue and Gold Fleet. A great deal to get an overview of the City and Bay!Be warned, summer there is freezing! It was mid-fifties the whole time, foggy, very windy and often rainy. Glad I had a jean jacket but I still bought a fleecy rain jacket with a hood for $20 - it was totally worth it. Lots of cheap sweatshirts/jackets at Fisherman's Wharf.I have to say that the taxis were flithy. We took several taxis to get around and all of them were dirty but a couple of them were truly disgusting. We found it best to order a taxi ahead of time with the restaurant concierege if possible. We were able to find a taxi Sat night at Fisherman's Wharf just before the stores closed with no trouble but at closing time on Thurs. night, there was a long lineup of cranky people waiting for the few cabs that would drop by.If you're walking from the Ferry Building to Fisherman's Wharf, be warned that it's a long walk (30 min) but pleasant. However there are no bathrooms between the two areas so go before you leave! There's really nowhere to get food in between either.Fisherman's Wharf was interesting to see as I've heard about it for so many years on tv, movies, etc. Very touristy, but some good eating places and some fun souvenir shops. The sea lions are smelly and noisy but interesting to see.Hotel was within an easy 15 min walking distance to Union Square - where all those awesome, expensive shops are (Tiffany's, Vuitton, cartier, etc.). The Ferry Building was about a 7 minute walk along the Emarcadero (more shops!). Lots of street entertainment around there and incredibly fresh food at the weekend farmer's market.Whenever we saw a trolley or cable car or bus, they were all jammed to the gills so we didn't bother to go on there.I would certainly recommend Le Meridien and would stay there again.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location Yes, it is a business hotel, but it is nice, clean, and, if you are in the right room, has excellent views. Apparently, any room that ends in 12 is a corner room that faces the Oakland bridge and is much larger than the other. When we checked in we were given a #12 room and loved it, but the room came with two double beds. We asked to look at one with a king size bed and it was much smaller and not nearly as nice....needless to say, we snuggled up and took the view!There really isn't a restaurant on property, but this is San Francisco!!--Who needs one in the hotel when you are surrounded by some of the best food in the country?The concierges were excellent and provided terrific recommendations and really seem to treat all guests well. All in all, a great place.

<Content>awesome service, gorgeous rooms We stayed at Le Meridien while celebrating an anniversary, and it was a good thing I let the hotel staff know that, because they went all out. After we got back from a nice dinner, we discovered they had left us a free bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and a nice card congratulating us on the occasion. They had even turned on music for us. That aside, the room was large, beautiful (I do like modern decor) and had a great view. I especially liked the bathroom and the bath products. The location is more financial district than downtown, but we had a car, so it was fine for us.

<Content>Great location served to you with a smile... My trip to San Francisco was a last minute impulse and in doing so not all of the necessities of basic travel made it in my suitcase. A trip to the concierge desk gave me the toiletries I needed along with a wonderful suggestion for a great place for a burger. (Taylor鈥檚-inside the Ferry Building-You must get the Wisconsin sourdough)From the front desk to housekeeping everyone was eager to provide a first class experience. Each time I would pass an employee in the hotel they greeted you with eye contact and a friendly hello. Seems that most places you go you may get a few to serve you with a smile but when the entire staff has a smile you realize that they are doing something right. Staff treated me like a local and not a tourist which made me feel I was getting the inside track on things to do in the city without the other fanny packers.Conveniently located in the financial district you are close to all the fun without the noise that comes with a big city. The rooms are clean and comfortable with big windows to enjoy the sights of the city. The restaurant serves a grand breakfast so wakeup ready to enjoy a relaxing meal.

<Content>Great Location, A Little Pricey, Clean We usually stay at the Argent, but it was booked so we cashed in some points and stayed here. I thought I liked the location of the Argent, but in retrospect, this is an even better location.The mall is right next door + the BART is within a 5 minute walk. It's a great location - minutes from the Embarcadero - and on the weekend, we walked over and did some shopping at the farmers market.The rooms are clean and being the heart of the financial district, the sidewalk traffic really clears out after 6pm and on weekends.Would highly recommend it!

<Content>GREAT location!!! GREAT service!!! GREAT hotel!!! We stayed at Le Meridien for 3 nights in early July. We booked on Hotwire.com for $149 Saturday and $119 Sunday and Monday for a 4.5 star hotel in the Embarcedero District. The hotel is in the financial district so there isn't much going on right out the door of the hotel on Saturday or Sunday, but we found the location perfect for walking to Fisherman's Wharf, North Beach - the Italian sector, Union Square, and Chinatown. The BART and the MUNI are just a short walk and the cable cars are right outside the door. The concierge service recommended some great restaurants within walking distance and got us in on a Saturday night no problem. The hotel was clean and comfortable with a well-stocked minibar and good showers.

<Content>Go Elsewhere Unless You Like Noise and Bad Attitude There are two big problems with this hotel: bad attitude from the staff and noise. I booked a lengthy trip, and when I checked in the front desk manager said that there were only 2 rooms available: one right next to the elevator and at the corner of two busy streets, and the other right next to the electrical equipment room, where you hear the elevator rumbling by constantly. The next morning, the day desk manager said there were many vacancies and moved me to a room where I could hear the constant rumbling of the subway. I'm not kidding. Then he told me that for the rate I paid, that was it--despite the fact that entire floors were shuttered because business is slow. Well, it's no wonder that business is slow. My request to speak with the General Manager was ignored. Who needs this type of treatment when you're trying to enjoy your vacation. Do yourself a big favor. I've traveled to SF many times, and you can find many better places to stay. I got a very good price on my reservation--but there's no such thing as a free lunch.

<Content>Snazzy Hotel. Well worth the money. We went to San Francisco for a friend's birthday so we decided to live it up through Hotwire. Le Meridian was somewhat difficult to find off the Bart stop even with the directions. I called ahead and the staff was nice enough to give us an early check-in and gave us a room on the higher floors which have a much better view. We could see the bay out our window. I have this preconceived notion that when you buy something off a discount website that you are going to discount service but that wasn't the case here. Everyone was nice and the Bell Hops were pretty hilarious. The hotel is located downtown so if your there on a Sunday, nothing is really open. All the restaurants and bars close early but it鈥檚 a short walk to Little Italy or Chinatown and they stay open pretty late down there. There is an Irish Bar across the street that is about the only thing open after 9pm. We didn't attempt the hotel restaurant though. Good location and pretty accessible to mass transit for the touristy stuff. Rooms were gorgeous and the bathroom was also pretty ornate. They even gave out robs to enjoy during your stay which was a nice addition. Definitely would recommend.

<Content>Great stay at Le Meridien SF I visited Le Meridien for a long weekend, 6/21 - 6/24 and found that my expectations of the hotel were fully met.After a long flight from New York we chose to take a taxi from SF International Airport at a cost of $35.00 for the 20 minute car ride to the Financial Center, where Le Meridien is located. As previously mentioned, the BART train does stop nearby somewhere along adjacent The Embarcadero Center.Check-in was fast and courteous.We booked a Studio Room, #1906, which had great views of the bay and the city, a separate sitting area separated by a large TV credenza, and the most comfortable bed I've slept in, other than my own Temperputic mattress. Bathroom was spacious, with good basic ammenities, a separate tub, and shower. Room was kept very clean, although turn-down service only happened one night.We chose to go out to eat for every meal, except for in-room breakfast our first morning. Service was prompt and accurate, and food was good; all at the usual elevated hotel prices.San Francisco is a city easy to navigate, partly because it's only 7 x 7 miles (hence the San Francisco 49ers!), and we found that Le Meridien was centrally located for either walking (which we love), taking one of the electric-powered buses, grabbing a cab, or even the Trolley.Everyone at the hotel was friendly, and courteous, specially Angela @ Conceirge services. She was always pleasantly helpful with reservations and directions, and even helped us rent a car for a great day out in Sausalito and Muir Woods.All in all, I was very happy with my stay at the Le Meridien San Francisco, and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Le Meridien Rocks! It was tough deciding where to stay in San Francisco, but my husband and I were extremely happy with our decision with Le Meridien. We let the front desk know that we were on our anniversary trip along with the fact that it was our first time away from our 2 year old. The lady at the front said that she had a great room for us. When we got to our room, we were on the 17th floor and ended up with a suite! The room was gorgeous. That evening when we got back to our room, we had a bottle of champagne and cheese and crackers. This hotel was in a great location for us and wasn't overcrowded. The area is pretty quiet on the weekends, but we were okay with that. The hotel is close to the Ferry Building and if you are going to be around for the weekend, check out the Farmer's Market - it was awesome!

<Content>Every room's a corner room We booked through the hotel website, and found a good rate (AAA -- $267 per night) for their bay view king, for 6 nights.Check-in was the fastest I'd ever experienced at any hotel.Our room was immaculate, and the view of the bay (from our 19th floorroom) was spectacular. The somewhat unusual footprint of the building(with stellate margins) gives every room the impression that it is a corner room. The room was quiet, despite the presence of other guestson both sides of us (as evidenced by their private tags on the doors).The bed was very comfy (I think it was one of those bowling ball mattresses). There was plenty of storage space for two people, and we appreciated that the television was hidden in the cabinet when not in use. The bathroom was spacious, and had the usual amenities one would expect from a hotel of this price point. Surprisingly, there was also a bathroom scale, which yielded somewhat disconcertingresults after almost a week of (too) good eating in San Francisco.Our only deficiency, a very minor one, was that there was just one bathrobe in the room, even though we had made the reservation for two occupants. This oversight was corrected promptly.Breakfast was included in our package, and, with the supplied coupon,one could order anything off their extensive breakfast menu (up to a value of $31 per person -- the unused portion of the coupon going to the servers as tip). The food was very good, but we wouldn't have eaten here if it wasn't included. It's quite pricey.The is free coffee/tea in the lobby lounge every morning until 9 am.The hotel is centrally located, just across the street from the Embarcadero center, and a few minutes walk from the Muni/BART station. In less than 15 minutes walk, one can get to the Ferry Building and both North Beach and Chinatown. Several different city buses also pick up right around the hotel. Interestingly, the room key gains admittance to the Yerba Buena art gallery, as the hotel has some sort of partnership with it.We checked out the fitness centre downstairs, and found it to be wellequipped (free weights and machines), with a supply of water andtowels.We had a very pleasant stay at this hotel, and would definitely come again, particularly if we were able to match our rate again.

<Content>Hotel restaurant always closed for dinner This is a great hotel, but I have to say that closing the hotel restaurant for dinner each night substantially reduces the value of this hotel, in my view. I don't feel like walking around the city's financial district with business associates trying to find a quiet restaurant after a long and tedious working day. I was told by the hotel staff that I could eat in the bar, but who in the heck wants to have a nice meal in the bar? At a hotel of this caliber and price, I would expect full service. It is not, and I will not go back.

<Content>great hotel Based on the reviews posted on both tripadvisor and expedia, I booked 2 rooms at Le Meridian for 3 nights during the memorial day weekend. Both rooms are quite clean and spacious. My parents鈥?room was at the corner, which is larger and has a great bay view whereas ours doesn鈥檛 have any views. And indeed, the beds are super comfortable. One night, when my husband tried to close the sliding door in our room, the door got stuck. Only moment after he called the help desk, the maintenance person came to help and it only took few minutes for him to fix the door. We were very impressed. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay, the staffs were very courtesy and attentive. I will definitely return to this hotel if I need to stay in the same area next time. (Speaking of parking, since it was long weekend, we were able to park our cars on the street for two nights free.)

It was conveniently located across the street from my office yet seemed to exude much more personality than most of your standard business hotels. The view from my corner room was simply wonderful. My room included the bedroom area as well as a separate office, two points of egress to the balcony and a very, very well appointed bathroom. I indicated to the concierge that I only had a small amount of time to enjoy the immediate area, and they went out of their way to arrange transportation around the city and then to two fantastic restaurants, one for lunch and one for dinner. Excellent. Note that I have usually stayed at the Four Seasons in the past and I enjoyed my room and the service at Le Meridien much, much more. I look forward to visiting SF again soon (one of my favorite cities in the world) and returning to Le Meridien.

<Content>Fantabulous Staff This hotel has the customer service thing down!!!! The hotel staff was absolutely amazing!!!Location of hotel very good. Having lived in New York City for 15 years, it was amusing to hear the staff talk of long walks as 7 blocks or more.We had a a large room on the top floor with a city view and a parital view of the Bay Bridge along with a small patio. Great for a late day drink after a long day of sightseeing. The bed was so comfortable my husband wanted to figure out a way to bring it home along with the down comforter, and at least 300 thread count sheets. My 76 year old mother in law had a room 2 floors below and her view was even more amazing. She had a bay view with a spectacular, up close and personal, view of the Transamerica building.When we arrived it was raining slightly and we asked Kristen, I hope I remember her name, dark hair extremely polite and pleaseant, if she knew where the nearest drug store was because we wanted to buy an umbrella, she happily provided us one from the hotel and asked if we would mind, because the name of the hotel was on it. If it's free, it for me darling,!!! We walked to Fisherman's Wharf had dinner and walked back and upon return Kristen told us to keep it because it looked like rain in the morning.. My mother in law asked if there was a microwave on her floor and one was brought to her room immediately the same for a request for a stronger hair dryer.I slightly sprained my ankle doing the sightseeing thing, those nasty San Francisco hills, and when I returned, I asked the concierge, Laura, I believe, if the hotel had an ice bag. She provided a laundry bag for ice, and said she would call the room once she checked thorougly. About 20 minutes later I received a call in my room from Laura apologizing for there not being one in the hotel and asking if she needed to contact a physician.I know these seem like small things, but I have found that it is usually the small things that can make or break a hotel stay. Unreceptive, stiff staff do little to recommend a hotel, however, Le Meriden should be very proud of the people I came in contact with. I hope everyone who chooses to stay here has at least some contact with the people I mentioned and I am assured that there stay will be as wonderful!!!

<Content>Great business hotel in SF I stayed in this hotel numerous times when it was the Park Hyatt, in the summer of 2005, while I was on a consulting project. I loved it - understated, quiet, great service, friendly staff and convenient location made it a perfect base. I returned again and again. Hopefully the staff and style have not changed with new ownership. The views from the north facing, upper floors are wonderful on summer mornings. If you like morning exercise, the fitness room is good and the location allows morning runs along the Embarcardero.

<Content>Horrible staff We came down to San Francisco to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary and decided to stay at your establishment. We have long been loyal customers of the Starwood Brand and have decided to try Le Meridien. Needless to say, we were greatly disappointed. Upon arrival to the hotel, we were greeted with a valet, when my husband inquired as to where the cars were parked, he was informed that the parking was 5 blocks away. Understandable, but when my husband inquired if it was secured, the parking attendant rudely replied, this is San Francisco, what do you think? We had no issues with the parking, as our concern was the shopping bags in the back of the car. Okay... the valet was rude, but we decided it would not ruin our stay. Upon check in we discovered that the room with the king sized bed that we had requested was unavailable and that we would be in a room with 2 double beds...that too was fine as we were both tired and my husband was beginning to have a headache. Later that evening, my husband's headache was beginning to get worse and so I decided to call the operator to see if there was any Tylenol on the premises that we could purchase and was advised that the concierge would have some. However when I called, I was informed by the concierge that she was incredibly busy and she cannot deal with me right now as she put it , as she had several people in front of her. Now we have stayed in hundreds of 5 star hotels in cities around the world and NEVER in my experience have I been spoken to by a hotel staff so rudely. Needless to say, it was getting late that evening and my husband and I decided to retire for the evening. However, that would not be the case- at 3 am in the morning we were woken up by the sounds of what sounded like people having a party in the next room. We called down twice and were informed that the noise would be taken care of, we even requested to switch rooms, but we were assured by the management that the noise would be taken care of, but that was not the case as it continued on until 6 in the morning as the noise would die down shortly after being told, and then start again. My husband and I did not sleep that evening. We decided to check out early and when asked by the woman how was everything, we told her about our dis-satisfaction and she basically just nodded and proceeded with checking us out. Which makes me wonder if she is just required to ask, but obviously does not care about the satisfaction of the customer as she failed to offer solutions. When our car arrived , from valet we discovered that the window had been left open all night as there was bird feces inside our car, something that would result in my husband having to take the car professionally cleaned later that day.

<Content>One of the best hotels in San Francisco This hotel has the most comfortable beds I've ever experienced at a hotel. It is a beautiful property. The rooms are very spacious. We had an excellent view of coit tower and the water. Room 2411 has a skyline view - ask for it! They have special touches such as giving you the weather report everyevening for the next day, leaving fortune cookies in your room, turn down your sheets, provide many blankets and extra pillows. Additionally, the concierge there is very helpful. The location is good, just a few blocks from the Embarcadero Ferry Building, which by the way has excellent food markets and restaurants. This hotel is always clean and quiet, perhaps that is because it isn't located by tourist zones. This is my favorite place to stay in San Francisco.

<Content>excellent beds and very well equipped gym Unsurprisingly, Le Meridien provides the expected comfortable mattress I've come to expect from Starwood. For San Francisco, the rooms were reasonably spacious with the usual desk and office chair. I especially enjoyed using their gym and worked out 3 times during my stay. The gym has multiple elliptical trainers, weight machines and free weights as well as complimentary water and fruits. Although I didn't utilize it, Le Meridien offers complimentary same-day laundering of work-out clothes (in by 9am, ready by 5pm). The staff were exceedingly friendly and helpful the few times I needed anything. Le Meridien provides a complimentary business center, which I used many times. Only once did I have to wait to use the business center, so I didn't pay for internet access in the room. Overall, I felt quite pleased with my stay and would stay there again.

<Content>Room For Improvement The only positive thing about this hotel was the bed - big and comfortable. The front desk staff were rather poorly behaved and not particularly helpful. Beware business travellers - if you need a quiet place to stay, this isn't it. The hotel is facing the street and the walls are paper thin, so you can hear your neighbours all the time - walking, talking, singing, etc. The rooms do not include complementary water which is inconvenient to say the least, showers are average, the list goes on. I would have prefered to spend extra $$ and stay at the Ritz which is what I will do next time. This place simply does not warrante $300+ spend on a suite.

<Content>Return Visit Did Not Dissapoint This is our second stay at this location and once again, it was wonderful! As an SPG Gold Member, they accomodated my request for an upgrade and treated us like Gold while we were there! From the front desk to the concierge to housekeeping, everyone was extremely polite and made us feel so welcome and well cared for. While I typically like to stay closer to Union Square, the service and ameneties make the Le Meridien worth sacrificing a little more convenient location. Thank you to the staff and keep up the good work! I will only stay here or the St. Regis when in the bay area from now on!

<Content>Wonderful Experience My family and I stayed at the Le Meridian formerly the Park Hyatt in Embarcadero Center the week of New Years. Our room was very spacious and had a terrific view of the San Francisco skyline. The bathroom was floor to ceiling granite including the shower. The room was extremely comfortable and clean. The beds were very comfortable with down comforters and we actually slept good, something that usually doesn't happen for us in hotels because of the beds. The service in the hotel was phenomenal all around. The front desk staff was very accomodating. My husband had business faxed to the hotel and everytime his faxes came thru the front desk was right on top of everything with the delivery of things. The conceirge was the best!! They were so friendly and they listened to our interests and then pointed us in the direction of what our interests were. Everything they suggested was fantastic! My husband and I used the gym every morning. It was very pleasant to work out in. They provide chilled towels with a scent of mint to refresh after our work out. The amenities in the gym were very inviting. The only downside of staying in this hotel if you have a car is the parking fee. The fee is $50.00 per day. Since it is a business district there are plenty of parking garages that are cheaper, however, after researching it more we opted to pay the hotel fee everyday because we knew we could easily get our car out anytime without walking with 2 young children to a garage. Whenever we did need our car a simple phone call downstairs did the trick and they were always ontime with our car. Although if you don't have young children in tow it's probably worth it to park in a public garage and pay half the price. Across the street is a pub type restaurant that serves great food!! The breakfast is delicious and is way cheaper than room service. We even got breakfast to go one day and let the kids eat in bed without the room service price. This hotel is centrally located within walking distance to lots of things to see and do in San Francisco. We walked to the cable cars to go to China Town and walked back from China Town. We did a lot of walking and saw alot of sights. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone that craves great service and ammenities.

<Content>Super rooms and great location Le Meridien was the kind of five-star hotel that's comfortable, because it still feels nice and home-y and not clinical and unfriendly.The lobby is very small, the bar is really just a few tables. The Park Grill, which is the hotel's restaurant served okay breakfast, it was nothing special. Service was a bit slow, but the staff was very kind. Room service was fast and efficient.In fact, everybody from the cleaning staff to the people manning the desks were really friendly and professional. The concierge was of great help reserving restaurants and booking us the complimentary town car! I haven't had this in any other hotel. There's a free car with a driver that will drive you anywhere you want in the downtown area or thereof. We even got a ride back from our restaurant as we gave him a call. Sadly, the service is not available on weekends, but it's a really great feature of hotel.I stayed in a regular double room and it was great. The beds are massive and very comfy. The toilet is nice and big enough with a separate desk for toiletries, magazines etc. There's plenty of storage space too for everything.For once the wireless internet connection worked without a hitch as did the regular one and the speed was great.The hotel's location is superb. It's in a quiet neighborhood in Embarcadero, with a movie theatre across the street and a Starbucks too. A few blocks away is Chinatown, so North Beach clubs and restaurants are a walking distance. Downtown (ie. Union Square) is also about 5 blocks away, easily walkable. I've stayed in San Francisco many times and location-wise, it's tough to beat the Meridien.

<Content>Le Meridien Shines!! Reservations: Got a great rate using Travelocity with a AAA discount which got us free parking (N.B.: valet parking is $52 per night!!).Check-in  Check-out: Polite, efficient, fast, and accurate.Room: great beds, furniture, and bathrooms, with great linens, towels, and bath products. The room and the bathroom were spacious and very well maintained. Had a partial view of the SF Bay and Bay Bridge.Additional Services: excellent concierge service; free internet in the lobby and the business center. The hotel gym was the BEST I have experienced in a long time; free weights, machines, and an excellent array of cardio equipment, plus newspapers, water, oranges, and apples.Location: easy walk to the waterfront and the Embarcadero. Some restaurants nearby, but you really need a car to get to a lot of the places you want to go. Short drive to Union Square, Chinatown, and SOMA. Close to the SF Museum of Modern Art and Yerba Buena Center.Complaint: valet parking was a little slow in fetching the car on occasion.Overall: A WINNER!!!!!

<Content>Great location We stayed at the Le Meridien right after they took over from the Park Hyatt so things were still a bit chaotic-everything still said Hyatt. Despite that the service was great, the room was luxurious and we had a great time. The rooms are slightly masculine in feel. The room service was particularly good. The location is great right near the Embarcadero with the ferry building and all the shops. Very easy to walk to restaurants, even to walk to North Beach. This hotel is very quiet and convenient. We will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Soothing business hotel I last stayed at this hotel when it was a Park Hyatt. I remembered that the stress of even the most hectic business trip melted away once I entered the Asian-theme lobby. Even though this was a vacation trip, I decided to go back to see whether the magic had survived the change in management, and I can report that it has.The soothing lobby decor remains (though what's with the disorienting art installation that extends to the panels of the revolving doors?). The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. The business center hidden behind the concierge desk was well-equipped and quiet.Our room -- with a partial view of the Bay -- was on the small side, but it was extremely comfortable and noise free. Only flaw -- particularly jarring in the otherwise well-tended setting -- was a light that didn't work.And the location can't be beat. Easy to take a quick stroll along the waterfront to calm jet-lagged nerves, and just a stone's throw from the food paradise that is the Ferry Building.It's a business hotel, but a very soothing one.

<Content>Absolutely Top Notch Le Meridien in San Francisco is a great place to stay. The rooms in the hotel are fantastic. My girlfriend and I especially enjoyed the comfortable beds. The service at check-in and the conceriege were top notch, recommending some great restaurants and even providing personal contact with some of the nearby restaurant owners. The hotel is located within a few blocks of the Ferry Builiding which is a great place to spend the day or just to grab breakfast. The location is also within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown. The hotel also has a complimentary car for guest use with prior reservation. This is a great program to shuttle to and from dinner if the car is available. From the rooms to the location, Le Meridien is a great place to stay in a great city.

<Content>Great Stay We stayed at Le Meridien for 4 nights, from Jan. 3 to Jan. 7, 2007, and had a wonderful stay. We booked a standard room, which had 2 double beds. The room was spacious and well laid out. Because the hotel is new, the room's furnishings were nice and new (which is always pleasant). The bathroom was fabulous (marble, super clean, large, great water pressure in the shower and good soap). But, what really set Le Meridien apart were the concierges. They booked us into some of SF's best, most difficult to get into restaurants on very short notice and, when we went to Micheal Mina, sent us to the restaurant in a chauffured car, at no charge. Plus, making a reservation for us meant making a reservation for 2 adults, 1 child and 1 infant - i.e., a table for 4 where only 2 diners will be ordered! I would not hesitate to recommend Le Meridien and want to stay there again.

The bed was very comfortable, although not as comfortable as the one at the W and Westin Hotels. This being a Starwood Hotel I expected it to be the same. The service was top notch, comparable to what you would experience at a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons. Overall a fantastic stay.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great rooms, great location We spent 3 nights at Le Meridien in San Francisco in October 2006. It is a beautiful hotel with great service, huge rooms, and in a very good location. Our room was very spacious with a king bed, 2 upholstered chairs, a side table, large desk and desk chair, and large armoire with minibar, drawer space, and a large TV. The closet was huge and out of the way. The bathroom was VERY large, newly refinished with a marble tile and vanity, lots of mirrors, and a great shower with massage and hand-held options. The toiletries were luxurious and the towels and robe were a soft, fluffy treat!The service was excellent, and everyone was very pleasant. Two staff at the concierge desk all weekend, just there to cater to our needs. They knew everything, had great advice, lots of maps and brochures. Very knowledgable and pleasant. We paid about $120/night through Hotwire, which was an incredible deal. The staff never made us feel funny or unwelcome despite our low internet rate (I've heard people report this about other hotels in the past). The concierge didn't look down on us when we asked about cheap, touristy things like bus routes, and treated us like any other customer there.Restaurant and room service are incredibly expensive - $65 for breakfast for two, which was delicious, but nothing extravagent. Starbucks is across the street, and the bar across the street also sells a good breakfast at a much more reasonable price.The hotel is across the street from the Embarcadero Center, a business district with lots of shops, fast food, cafes, etc. Two Walgreens are blocks away. Chinatown is about 5 blocks up the street, the Ferry Building is a few blocks the other way. North Beach begins a few blocks away, too. A wonderful location!My only criticism of this hotel is the odd bathroom door - on a runner, like a closet door, so it doesn't close tightly. The bathroom door always has a gap open. Not a good thing if you want some true privacy in the bathroom!

<Content>High priced but delivers (mostly) Great room, great (though narrow) view of bay  Ferry Bldg, easy access to Saturday morning farmers market, and an amazing array of fresh stuff. The place is expensive, but for the location, view, and service -- worth the splurge. Parking is a rip at $49 (tax included). Didn't check the fitness facilities: who cares when you're splurging? Get your exercise walking to City Lights bookstore, Brandy Ho's Chinese food, or along the Embarcedero after glutting at Cowgirl Creamery and the bread shops inside the Ferry Bldg.

<Content>Pricey, but worth it! This hotel used to be the Hyatt on Battery and was recently purchased by Le Meridien. I have stayed at the hotel several times and love it. The bed linens are luxurious, the rooms are always clean, and the views are great. I think that the price is a tad high, but the quality of the gym, rooms, and location makes it worth every penny. Best hotel gym that I have seen in an SF hotel. This hotel is central to the Financial district which makes it perfect for business trips. This is my first choice for all business trips in SF.

<Content>Very Impressive... Most of my recent stays in SF have been at the Mark Hopkins, but after my last, very disappointing stay there, I decided to try the much hyped, new Le Meridien (formally the Hyatt). I've previously preferred being closer to Union Square, however, on recent visits to the City, I discovered The Ferry Building, and can honestly say that I'd much rather be within walking distance to it (I can literally spend a day there!). There's also the Embarcadero right next to the hotel, so there's no lack of nice shopping choices in the immediate vicinity.The hotel itself is gorgeous. Not in a grand, over the top way, but very simple and elegant. Nice art deco decor throughout the lobby and bar(s). My room was a fabulous surprise. I booked a studio room, but was shocked when I entered and realized it was much more like a suite. There were 2 separate rooms (living, and bedroom) and a nice sized bathroom with gorgeous fixtures. The best part was the small terrace which gave way to both bay and city views. It was quite impressive! The only negative thing I could point out on the room was the fact that there was a shower/tub combo in the bathroom, which seemed really out of place in such a nice, modern space.The hotel service was flawless. Granted, I didn't ask for anything unusual, but everyone I encountered was friendly and polite.I used the small, but functional gym. Nothing impressive there, but still, it was clean and had new equipment.Bottom line... This is where I'll stay from now on.

<Content>Good location; nice hotel Located in the financial district, this hotel is well within walking distance of the SOMA area (SF MOMA, Yerba Buena, etc.) and the Ferry building, a great place to spend a weekend morning/early afternoon perusing the farmer's market. It's only a short drive or cab ride to Nob Hill and the pier from which the ferry for Alcatraz leaves. The public areas of the hotel are rather cramped and pretty average.Our room had a nice view to the bay--it is probably worth paying the extra $20 or so for the views. The rooms are really quite spacious and very clean, with very comfortable beds and a nice sized closet. The TV sits a bit too low in the entertainment stand, but it all works well nonetheless. There is a nice Nakamachi stereo system that sits on top of the entertainment stand. The bathroom had a tub/shower combination and Le Meridien brand toiletries. I would say that, on balance, the rooms are very comfortable, though they could perhaps use a little freshening up--maybe new furniture, or at least, new coverings for the sofa and armchair. We ate breakfast at the hotel--we got it free as part of the deal--and it was excellent, though of course, would have been outrageously expensive had we paid. The breakfast/dining area--the Park Grill--is quite nice, with a little outdoor terrace and plenty of space between tables.There is nothing about this hotel that makes it an absolute standout, but for the money--we paid 199, all in--you would be hard pressed to find a better option.

<Content>Made our stay We stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel upgraded us to a junior suite on the 23rd floor overlooking the bay. Needless to say, the room was impressive: great bath amenities, nicely appointed suite, and an impeccable service to match. On our last night, the front desk sent up a bottle of champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries, very toughtful and a nice touch. The hotel was centrally located, walking distance to restaurants, Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, etc. Since the hotel is in the business district, parking is expensive. There is also no pool and wireless internet (cable still available). Overall, this is a great property and staff were quick to help with smiles all around.

<Content>Nice hotel, wonderful views at the top floors I stayed three nights at Le Meridien San Francisco in August. The room was beautiful, wide and with a grat bed. The staff was very nice and helpful. They gave me a room on the 22nd floor, with a nice view over the downtown and the bay.The hotel is located in the downtown, near Jackson. Nice place to stay with lot of restaurants around and just a few blocks walking from Chinatown. Just one objection: the parking was veryexpensive (49$ per night). Anyway, you have a public parking in the next building with a 28$ daily price.

<Content>Great rooms, great beds, great time! We stayed at Le Meridien for my wife's birthday and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Located close to Jackson Square, Le Meridien is walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square and the Ferry Building (great farmer's market on the weekend). The rooms were large and very clean and looked renovated within the last two years with the bed very comfortable. Water pressure was excellent and we had both a bathtub and a shower to choose from in the large bathroom (bay view room of the Bay Bridge). We also enjoyed a great breakfast in the morning in bed. We could not have been happier with our experience and will definitely be back on our next trip to SF.

<Content>Beautiful Property with Some Service Issues I selected Le Meridien for a romantic weekend in San Francisco for my wife's birthday after finding an excellent rate at the hotel's website.When I checked in at reception and mentioned that it was my wife's birthday, they were nice enough to upgrade us to a large corner room with a spectacular view of the bay. Unfortunately, the key cards they provided did not work. Neither did the second set, or the third, or the fourth. Each department was blaming another for the problem with the keys, as if I cared why the keys were not working. Eventually security let us into our room. When I left the hotel for the afternoon, I was assured that engineering had resolved the issue and the next set of keys would work. Unfortunately, they did not. The security guard who let us in the next time told us that he was surprised that they are still using this room, as the electronic lock had not worked properly for several weeks. After an immediate call to the manager, we were offered free cocktails and free breakfast for our inconvenience, which I felt was an adequate, albeit overdue, response from the supposed 5 star hotel.Other than this service (and maintenance) glitch, everything was fantastic. The entire property was modern and tastefully furnished and very clean. I hope to give them another opportunity demonstrate how nice this hotel can be.

<Content>Great Stay We were on trip starting in San Francisco driving down the PCH to San Diego staying in 7 hotels in 10 days. Our experience at the Le Meridien on August 4-6, 2006 couldn't have been better. We were given a great room with a view of Coit Tower, etc...The house car was also available to take  pick us up from a Giants game on Fri. night. Everyone at the hotel was most helpful. I liked being within walking distance to the Ferry Building  shopping at the Embarcardero Center. You can walk over to the Ferry Bldg.  ride the F line over to Fishermans Wharf to eat at Bourdins  then take a cable car to union square to shop also. I had read to take a ferry ride to Saulsilito for lunch which was fun too. Don't miss out on the Golden Gate Bridge. I would defintely stay here again. It was a beautiful hotel  great location.........

<Content>Nice Property - Jaded Staff - Poorly Managed LeMeridien's around the world are renowned for their lovely appointed rooms, and this was no exception. Nice beds, nice linens, curtains, and contemporary bathrooms. But the staff, who are all former Park Hyatt employees, seem jaded about the recent take over. When I checked in, one young lady made a comment about not having a bellman because it's Meridien, and that we might not be used to the service. Also, when they saw that I booked on hotwire and got a discounted rate, they actually told me that I get whatever is left over, that's how it works. So they put me in a double room, which was no big deal at all, I just thought that it was inappropriate to imply that because I got a good rate and prepaid through hotwire that I would be treated differently. The service only got worse from there - the next night the 'acting manager' wouldn't allow me to take a bottle of alcohol into my room, citing it was a State of California law. Um, what? I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, and have NEVER heard of such a rule. I surrendered my bottle of alcohol, which they kept until I checked out. The night before check out, I called to get a wake up call for 4AM, and asked them to bring me my bottle of alcohol - she said that the note said that they weren't allowed to, under any circumstances. I know some people are reading this thinking I must have been a rowdy guest or an impossible to please person, but that is not the case, I am a physician, stayed in my room alone, and had no intention to consume the alcohol that was purchased in my room, in fact, I had already patronized the mini bar. Beautiful property people, however, don't let their poor management spoil your stay.

<Content>Great friendly service I stayed at Le Meridien for an outside meeting .It was an easy walk to the Ferry building. I loved the rooms .The extended hour concierges were extremely helpful.I had gone to St Regis (too much attitude) to check it out for a drink and I greatly prefer the service at the bar at Le Meridien .The service at the Le Meridien bar was great ,professional yet friendly.I realy enjoyed the view from my room of the bay bridge .My only comment is that the CD player in my room was glued to the counter and too high for me to read the dials . I will stay there again with my I pod

<Content>Just average This wasn't the five star experience I expected. There was no doorman or bellman when I arrived. There was only one person attending the registration desk and three guests in front of me, making for a wait to check in. I had reserved a King non-smoking. I deliberately did not reserve the double-double, which was 20 bucks less. Even though I checked in at thier check-in time - 3 p.m. - they said my room was not available without a long wait but they offered me a double double. But they wouldn't give me the lesser rate! It was ridiculous to stand there and argue with a line piling up behind me and an appointment to get to so I took the lesser room and the higher rate. What a sucker. I am going to follow up with the management. Any other hotel when this happens they either upgrade you or throw in a little something, not to mention correcting the rate. The room itself was fine. I was surprised that it was so small, and there was absolutely no view. It was clean and well furnished. I thought it was a little weird that the soaps were open (not wrapped up) making me think that maybe they were left from the previous stay. Nice bath amenities. The bathroom was large and really beautiful but a little dark. It helped that there was a lighted shaving mirror. The room was also pretty dark so I had to have all the lights on to see anything. The location was fine for me; walking distance to the various places I needed to be in the financial district. But I won't stay here again. One more thing -they were renovating the building across the street from my window. At ten oclock (midnight on the body clock) they began flinging large metal ducts from a fourth floor window into a dumpster below, reverberating throughout the alley. I called the front desk and they said that it was allowed until 11, that it happens every night, but they will stop at 11. They did.

<Content>Couldn't Be Better Visited the Le Meridien (formerly the Park Hyatt) over the Fourth of July weekend. Got a deal on the bay view room ($209 through Expedia). The room was on the 23rd floor. The view was amazing, from the Coit Tower and TransAmerica building to the Bay Bridge. The furnishings were good, the room was large, and the orange blossom-scented toiletries were delightful. More importantly, the hotel staff was friendly and helpful, greeting us with a smile everytime we passed by and offering to store our luggage when we arrived early and later, between check-out and the time our plane departed. I would highly recommend this hotel, which boasts a comparatively quiet location in the financial district.

<Content>Gem of a Hotel My husband and I stayed here for a quick weekend get away using our Starwood points. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our room on the 20th floor was clean, contemporary and spacious compared to the size of the room we stay in at the San Francisco W. We had a small but nice view of the Bay Bridge. Bring cd's so you can enjoy the room cd player. The toiletries were very nice. Very usable for both sexes. The bed was a sleeper's delight! The concierge was extremely helpful. The staff is attentive. We didn't eat at the hotel but enjoyed a nightcap in the hotel lobby after dinner. I highly suggest you have dinner at Jeanty at Jack's. It is one of our favorite (french) restaurants in the city. The tomato soup in puff pastry is a must! It is a leisurely stroll a couple of blocks from the hotel. Go to the Ferry Building for a light breakfast. There are a few places to buy coffee or tea, fruit, juice and a pastry. For lunch or dinner try the Slanted Door in the Ferry Building. North Beach and Chinatown are within walking distance, too. The next time we need another getaway, we'll stay here!

<Content>Great Hotel We've stayed at this hotel before when it was the Park Hyatt  loved it then. This past trip we had a junior suite - which was fabulous! It was a corner room facing the bay with a small balcony. The living room was separate from the bedroom, so we could entertain guests  share the great view! The decor is very modern - we had black  white marble/granite bathrooms, the doors are a cherry wood, and the carpet is dark. Robes were provided for us to use, as well as an umbrella just in case.... the bathroom amenities are great!We didn't dine in the hotel, but the concierge was excellent at making suggestions  confirming reservations. Little Italy is just a short walk, and for the more active, the Wharf is manageable as well. We'll definitely be back ... great location, great hotel  great prices if Travelzoo has a special.

<Content>Great experience at Le Meridien! Stayed here with my parents (2 different rooms) on a vacation in Northern California. The experience was great. I can't imagine a better place to stay in SF (unless you need a lot of nightlife). The staff were all outstandingly pleasant and helpful. The rooms were not just clean and comfortable--they were stylish! We had a great view of the bay (paid a small charge to upgrade). Easy to get to any place you like in SF, but really quiet and safe at night.I got a great deal on the hotel through Hotwire. Count yourself extremely lucky if you land something similar. But given my excellent experience, if I were travelling to SF again, I'd try to stretch my budget to make sure I could return here.

<Content>impeccable service, beautiful views Le Meridien, formerly Park Hyatt is a fantastic hotel where service is top priority. The rooms are beautifully appointed, great bath amenities, plenty of space, awesome views. I booked through hotwire so didn't know where I'd be for my in-town getaway, and I loved this hotel so much, I'm returning at the end of the month. The room service food is very good, however the menu is limited, could use some more choices. It's served perfectly, with all the little touches. Turndown service is excellent and the staff is really there to meet and exceed your expectations. The location is quiet at night and close to north beach, chinatown, ferry building, california street cable car, and union square. The bathroom was huge and gorgeous. You can't go wrong here.

<Content>Great hotel in need of renovation, not worth the current rates. I spend over 100 nights a year in hotels, and have spent several in this hotel. I'm sort of a hotel snob. If it were not for the free up grades I recieve at this property I would stay some where else. The service is good to excellent. The concierge desk, bar, and restaurant staff are fantastic, the front desk, bell stand, and housekeeping need some work. Druing the weekends the hotel and this area can be dead.The rooms are on the dark side, the one that face the city can be dark to gloomy with little or no sunlight. Bay view rooms have wonderful bay views and are much brighter. The decor in the room are on the dark side as well. Hyatt had replaced the carpet, wall paper and added new beds, but the rest of the furnishings are over 20 years old and its shows. The marble bathrooms are luxuious with nice amenities. The lobby bar and lobby need to be renovated, most of the 20 year old furniture shows it age. There is no pool, spa, jacuzzi, or even a restroom near the small gym. Most of the photos you see on the hotel web site are of the newly renovated penthouse suite not the guest rooms. This is a nice place to stay if you recieve the upgrades and services I get as a frenquent guest. But for the current rates I see posted I would stay some place else. There are several newer or renovated hotels in the city that offer more modern facilities, and services. Most of these hotels are around the same price range or are worth the extra buck. Le Merdian needs to do some major renovation to this property if it expects to keep offering the current high rates. Just a name change alone do not merrit an increase in rates, it's still the same old hotel in need of a face lift.
