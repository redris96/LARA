<Content>Good Choice in Manhattan Great stay at the Courtyard. Employees were friendly and helpful. Room was huge by Manhattan standards. Mini-fridge was handy. Location was pretty good, near subway, drug store, bagel shop. Free coffee and computers were available on the 12th floor. The only negatives were having to call for bedding for the sleeper sofa, and being unable to access my Internet service provider on the hotel computers.

<Content>New Year For a rather low price I booked this along with a flight. We stayed on a higher floor which was very quiet - even New Year's Eve! I have stayed in many Manhattan hotels and this location and size of room were among the best. They let us check in early, we had a clean and spacious room and the hotel staff could not have been friendlier. Will stay again. The only glitch was I was charged for parking and I had no vehicle.

<Content>Loved the Courtyard Midtown East We found this property to be more than expected. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Our room was spacious with 2 queen beds and a sofa bed. The beds and pillows were so comfortable. I don't believe I have ever slept so well away from home. The hotel is located at 3rd Ave and 53rd and only steps from the subway. We were within walking distance of Central Park. Rockefeller Center and the hustle and bustle of Times Square were only minutes away by taxi or subway. The location was clean and we felt safe at all hours day or night even on the subway. We highly recommend this hotel property and will defintely stay here again on our next trip to NY. Pleased in Texas.

<Content>Great hotel for the money.... Originally had booked a more expensive 4.5 star hotel at twice the price, but heard very good things about the Marriott Courtyards in NYC and we're glad we switched. Just a great experience for the price...it is still a Courtyard and you can't get too excited but the service, location, cleanliness and the great price (keeping in mind it is NYC at the Christmas / New Year holiday time) made it a hotel we're pleased to recommend and plan on staying there in the future.

<Content>great location, hotel is just ok Just got back from a one night stay at the Courtyard Midtown with husband and two teenagers. The good points are that the room size is large with 2 queens and a pull-out. Our room was on the 16th floor with no view. We looked at an office building out our small windows. The bathroom has a door which opens into the room on an automatic hinge so anytime you use it the door swings shut. I found that to be very annoying. The room was very quiet and the beds were comfortable. There is a tiny lobby area which is very crowded especially at check in because there is no place for luggage. I prefer the large spacious lobbies of other ny city hotels, not this cramped dark space. The concierge was not very helpful and did not give us a good restaurant recommendation so do your own research. We walked to everything but there is a subway one block away.There is a fabulous market called Azure at 51st and 3rd with every possible food choice you could ask for. They have seating on the 2nd floor or you can get it to go. The restaurant on the 12th floor is good for breakfast. I would probably stay somewhere else next time because this place lacks the glam factor which is why we go to New York.

<Content>Functional city centre hotel. Having read some to the previous reviews I was expecting more than this place delivered. It is a clean, functional, city centre hotel providing reasonable value for money. The place has no character or charm. The staff were curtious but nothing more. The location is great for exploring the city and the neighbourhood feels safe and secure.

<Content>A great trip and a great hotel Stayed at this hotel just after Thanksgiving this year and enjoyed the whole experience.Have been to New York several times and by far this is the best hotel i've had the good fortune to stay in. I know a lot of people say the hotel isnt a huge part of the holiday, but i for one like to come back from a busy day to somewhere that is warm, comfortable and i dont need to check for bugs!!!This hotel is a real gem, the rooms are large (especially for New York) with plenty of room for suitcases and shopping -i stayed with 3 friends and we still had loads of floorspace for more purchases.The staff were all very friendly and were very quick to come to our assistance when required - a very stubborn wine cork being dealt with with good humour!I would like to thank all of the staff for making this my best trip to Manhattan yet and i hope to see you all in the not too distant future!

<Content>Great location! I have stayed at this hotel a few times and it is a great location, for both business and personal travel. This is a typical Marriott Courtyard in that it doesn't have a full service restaurant or bar but it is surrounded by plenty of places to eat and room service is offered by Outback. The rooms are big for New York standards and the hotel is clean. There is a large drug store right next store and the hotel is in a great location for dining, shopping, walking, etc. The staff is great and, again, the location is PERFECT.

<Content>Super Covenient and Great Value For the price this hotel is great when visiting New York City - especially during the busy holiday season. It is ideally located near Rockefellar Center, Central Park and Times Square.The lobby is not one of the nicest Courtyard lobbies, although the rooms are very spacious for NYC. The staff was very helpful and the concierge helped get us to our ticketed venues in plenty of time.The hotel does not have a pool, although it does have a good fitness room. I'll look forward to using this hotel again when visiting NYC.

<Content>Great Family Christmas NYC Trip My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a Christmas holiday weekend with 4 young kids and 2 grandparents. The hotel is in a GREAT location to Radio City, Times Square and Rockfeller Center, etc. We walked to all of the sights with 4 kids under 6 years of age with little effort. The room was spacious for NYC standards and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We were able to check in early which was a huge plus. The parking was a little pricey and you could probably save finding a parking garage on your own but worth the convenience. I totally recommend this hotel to anyone planning a stay in NYC. We will be returning.

<Content>Superb location, great rooms Like others have reiterated, the location can't be beaten as the entrance to the subway is just steps away. Perfect place as a base for sightseeing or business. Rooms are spacious (had 2 queen beds to fit 2 adults  2 kids very comfortably), clean  well maintained. If you need a fridge, you can ask for a complimentary one at check-in. There's a 24 hour Duane Reed pharmacy to pick up necessities or simple breakfast stuff (like bread/cereals/water/milk/etc) just next door. Or a proper supermarket (Food Empire) abt 1 block away. A more expensive specialty grocery store is just round the corner. Lots of restaurants in the area (even McD's - for those with kids). Totally recommend the hotel.

<Content>Great Location, Decent Hotel I just returned from the Courtyard Marriott yesterday with my fianc茅 from a week-long business trip/class. The location of this hotel is phenomenal. If you don't have difficulty walking, you can easily walk to 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Central Park, etc., etc., etc. There are also plenty of restaurants and great delis in the area. I highly recommend the Oxford Deli for breakfast and lunch (ask the concierge for exact location).Since we stayed with a large group, our nightly rate was rather reasonable due to a group discount. Otherwise, I'm not sure if this place really is that good of a value. A few negatives that we noted:-tiny closets and almost no drawer space; usually not a big deal but a week's worth of formal business attire for two people requires hanging space -sporadic thermostats; not exactly sure why ours kept working when we set it to 50 or wouldn't turn on when we set it to 85 (it was freezing in the room!)-weird billing system; had a few issues with hotel adding too many temporary charges to the credit card and the staff providing different reasons for why this occurred. At the end we were not over billed, but the excess charges caused some stress until check-outOverall, I would only recommend this hotel based on price point. The location is its greatest asset, but it's not the only hotel in Mid-Town. The Double Tree, for example, has an even better location. Happy Travels!

<Content>Top Notch A great place to stay. We had a 3 night stay here in late November early December 08. A Yellow Cab from JFK to here was $49.50 ($45 flat rate to anywhere in Manhattan from JFK) including the toll for the bridge (dont ask which one as I haven't clue) .Although it is the only place I have stayed in New York, having spoken to some friends, this hotel seems to be one of the best on a reasonable budget.All 3+ star hotels in Manhattan are expensive. What makes them less/more expensive are their location and room size. Luckily this hotel offers clean, large rooms in a great location for a mid range budget. Better to get a decent hotel in a nice location than go for a low budget accomodation in a seedy part of town.The tube station is right outside the front door, or its 20 minutes walk to Times Square and Central Park. For the other sights I would advise the tube unless you really like walking. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are quiet, at least ours was, so they don't appear to be separated by thin plywood and actually have decent partitions. We had a room on the 25th floor with great views. I actually asked for a high room away from stairs and lifts and got exactly what I asked for. Big thumbs up.Hot water was always available and fresh towels were provided daily. Also the morning copy of USA newspaper was complimentary allowing you to take in some local culture during breakfast.We didn't have breakfast (not included) or any food in the hotel restaurant so I can't advise you on this. We did walk down to Times Square each morning for pancakes in Europa cafe which was nice to do before we hit the local sights.If this is your first time in New York you'll be pleased to know that contrary to Hollywoods portrayal, New York is quite safe to walk around, even after the sun has gone down, as is the underground. The streets around Times Square never quieten down and most of the streets around the hotel have banks and upmarket shops on. The chances of an unfavourable encounter completely alone on a quiet street, are no more than any other city.The local sights are all easily reachable by underground, although be advised that the underground trains on their respective lines, do not stop at every stop on their line. They tend to skip certain stops. Make sure you read the map and confirm the train you are getting on has the same letter/number as the stop you want. Common sense really, but we ended up having to get off and ride back on one occasion.There are a few nice local restaurants nearby. The usual fast food places, TGI Fridays, Mcdonalds etc are a short walk away. Some of the more upmarket places will need a reservation, and the hotel concierge is more than happy to make a reservation for you.Tipping while not a great part of British culture, is a big part of American culture. Almost all restuarants include 15% suggested gratuity on the bill. Even though the word suggested implies optional, it most certainly isn't. It is the minimal compulsory fee for service no matter how many of you are eating. Tipping elsewhere taxi's etc is at your discretion.Taxes aren't included in any of the food prices at restaurants so be prepared for a bill that is somewhat larger than anticipated in most cases. We thought we were getting a bargain at San Marinos Italian restaurant around the corner and it ended up costing us about 拢50 for some drinks, bread, lasagne, pasta dish and ice cream. Overall the quality of the food was not worth the money and the next night we settled for TGI's as we knew what we were getting for our money. Food portions were substantial enough although not as massvie as I was hoping. And no I'm not the size of a house (12 stone and 6ft at the last count so pretty average).Your expenses on shopping and food will vary according to the exchange rate of your country. We got $1.5 to 拢1 so it was pretty much as low as its been for a while. We didn't get any bargains on our trip and everything we saw was as much as it was in the UK. Our dreams of cheap Levi's and American merchandise were dashed by the current recession. Here are some costs to help you plan expenses:The tube costs $2 a trip or $7.50 for an all day pass.The Empire State $18 per person to get all the way to the top.Liberty/Ellis Island Ferry (every half hour for half an hour ride to the island) $12 per person. No access inside the statue thanks to terrorist threats.Ice Skating Rockefeller Centre (wrap up warm its outside) $15 per person.Well thats about it from start to finish. Hope it helps with your decisions.

<Content>Mom and daughter NYC adventure Took my daughter to NYC for her 16 birthday and stayed at this Courtyard Marriott. The location is excellent as it is convenient to everything (a subway station right outside the front doors) and the rooms are oversized. The staff is incredibly helpful and pleasant and you can tell they take pride in the property. Prior to this trip we have always stayed at the Marriott Marquis but from here on out we will save our money and stay at this Courtyard.

<Content>Phenomenal Value, Really Nice Hotel Hotel rooms in NYC are usually similar to London: overpriced and small. Rooms in NYC are usually so small you can barely move around. Based on the reviews from this website, I decided to give the Residence Inn a try. I was expecting a little bit bigger room, but I was blown away by the size of the room. It's probably 3x as big as a normal Westin/Marriott/Sheraton room. A king bed, sofa, full kitchen, flat screen TV, windows that open, free breakfast, free internet. It's not the level of a Four Seasons, but it's very nice indeed. My one complaint is that they really don't have a doorman to help you get a cab, etc. The staff is friendly.

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed 7 nights in this hotel and our choice was based on all the good reviews. We were not disappointed. Having 2 teenagers, boy 14 and girl 17 we booked a king suite, so they didn't have to sleep together in 1 bed. The room was unbelievably huge; 2 big rooms with a long hallway with 3 closets to put in all our clothes! We asked for an extra rollaway bed, but actually there was not a very good spot to place it. So finally our son slept on kind of a lounge chair next to our king size bed (bye bye privacy!). Our daughter slept on the pull-out sofabed in the livingroom which was not very comfortable and in our opinion not suitable for 2 people (beware!). We were a bit disappointed in the size of the bathroom, which was well equipped but very small for 4 people. Such a big room should have 2 bathrooms or an extra showerroom....Staff was very friendly and helpful. Views from the room were fantastic! Location superb, many good restaurants at walking distance, very good breakfastrestaurant (ess a bagel) if you like the real american bagel! The bellman was also very helpful. He arranged a taxi to take us to the airport and we got a stretch limousine for the price of a normal taxi, that was very comfy! Will certainly come again, but next time maybe book a double queen to save a bit of money (the suite was 560 dollars!).

<Content>Being 50 in New York! Have just returned from a short break of 6 nights. There were 6 of us. Our rooms were next to each other on the 26th floor with great views of Manhattan and the Chrysler Building. Rooms were a good size with two large doubles and a a small sofa bed. Very quiet. Friendly and knowlegable reception staff and concierge. We didn't eat in the hotel. Breakfast was taken in one of the many local diners and we then ate whereever we happened to be. Fantastic location we were able to walk to most places and the subway which was very easy to use was round the corner. Free internet service in the business centre to book our return seats. Our travel agent booked our taxi service to JFK but the hotel was actually cheaper.

<Content>Courtyard Marriott 3rd Avenue Just back from a great week in NY staying at the Courtyard Marriott 3rd Ave. We chose this hotel based on the reviews here and we were not disappointed. The room for three of us was very large and spotless. The Staff at this hotel make a difference, they are so friendly and efficient. My 80 year old mother was shocked at the kindness and courtesy extended to her by all she met. She remarked a number of times that the people of New York were so kind and helpful and particularly the young people, one offered her a seat on the E subway when we used it to go to Ground Zero (wish there was a better name for this graveyard). We walked everywhere from the hotel until we became brave and used the E and wondered then at the fear we had in relation to security. We saw no one scarier than ourselves. Initially it is best to walk to see the wonders of the buildings. We went to the outlets in Woodbury Common but found them quite disappointing and it was a cold day and going in and out of these shops was not good for our health, they had the heat up full in the shops. We went to the outlets in New Jersey, now that was a much better shopping experience and there is no tax on purchases there. The discount book offered in Woodbury common only counteracts the tax charges. The other great advantage of NJersey is that it is all under the one roof and the stores are bigger.Back to the Hotel, the free coffee/tea on the 12th Floor is a great idea and the area is kept spotless and the quality of the coffee is excellent. Use of computers on this level is also very useful.The Concierge is a very helpful and pleasant man and very knowledgeable. Bloomingdales is also very near, just 7 streets up.All in all, we would feel quite at home in the Courtyard Marriott on 3rd Avenue for our proposed trip next year because 6 days is not enough.Maura, Ireland.

<Content>Good Experience I stayed one night, on the 17th floor. The room (two queen beds with a sofabed) was clean and well kept. The bathroom was immaculate. Free coffee (24/7) on the 12th floor. The security was very tight and apparent. I felt very safe.My only (minor) complaint was the peculiar smell in the room of bread baking. It was very much like being situated over a bakery, which I don't believe I was. I was surprised the room had an odor considering how they tout the fact the property is non-smoking.But overall, a good positive experience.

<Content>The Best First trip to NYC. The entire experience at the Courtyard was excellent. They welcomed us after midnight as if they had been waiting for us all day and we were old friends. The room was a bit cold, so the engineer was up to the room to adjust the heat and provide an extra blanket in less than 5 minutes at 1:00 AM.The entrie staff could not have been better. They were friendly, answered every question, got us tickets, limos, and exceeeded every expectation we had. Those we met whose names I remember that were members of this great team are listed below:Sean - Asst General Mgr - The whole staff praised his leadershipJohn - Concierge - Trust his advice on places to see, restaurants, etc.Pedro and Will T Bell and Brandon Bell Service - They get you where you need to go when and with no hassles.Front Desk - Friendly and very helpfulRooms were very clean, sized right, near new furniture, comfortable bed, not noisy and great.My wife wanted a larger lobby, but once we found the 12th floor gathering area that issue was solved.

<Content>great place to stay we stayed here last october and i found the hotel was very clean and staff were very efficient. We stayed in a quadruple room which was a bit of a squeeze. The bedroom had a fab queen bed and then there was an uncomfortable sofa bed that slept 2. The room itself was cleaned everyday. There really wasn't much room for luggage we sort of had to stack our cases to make room to walk around. The staff were so helpful and pleasant. However don't bother with the restaurant/bar downstairs as it's a complete rip-off and they don't want you if you're not sitting down for a meal but to me thats no big deal as there are so many great restaurants in the city to choose from. I'd highly reccomend this hotel but don't entertain the quadruple room your better off with 2 twins and that way at least you have 2 bathrooms between 4!

<Content>Amazing Stay! Visited NYC for 4 nights and loved this hotel! Arrived around 12:00 and wasn't sure if our room would be ready since check in isn't til 4:00. Staff informed us that it would only be about 30 mins. We were able to go ahead and get information from the Concierge on tickets/siteseeing tours. He was very helpful....not knowing what some of the attractions consisted of he was very knowlegeable and was able to give us some good recomendations.Our room was huge.....this is one of the biggest rooms I have seen and considering it is in NYC, we were very impressed. We had 2 Queen and a pull out. We never felt like we were bunched up in a room. Subway station is next door as well as a 24hr drug store. McDonald's is about a block away. We were able to walk to the stop to get on the Siteseeing bus and it was only about 6 small blocks......very convient. We used to hotel and the car service for our ride back to the Airport and was very pleased with a black sedan at a rate of just $ 35.00.

<Content>Great customer service My two sisters and I get together once a year or so to have a fun NYC weekend, and it's important for us to stay together. This hotel was the only one in our price range that would guarantee separate beds. We had a very large room with two queen beds and a large (and comfortable) sofa bed. The obviously new beds and bedding were super-luxurious. All of our requests were accommodated (high floor, refrigerator, extra towels, etc.) My working sister appreciated the free wi-fi. And most important of all, the service people - front desk, bellmen, restaurant staff, housekeeping - were beyond helpful, cooperative, cheerful and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel for families and/or friends who want to hang out together instead of booking small separate rooms. We will definitely return.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in a great location Arrived at the hotel on 29th Aug for 4 nights,our room was a really good size with the most comfortable queen bed i've slept in,in any hotel i've ever stayed.The room was also really clean.The location of this hotel has to be one of its best features,it's really close to Bloomingdales,5th Ave,Rockefeller centre with times square only a 20 min walk.This was our first trip to nyc and we choose this hotel after reading the reviews on trip advisor.The staff were all really friendly and helpful especially the concierge who was a font of knowledge and a really nice guy,the complimentary tea and coffee was most welcome after a long day walking round manhattan as did the free internet access all located on the 12th floor.Overall this was a fantastic holiday and i would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about going to New York.

<Content>Great Location for transport We stayed at this Hotel for 6 nights with our two teenagers in August.We were in a 2 double and sofa bed room and admit that I was a little worried about there being a lack of room.There was no need to worry as the room was huge and spotlessly clean.we used the sofa bed so my daughters could have their own beds and the room still looked massive.The Hotel is on 3rd avenue and had plenty of buses going past heading uptown whislt one block away on Lexington the buses went Downtown.We were soon travelling everywhere by bus as it was just too hot on the subway platforms.As we had arrived after spending 6 days in Chicago I was grateful for the guest laundry.We did not try the Hotel breakfast but ate at the nearby au bon pain which was good value.The Hotel staff were always very Friendly and arranged transport back to the airport.I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling with teenagers as the Location was great and the rooms a great size for a family.

<Content>Great location, great for families We booked this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and were not disappointed! We reserved a room with 2 queen beds and a sofa sleeper for our family of five. The room was nicely decorated, large and spotlessly clean! We called housekeeping as soon as we got to our room to request extra bedding for the sofa bed and this was brought to us within 20 minutes. We also had a great view of the Chrysler building! The hotel is centrally located - in walking distance of Central Park, MOMA, the UN, Dylan's Candy Bar and other attractions! Only downside is that on weekends many breakfast/lunch type restaurants, like Pret A Manger, were closed. The hotel is also close to the subway. The Buttercup Bake Shop is on 2nd Avenue - a 5 minute walk from the hotel and is definitely worth a visit for their delicious red velvet cake! There is a Duane Reed on the same block as the hotel - very convenient for any forgotten toiletries or snacks. All in all, we were extremely happy with our 4 night stay here and would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Reasonably Priced Hotel Away from the Crowds We stayed at this hotel on the final 2 days of a 10-day New England vacation. We wanted something that was walking distance to 5th Avenue, but away from the crowds. This hotel was perfect for that. It is located on 3rd Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Street. This is primarily a business area of Manhattan so the tourist crowds were minimal. Nevertheless it seems as though many others on vacation had found this hotel also. One of the best aspects was the 53rd Street subway station access right outside the door. We used this extensively.The hotel was very clean and the rooms totally up-to-date. Service as good, but spectacular. Elevators were very fast and had express trips to upper floors. We paid $315 per night for room 2008 with 2 queen beds occupied by my wife and I and our 2 duaghters. We had a spectacular veiw looking south towards the Chrysler building. We found this to be a good price for a quality hotel in the middle of August. I'd recommend the Courtyard Manhattan Midtown East to both business and pleasure travelers to New York City.

<Content>Just as good the second time This is our second stay at this hotel and it lived up to our previous good impressions. While the entrance and lobby may not be as grand as some, this was more than made up by the friendly staff and the excellent rooms.We particularly liked the fact that we could do our own laundry and the views from the top floor bedrooms are just typical NYC.We'll go back to this hotel next time!

<Content>Good hotel, good location This hotel is located on 3rd Avenue between 52nd and 53rd. There is a 24 hour drug store downstairs (very convenient) and a subway stop (lines E  V, with access to the 4, 5  6 lines) on the corner. I like this location because it is easy to get to the tourist attractions, but you don't feel like you are in the middle of all the crowds. The rooms are a good size by NYC standards and the hotel is clean. The lobby is small and can feel crowded when it is full of people who are checking in/out. Overall, I recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Spacious Rooms Six of us shared a room here this month for a girlfriends getaway. We chose this particular hotel because of the room size and the fact that it looked like it could fit a group our size. There were two queens and a pull out sofa and we were very comfortable. The staff had the sofa bed already made up for us and were very responsive to any requests. It was just a great hotel and staff. We LOVED Pedro the bellman. What a doll. He made us laugh every time we saw him. All the other great stuff has already been said. No one would be disappointed staying here.

<Content>The reviews are right! I booked this hotel largely based on the excellent reviews on this site which turned out to be spot on. The hotel was spotlessly clean. We had an enormous room with two queen beds and a bed settee, perfect as it meant that our two daughters had a bed each. Lots of space to dump shopping each day. We made good use of the Duane Reade next to the hotel and the Oxford Cafe around the corner. The subway stop a few steps from the hotel was also convenient, although being four of us it was often cheaper to take a cab.Due to the location of the hotel it also made walking to most places very easy.I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it.

<Content>Great NYC hotel Was very impressed with the Courtyard Marriott Midtown East. The hotel is in a great location...you are not right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Times Square but close enough to walk there. There were many options to eat, drink, sightsee within walking distance. Plus the subway stops right outside the hotel!The room was spotless and very clean. Check-in took us less than a minute and we were helped to our room by the friendly bellman. Overall the hotel was great and I would recommend it to family and friends looking for a centrally located and clean hotel in the heart of Manhattan.

<Content>Faultless ! My wife  I enjoyed a 3 night stop over in NYC at beginning of August what turned out to be a great trip was made even better by staying at this hotel. We have stayed in many hotels from many chains worldwide and to be honest in terms of the basic facilities, then this hotel is as good as any. If you want to pay a premium for a mega hotel with many choices of restaurants, bars, cafes  shops then this hotel is not for you. If you want an unassuming hotel, that is spotlessly clean, extremely efficient service, fantastic size rooms (by NYC standards) with all the usual facilities at hand then you can鈥檛 go far wrong. As for value for money then accepting NYC can be very expensive then we paid c. GB拢150 per night which was in retrospect excellent value as the rate we took was advertised on the internet and included full buffet breakfast, which was in itself impressive in quality  choice providing both hot  cold options. We found this a real bonus and offered a considerable cost saving. It has to be noted that this rate is not necessarily readily available and unbelievably that not many of the guests were aware of it. On check in (itself effortless  met with courteous staff) I asked if I could have a high room  was given a room on the 29th floor which turned out to be ideal  was completely free of any outside noise with fantastic views thrown in. As for access then this hotel is ideally located for the subway which has an entrance some 25 yards from the hotel putting access to Grand Central well within 10 鈥?15 minutes. Indeed even better for anyone arriving from JFK then you can travel to the subway station direct from the JFK terminal transfer at Jamaica without further change in around 30 minutes or so for $7 safely  probably depending on time of day much quicker than a cab ! Best advice book early, this hotel is justifiably very popular and rates can increase dramatically, and don鈥檛 forget to seek out the all in breakfast rate. This hotel fully justifies its high rating on Trip advisor a 鈥済em !鈥?

<Content>Perfectly happy with Courtyard Midtown East I am more than happy to recommend this hotel to families and couples alike. On arrival we were dealt with immediately and efficiently. Everywhere appeared very clean, we stayed on the 21st floor and had no problem with noise, except the Air com was rather loud, but got used to it after the first night. Our room was large and airy, we had 2 queen beds and bed settee all were very comfortable. Bathroom was clean and met our needs. The rooms was well cared for and decoration was of a good standard. We requested a fridge and this was delivered immediately. The business centre was good with the use of 3 computers with printers (ideal to run directions, tickets etc). Coffee making facilities in the bedroom but much easier to pop to the 12th floor and get free tean and coffee from the machine. Well situated for the subway and pharmacy next door, Mcdonalds a few minutes away (popular with teenage son) and nice little store were you could buy fresh foods for breakfast and take back to room. Would definitely stay again and would recommend it to anyone who asked.

<Content>An excellent family hotel. We booked this hotel on recommendation from fellow trip advisors. It was an excellent choice. The reservation through expedia was easy and we were expected upon arrival. The staff, especially the security guy, were extremely helpful. The room was spotlessly clean and the beds were so comfortable. The location was great for first-timers in NYC as we were just at a north-south subway line and everything was within a short ride. We travelled with 2 girls and a boy and booked room 2407 with 2 queens and a sofa bed. The view over Manhatten to the water was great. The neighbourhood was amazing too; a mix of business and residential. So I would definitely recommend a stay that involved a late breakfast / early lunch in the local deli's on say Friday to experience the buzz and a walk around the area without the traffic on a Sunday just to see it in a different light. We especially liked Ray Bari Pizza and the Pig and Whistle Pub (turn left as you exit the hotel). There is 24 hour food in Azure (turn right 1 block) if you get back after a long walk and just need a snack but don't need a full meal out. I have to say that we were a bit phased about booking anywhere in NYC after reading the many dodgy reports about various hotls and we booked this because nobody seemed to have anything negative to say about it (well nothing that we considered reasonably worrying). Rest assured you won't go wrong here. We had a great experience . We recommend it 100%. I think there may be a price increase on the way from what I heard at front desk, but if you budget wisely and cost it in, you won't be disappointed. Oh, one more thing if you are a first-timer to NYC ... there is a lot of hype about going to outlet stores for bargains. Shop wisely downtown, try Century 21 at the WTC site, and get the 11% discount card in Maceys ... it will save you $40 bus fare and 3 hours in traffic. If you love shopping, forget about this advice and just go. You can book the bus ticket at the front dask, just ask.

<Content>One of the Best Kept Secrets Based on the strength of the reviews read on Trip Advisor we first stayed at this hotel in December of 2007. We returned for a one week stay in June of 2008. This is a great place with spacious rooms, especially for mid town NYC. Check in was effortless, even with our early arrival. Front desk staff were efficient and courteous. Our room was on the 31st floor with the Chrysler Building to gaze upon. (Can you tell it is my favorite!) Room was clean with two queens and a sofa bed. The refrigerator and extra towels were there as requested at reservation time. Free internet access and a safe large enough for laptop computer plus other valuables. Close to subway lines, places to eat and Duane Reede drugstore. Pedro  Wilfredo are two of the most capable, professional  helpful bellmen you will find in any hotel regardless of the number of stars it carries. Do not hesitate to ask them for help with anything.Cannot say enough good things about the Courtyard Midtown/Eastside. But please keep it our little secret.

We requested a refrigerator, which they provided free of charge.There are safes inside the room which is nice to have. The location of the hotel is great. There is a big drugstore (Duane Reed) right next to the hotel and a CVS a block away. Also a block away was a McDonalds and a deli/store.Would stay here again.

<Content>Perfect for our Mom-Daughter Trip We recently spent four nights at this hotel - two moms and our 20-something daughters and it was great! We chose it specifically for the large room since there were four of us sharing. Our room had two queen beds (not fulls as some hotels have) as well as a coffee table, sofa sleeper, desk and dresser - and the room didn't feel a bit crowded. We asked in advance for a refrigerator in the room and it was provided at no extra charge. We were able to check in a little after one o'clock. We loved the convenience of the 12th floor business center and 24-hr. coffee and tea availability. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, preferring to venture out to the many restaurants within walking distance. We walked EVERYWHERE from this conveniently located hotel (OK - not to the Staten Island ferry, but nearly everywhere else!). I had read some negative reviews about the hotel being ordinary etc. but if this is ordinary in Manhattan for $300 a night, that's fine with me. Only complaint - bathroom is on the small side.

<Content>Convenience, Comfort  I decided to book this hotel after reading the positive reviews on Tripadvisor, as well as comparing its proximity to public transportation and away from the usual 'tourist' areas i.e. Times Square.Check in was a breeze and I was in my room within 5 minutes of walking up to the front desk. Upon entering the room, I noticed the AC was on, but the room felt rather humid, which was not what I expected on a warm July day. I mentioned this to Mark on my way out to lunch and he said he would have a different room available upon my return. Lo and behold, Mark came through and he even managed to find a room on the same floor, which made moving rooms easy. He definitely was very customer friendly and asked if everything was OK with the new room later in the day. You can't ask for better service than that!If you need places to eat, there are a few places within walking distance (2-4 blocks from the hotel) such as Outback Steakhouse (four blocks away) or Houston's (great American dining, but more expensive) on the first level of the Citicorp Building located on 53rd St on Third Ave. If you ever need to pick up toiletries, snacks, or have a prescription filled while traveling, you can't go wrong with the Duane Reade located next to the hotel or the CVS just a couple of blocks away. I was so happy having these options at my fingertips that I picked up some late evening snacks when I got back from a long day spent in NYC. Walk out of DR and walk 20 steps and you're in front of the hotel. Talk about convenience.The room was very clean, the linens were fresh and contrary to what others have said, I didn't find the room to be noisy even though I was on the 7th floor during my entire stay.Having access to the subway (E  V trains) was ideal as the E train takes you right to Times Square, to downtown Manhattan very near to Ground Zero or if you need to fly out of JFK Airport, you can connect to the AirTrain at the Sutphin Blvd. stop in Queens - total cost $7.All in all, this hotel had everything I was looking for including its proximity to LaGuardia airport, which was only 20-25 minutes away by taxi. You can't go wrong with this hotel, if you want a great place to come back to after a long day of sightseeing or conducting business. I will definitely stay at this hotel on my next trip to NYC.

<Content>Very Satisfied We stayed for a week and I would defintitely stay at this hotel again. I thought that the staff was very helpful and the rooms are good sized and clean. We used the concierge quit a bit and they were very helpful. On the 12th floor there is always free coffee and tea available as well as 3 computers with internet access. However, I should mention that whenever I tried to use the computer they were all taken. I did not use the restaurant at all so I cannot comment on that. We requested a refrigerator, which they provided free of charge, and we chose to eat cereal in our room. There are safes inside the room which is nice to have. The one thing that bothered me about the room was that the bathroom door did not stay open. It always closed and that might be because it was very close to the door of the room so they have it purposely set to close. I found myself propping it open with the waste basket for the times where I didn't need the door closed. The location of the hotel is great. There is a big drugstore (Duane Reed) right next to the hotel and a CVS a block away. Also a block away was a McDonalds and a deli/store. The hotel is a about a mile from Times Square. Times Square are is so loud and crowded that I was glad to stay at a hotel away from that area. We sometimes walked there and back and other times we took the subway. THere is a subway station right next to the hotel and another one a couple blocks away. The area seems very safe and there are lots of people walking around at night. They have a Lincoln towncar that takes you to LaGuardia for $35 so that was nicer than taking a cab.

<Content>average but on the good side Booked this as reviews and price were good. It is a normal marriott courtyard quality and clean, fair rooms for manhattan, friendly personnel. But even on higher floors soundproofing was not very good, airco was also not very silent. We had bad luck that nearby they started construction, and continued the night which kept us partially awake.I requested late checkout but it was not granted due to busy period. It was also for the late checkout I chose this hotel but apparently no guarantees on that.....

<Content>Great Hotel Stay My philosophy when staying in New York is that we spend more time out of the room then in it, so we look for a good mid-priced option. With that in mind, this was one of the best and largest rooms I've stayed in in New York. We traveled with our three-year old daughter, and having the sleeper sofa was so helpful--we could still get a king-sized room and not worry about space for her . While you were close enough to walk to many of midtown's attractions, (Grand Central, Times Square, 5th Avenue shopping, Central Park), it was a good, quiet space for sleep. Plus, a subway stop is steps from the hotel, so you can easily get anywhere. To top it off, the staff were friendly and helpful--the concierge even recommended where I could buy dress shoes for my daughter. Will definitely consider staying there my next visit!

<Content>Comfortable  This Courtyard was clean, had large size rooms, bed a bit lumpy but OK. I don't like east midtown very much for location, but on a short notice business trip I didn't have too much choice. At a rate of $500 a night I would have thought I could get the Waldorf, but that's not the hotel's fault. That's just NYC for ya.The biggest reason I'm writing a review for this hotel is that they have ONSITE TECH SERVICE. Perhaps this is more common than I think, but most places I stay, when you have trouble connecting to their internet, you have to call a support line, sit on hold, and have some moron ask you scripted questions like is the cable plugged in? However this hotel, when I had an issue connecting to their network, sent up a technician within 5 minutes to help me! AND, what's more, he FIXED THE PROBLEM! Unbelievable. Just for that one reason this hotel stands out in my mind.

<Content>Start Spreading the news about this hotel! Booked this hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor, everything said was spot on! We were on the 26th floor (Ask for a high floor as lots of traffic noise) we had a newly renovated room with 2 queen beds, the room was clean and the housekeeping came round everyday. There is free tea/coffee on the 12th floor and also computers with free internet access which we used to check in online for our flight home. The hotel is situated away from the hustle and bustle of times square, but if you dont mind walking it would take about 20mins to get there or a taxi would cost around $6 or $7. There is also plenty places to eat nearby.

Al the porter will sort you out with anything you need he's good. Food just go round the corner onto 2nd and the Morning Star had everthing to start your day off in wonderful New York. Citysights hop on hop off bus great way to see all sights.If you can walk the hotel is in ideal spot away from bustle to walk to most places. Al will get you a stretch limo back to airport as cheap as cab ,we got yellow cab to hotel no problem pretty quick. Can't wait to go back to NY and will use this hotel again. B  J

<Content>Very comfortable break We stayed at the Courtyard New York Manhattan in February 2008. It was our first visit to New York and we were not disappointed. I found this hotel on Trip Advisor. We stayed for six nights and found the price very reasonable. The hotel is situated in a quieter part of Manhattan but very accessible by bus, taxi or undergound. Having said that, we walked just about everywhere. The week was very cold and windy but we were well prepared. Broadway is an easy and safe 15 -20 mins walk. Central Station is 5 mins away. We found the staff very friendly and very helpful. The bedroom was very comfortable. The breakfast, either continental or cooked was excellent. Email and Web facilities were supposed to be available in the room but the staff admitted they didn't work. Having said that, there were computers on the 10th? floor. We took the Grey Line open top bus tours around the island including the Brooklyn loop and the night tour. We visited the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island (well worth it); Ground Zero, Empire State Building (go early) and Central Station. Also St. Patricks Cathedral and the Rockefeller Center. We took a bus to New Jersey from the Port Authority Terminal to visit relatives. On our last day we had snow and decided to visit Central Park which was wonderful. During our stay we took in two shows on Broadway - Phantom of the Opera and Spamalot. A very enjoyable, hastle free week.

Close to subway and many decent bars and budget eating choices nearby.

We were treated like royality. It was kids' first trip to NYC and they will never forget it! The location is wonderful, it is the right in the middle of everything! Go right and you walk to uptown and go left and walk to downtown. There are also several restaurants around the area. The concierge is very helpful. Ask for a fridge, it is completely FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Thanks, tripadvisor! GREAT HOTEL! Great hotel, great staff, quiet rooms, excellent location, nearby restaurants and shops, no complaints!We checked in and asked for a room away from the elevator, and were told we could check in our bags and come back later when a room was available. The bellboy then told us that a large room was available, but that it was near the elevator, which you couldn't hear. He took us up to an 03 room (that is, a room ending in 03, like 1803, 1903), put us in the room, and then operated the elevator, which we did NOT hear. And we did not hear our neighbors to either side, or above us at any time. And the room with two queen beds was VERY spacious (he said it was one of the larger room layouts in the hotel)!There was a subway station on the corner, a drug store downstairs, and Starbucks, sandwich, pastry, health food, Jamba, breakfast, and other stores within a two block radius in every direction. The area was quieter at night than Times Square, or other parts of the city, which was best in this city for getting rest from running around during the day.The concierge was great, scoring tickets the SAME DAY for South Pacific, and the friendly and efficient staff accommodated our every request, including cleaning our room over the dinner hour when we mistakenly left the Do Not Disturb hanger on the door when we left for the day.If you want bars, nightclubs, and nightlife AT your hotel, stay in noisy Times Square, and live it up! If you want a centrally located hotel with an excellent staff, large, quiet rooms, and everything you might need nearby, this is the place!

<Content>Great stay at Courtyard This hotel is a fantastic find in midtown. The rooms are at least 50% larger than are the ones at the Marriott Eastside located only minutes away - and they are much cheaper, including free internet access. Staff was very friendly. Ask for a high room if possible - the views are wonderful. Although the restaurant onsite does not offer room service, Courtyard has a deal worked out with the nearby Outback Steakhouse for delivery at a very reasonable charge. All rooms have been recently renovated, and have the most comfortable hotel beds I've experienced in a long, long time. Overall, this is a nice find in a great location. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Huge Rooms by NYC Standards I stayed at this Courtyard for two nights on business travel and was amazed by the size of the rooms. Not only are the rooms large by New York City standards, but also by Courtyard standards in general. The corner room I was assigned was larger than the rooms I've stayed in at comparable Courtyards across the country.Aside from that, you can't go wrong with this hotel. Standard Courtyard all the way. Quiet room, good bed, hot water, and adequate internet. I didn't stop by the pool or eat breakfast in the restaurant, but why bother when the city beckons?!This hotel has a pretty good location in Midtown. Close to the train, and a short 15 minute cross-town hike to Times Square. I wouldn't expect a quintessential New York experience if you're on leisure travel, but if you're heading to the city on business, book away!

<Content>Great Stay ! We stayed at the Courtyard for 5 days/4 nights in June. Our room was very spacious (at least by NYC standards). We had a corner room on the 26th floor with a great view looking down 3rd.The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only potential negative was breakfast. The hot buffet was nothing particularly special (at around $16 per person). We didn't eat any other meals at the hotel.The hotel is within easy walking distance of Rockefeller Center (about 1/2 mile to the west). The UN is also an easy walk east. We found a great selection of eating establishments on 2nd Avenue near the hotel.I would stay here again.....

<Content>A Great Value in Midtown We spent 4 nights at this hotel in May based on the reviews posted on this sight. Given the price level of hotels in NYC, we were fully satisfied with the price/value proposition of this property.The hotel had standard Courtyard functionality, nothing fancy. Our 2 weekend nights were almost $100 less per night than the 2 weekday nights. Having stayed at a number of Courtyards before, we particularly appreciate the breakfast buffet, the laundry machines, and the free access to computers to check e-mail, etc.While a few blocks away from Rockefeller Center and Times Square, there is a subway station located at the corner, which we made extensive use of.There is a big Duane Reade drugstore in the same building and a variety of useful restaurants (Chipotle and similar) and shops (Barnes and Noble,etc.) are located in the office buidings within a block.Unless you need a 4-star hotel or need to stay in the middle of the action, this hotel is a fine option.

<Content>Convenient and Comfortable Just returned from a 3-night stay at this hotel. I was in town to see my family, and needed access to Grand Central Station. As a woman traveling alone, I wanted a place where I felt safe and comfortable-this hotel definitely fit the bill. I had no trouble at check-in, and was pleased with the size of the room. The king-size bed was very comfortable. I took advantage of the free computer access the hotel offers at its 12th-floor business center. I had not brought my own computer, and was pleased to find that the hotel offered computer use to its guests for free. I had breakfast every morning at the hotel buffet. I thought the price was a bit high for the quality of the food- but it was very convenient. The hotel's location on 3rd Avenue was perfect for my needs. The 5-star rating is for a hotel of this type- in other words, this was not a resort or a luxury establishment- but for a hotel offering relatively well-priced and functional accommodations in Midtown, it did the job well. I got a AAA discount, which helped my evaluation- I would not want to pay $300+ for this hotel, and I didn't.

<Content>Very good, if a bit boring Stayed here for 7 nights in late May. Checked in and out within a (New York) minute, the beds are fantastic, the entire room was very clean and fresh, great water pressure in the shower. Got great help from both the concierge and the bellman (who got us a nice limo for our trip back to JFK). One small complaint would be that when I asked for a European power adapter at the desk, they said they would send it to my room. It never arrived and I had to ask again. No biggie of course. Be aware though that this is foremostly a business hotel. It's a bit boring and you won't find any New York charm here. But if you want a clean, spacious and well-appointed room to come home to after a long day in the city, you can't go wrong with this Courtyard.

<Content>Very pleased! My husband and I stayed here over the weekend. I couldn't have been more pleased. Last time I stayed in Manhattan, we stayed at the Milford Plaza - the room was tiny, tiny,tiny. Noisy all night.The Courtyard has very large rooms - big enough for a king size bed and a sleeper sofa, desk and dresser and closet. Room was clean and nicely decorated. We were on the 14th floor - never heard the first traffic noise at night.The lobby is small, nothing special but the staff was helpful and responsive.The location was great. About 6 blocks from Time Sq. 10-15 minute walk. Even closer to Rockefeller Plaza and some other attractions. Right on the subway line. I loved being away from the noise and hustle/bustle of Times Square. We are planning to stay again in the fall with our teenage son.Rate was reasonable - we paid $269 a night.

<Content>Great Location, Great Service This was a great room. My three best friends and I visited New York Memorial Day Weekend for a girlfriends reunion. We came from four different states. The room was large and clean. The beds are very comfortable. I am usally hard on hotels but this more than exeeded my expectations. The lobby was small but very cute. The bell service men were the best in getting cabs and giving tips to get meals. This hotel is a great location to almost everythings. The bellservice guys will even arrange for you to get a car. A special thanks to Rohan for assiting us with transportation. This hotel is a great place if you are going to be out and about during most of the day.The drug store next door has ATM, food, and all you need. The Pig and Whistle on 2nd was a great inexpensive place to eat.We would defintely go back. The location is safe the police department is around the corner.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised Our usual place in the city was going for an exorbitant rate so my husband's assistant put me here. I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby is small and cramped--more of a hallway, really. I think a lot of the guests are loyal Marriott travelers--I heard a few checking in who were using their points. My room (a superior room on a high floor) was light and bigger than I might have thought (after seeing that tiny lobby), and the bed was very comfortable. The location was handy to the subway and a quick walk to 5th Avenue. There were decent delis nearby for a quick bite and although I did not check it out there was a restaurant tucked on another floor. It's no Waldorf, but then I don't want to pay Waldorf prices. In NYC I'm looking for clean and safe, and this fit the bill on both counts.

<Content>not bad, on a par with an up market travellodge in the uk Booked via the marriott website, its always worth logging on to it and selecting the hotel that you want, and checking out the per property special offers that appear on that site....I found this after booking the marriott marquis in times square, this was some 200 dollars a night cheaper and thinking what we could do with the extra GBP 拢 we'd save moving slightly out of the main drag, i rebooked to come to the courtyard..... In fact, its about an 8 dollar cab ride (ie the price of a beer in central london in some places!) to broadway and the theatres around the marquis from this hotel........Ok, so what are the differences I've noticed between a courtyard and a main stream marriott (as you will see i've stayed in a few from my other reviews)............This to me reminds me of a three star hotel with limited facilities.........the rooms are clean, and the renovated room we had on the 28th floor was big enough to leave the bags out without triping over them every 5 minutes...........other things noted, there's no glitzy bar here in the hotel (no problem, you're in an area full of bars and restaurants), the menu is slightly reduced from the marriott i stayed in last week in the restaurant for breakfast but still passable. I would liken this much to a travellodge in central london, everythings there that you really NEED, this hotel is ideal if you are a person that is here to do sightseeing and you're going to be out all day.....The free internet in the room is via a wired connection, the cable is a bit short, so if you want to work whilst sitting on the bed, bring your own cat5 cable thats about 5 metres to reach from desk to bed.....its ok for speed but i used it over a weekend so may be slower during a business week....bad points, not much, for brits, bring your own tea for the room if you're a tea person, in general tea in the states is substandard.Given the close proximity to timesquare and broadway and the cheap cost of a cab (you could walk as well, NY is a bit more pedestrian friendly compared to say LA) i would probably stay here again........watch out for taxes on the rates, our room was 299 plus taxes of 38 usd on top per night......kerching, the government is making a lot out of tourism here......even more than california!If you can do without the glitz, this will fit the bill........to be honest for a brit like me, staying in the thick of timesquare is no longer appealling, it seems very noisy, lit up like piccadilly in london with adverts and crawling with visitors at a pace that makes oxford street in london seem like a 100m sprint...why 3*'s ? On a benchmark of my other stays it has to be a mid range place, the other hotels are hard acts to follow in some cases...

<Content>Customer Service Problems I always figured hotels were in the hospitality business. Well, this one proved me wrong.First the hotel: the rooms were perfectly fine motel rooms, but at a hotel price. No lobby and no wi-fi. Bathrooms were clean, bed was comfortable. Desk chair was terrible - completely unusable. To use the wired internet connection at the desk, I had to get rid of the terrible chair and move the couch over to the desk. Also, the phone was broken. The service guy came right away but couldn't fix it until the next day.Now the service. 1. They lost half my reservation and demanded a 50% upcharge. I called and scheduled 4 nights, Fri-Tues., and we even spoke about the Monday night in particular when making the reservation so I know they had all 4 nights. When we arrived they only had us for 2 nights. They demanded to see my confirmation number, which I gave them, and still they only had 2 nights for me, and refused to honor my reservation while basically making me feel like I was at fault and had made the whole thing up.2. I had the original reservation on one credit card, but when checking in I gave them a different credit card to pay. They then double charged us for the first 2 nights, putting those 2 nights on both credit cards! When I got the bill on the morning we were leaving, I went to have them fix this problem, but the person at the desk couldn't help me and told me the manager would be in later and would take care of it. Nobody got back to me. By the time I had to check out at noon, I finally called the manager and she refused to do anything at all, again making me feel like I had done something wrong. So now I've had to have my credit card company fix their mistake.Overall, not once did anyone tell me they would do their best to help me with any of the problems. Instead, they demanded proof from me or right off told me they wouldn't be able to help, and generally made me feel like I was doing something wrong every time. Clearly, Marriott does not empower their employees to help their guests, and this Marriott in particular has a serious service problem.

<Content>A touch above functionary This hotel was good choice with a family of four, that included two boys ages 6 and 8. We had requested an early check in and were in our room by 10:30am. Our room was large, clean, quiet and included a king with a sofa bed. The hotel is located on 3rd /53rd Ave and has multiple subway lines within a block. There are plenty of restaurant choices nearby. The Morning Star Cafe on 2nd/51st was a nice place for a sit down breakfast that was inexpensive. Bistro Deseret on 56th was a delicious place for dinner. The hotel lacks the luxourious touches, but is ideal for the business traveller or family that uses the hotel as a base for exploring the city.

<Content>clean, but issues with service I understand it is always hard to meet expectations in a service industry, but too many strikes against the marriott on this visit.I reserved 3 rooms. After being told that they could all be on the same floor, only two were on the same floor. Having arrived at 3pm, I could only get into one room.They messed up one of my relatives reservations, and would not honor the original room rate (only a small nightly difference).I called for my car, which was valet parked ($45/day), and it took 35 minutes to get it, even though it was 6 in the morning. I went downstairs to get a luggage cart to get my suitcases out of our rooms when leaving. When I got back downstairs, I was instructed that I wasn't allowed to take the carts. Other items to note: No lobby to speak of. No food other than breakfast. room service is delivery from a nearby restaurant. As you can read, none of these were serious offenses. The rooms were clean. Shower had plenty of hot water. Rooms were a perfectly reasonable size. Breakfast buffet was fine.I'll stay elsewhere the next time I am in NYC. At $200/night, this would have been fine. At $375, I expected more.

Good location, within 4 blocks of Rockefeller Ctr. Clean and comfortable, especially since all you're looking for is a place to shower and sleep.

<Content>Convenient basic hotel This hotel is a typical american Courtyard Marriott. Nothing fancy, but convenient and you get what you pay for.Rooms are bigger than average, and being on the 28th floor there was no traffic noise, so getting a good night's sleep was not a problem.Walking distance to most places in mid Manhattan, and a subway station right ouside the door.Many restaurants nearby and a few drugstores.Workout facilities and business center.Free wifi.All you need basically.Nothing to complain about, except the key card, which stopped working all the time and had to be reloaded.Staff friendly and service minded. The only thing missing is a restaurant/bar.Would not hesitate booking this hotel again.

<Content>Marvellous Marriott We chose the Courtyard Marriott for our April stay in New York from the reviews published on Trip Advisor , we were not disappointed. We researched in January and the price per night was under (not much) 拢150 per night, unfortunately delayed booking till March and the price for the same period had gone up to under 拢200, lesson is book early. However I checked the Marriott website and found they give a discount to over 62 's so that brought the price back down. The hotel is on 3rd Avenue up about 52nd street just down from Bloomingdales, a nice area and quite convenient, well within walking distance of the subway, Central Park, St Patricks Cathedral, Grand Central Station, Rockafeller Centre, and Times Square.The hotel frontage is quite small and plain and has a convenient drug store next door, the foyer is also small and functional, the front desk staff and porters were excellent in all respects. Our room was on the 19th floor and large (I understand this is usual for the hotel and is a big plus) with a large bathroom, bed and a settee which converts to another bed. Good wardrobe space and mirrors TV and coffee percolator. There was no fridge but the concierge provided one on request. The booking was for room only and a good reasonably priced breakfast buffet was available in a pleasant dining area on the 12th floor, or there were lots of diners around which we also used but found a bit frenetic. There is a business centre with pcs and printers which was useful in prebooking attractions (esb) and a Broadway show (Mama Mia excellent and pre show dinner in the Rainbow Grill in the Rockefeller Centre), there is also a fitness centre which we didnt have time to use. There is no bar or lounge as such which is a slight drawback but doesn't detract much from the overall value and is overcomable with the many bars and restaurants locally.I must mention our favourite local restaurant which was Mimi on 2nd Avenue approx 52nd street, Italian, piano player. bags of atmosphere and very good food and value. Must also mention Rohan ( at the front desk) always a greeting and arranged for the excellent Flavio to take us to the airport in his limousine at roughly the same price as a taxi, well worth it.

<Content>Worth every penny!!! My 3 sons and I spent 3 nights at this property May 1-4, 2008. Our room was very large by comparison to almost any other non-suite hotel. It had 2 queen beds and a pull-out couch. The room was clean and well appointed. The bathroom (toilet and tub/shower) is separated from the sink and closet area by a door which made use by more than 1 person quite easy. Both were clean with appropriate toiletries and soft towels.The free internet access did not work. Housekeeping was slow in responding to a request to make up the pull-out the first night. After that the room was promptly made up each day.Staff contact was minimal but check-in was smooth. Al, the bellman, was gracious and very helpful during the entire stay. He arranged for a car to take us to the airport on our departure day at a price that was less than a cab would have been and much less than the limo service we hired for the trip from the airport. John, the concierge, was friendly and helpful but be careful about his restaurant recommendations.The view from our 30th floor room was nondescript but none of the 4 of us spent anything more than a passing moment looking out to check the weather. As has been previously stated, the lobby is small and not ornate but, unless you are trying to impress someone, more than adequate.We did not try the breakfast that is available.All mid-town Manhattan hotels are expensive. This one is no different. This one is, however, well worth the money.

Paid 拢300 for 2 nights, on arrival was upgraded to room which was huge, two large double beds and five windows. Had fab view towards central park. Consiege was great recommended a fab steak house and got us reservations on a sat night....Bobby Vans.This hotel is a 8 min walk to times square passing the waldorf and rockafella. Very safe neighbourhood. Ate in Mcdonalds down the block for breakfast. I would def stay her again. Cannot be faulted for location, quality or price.The hotel airport transfer service was great booked transfer for 4am was waiting for us and cost $70 including tolls. Much cheaper than elsewhere. Although early hours of morning still took 1hour to get to Newark due sat nightclub traffic.I have stayed in New york on three occassions and will def be coming back to this hotel.

<Content>Big room, great location, 2 Queen beds, all good We were a family of 4, with daughters aged 7  10 making their first trip to NYC. Marriott is a favorite of ours, but they often have 2 doubles in their rooms instead of 2 queens. This hotel has 2Q rooms, and our room was large, with the two queens and a sofa. Nice view of the Chrysler tower out the window, and a very good location relative to subway, central park, Broadway, Lexington, Park, you name it. Service was very friendly. As other reviews have stated, the lobby is nothing. Just a place to check in and find the elevator, which was fine with us. Right next door to a large Duane Reade drug store. Not a lot of great restaurants nearby, but more Starbucks than you can shake a stick at. Bathroom's a bit small but nice enough, and they delivered a little fridge to the room for free. Paid over $300/ night, but it's midtown Manhattan, and that's the way it is. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Would Highly Recommend Excellent 2 day stay here a few days ago with our 2 toddlers.Warm welcome, lovely spacious clean room on 31st floor. We had booked an oversized corner room, and it really did have plenty of space for a family of 2 adults, 2 children, suitcases, shopping etc. There was a fridge but no microwave (which would have been useful with small children, but not a problem). Fantastic views.We arrived late from Europe, kids were tired, so ordered food to the room (this comes from a restaurant up the street I understand - and not 'room service' as we know it in Europe!). Food was reasonably OK - but would have been a lot better if it was hot!! My advice is, unless you are in the same situation as us, with exhausted kids needing bed - don't bother ordering in this food, go out and eat instead!Staff were great, pleasat, helpful and friendly. Location was good, excellent for 5th Ave, Disney Store etc - not sot good for Times Square, Empire State etc. We did end up getting taxis back to the hotel mostly. But without small kids in tow, you would not need to do this and could easily walk most places.Overall, a very enjoyable stay - and by my small son was overawed by the stretch limo arranged by the hotel to take us to the airport (cost was only $10 more than a taxi).Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Place to Stay in NYC We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. It was an excellent experience from check-in until check-out. Our bellman was super and took a great deal of interest in us. He set up our departure to the airport for Thursday, early morning. The room was spacious with a clean bathroom. The bathroom was well supplied with ample clean towels, shampoos and lotions, and a working hair dryer. We left our maid a tip each morning. Each night we would return to receive a handwritten thank you note for that tip. We have done a lot of travel worldwide, and have NEVER had the maid write us a thank you note!! We were impressed and our room was well cared for. We were on the 25th floor and got very little street noise. We found plenty of delis and great places to get a snack within close walking distance. We travelled by taxi to some of the places we wanted to go (Macy's, theater district 2 nights) and only had to wait seconds for a cab to arrive. If you will be traveling by subway, there are 2 terminals just steps away. There is a pharmacy next door and a news stand out front. In our opinion, what more could you want??

I went on a weekend vacay with my husband and son (age 5) and not only did we check in early but also when we noticed a small mistake on out bill, it was fixed within minutes of a call down to the front desk. The location is also very convenient, close to all of my sons favorite spots... Central Park, FAO Schwartz and Dylans candy bar!! And for mom... a great shoe store right up the street! How can you go wrong? I will continue to stay here year after year as long as the staff and management keep up their impeccable service and standards. All in all the best room for the price in NY, bar none!

<Content>Second Stay at the Courtyard Midtown I personally LOVE this hotel, it is so convenient to everything and everyone at the hotel is so nice!! You can not beat the price $265 a night including taxes. We were in town for one night, March 14th to attend a cheerleading competition for my daughter. We booked a King Room with a pull out couch and it was perfect for the 3 of us. I should of requested a corner room which I have had in the past, they are definitely bigger. We had dinner at the Pig n the Whistle down the street and it was great, they were so nice to my daughter even though we were there during Happy Hour. The first time I stayed it was for a Girl's Weekend in the City and we had a corner room with 2 doubles, plus the pullout. It was perfect. We enjoyed breakfast both mornings in the hotel. This stay we had to be out by 7am for the competition. They even held our luggage for the entire day for us, it was a great stay and we can not wait to go back!!

<Content>Great Hotel. Recommend it to Everyone! I go to NY every January for my annual birthday trip and have stayed at this particular Courtyard Marriott 3 times now. I cannot say enough about this hotel. If you are looking for swank and fancy, it isn't that but it is very, very nice and the rooms are HUGE. From what I understand this building used to be a book distributor?? Something like that.... I think that really contributed to the size of the rooms when the marriott took it over. However, important to note that the bathrooms are not huge. It is obviously cheaper to stay in the winter but even at that we ONLY paid $174 a night and for NY that is really, really good. I booked it in either Oct or November on the actual Marriott website so if you are planning a trip, just keep checking their website because the prices can change on a daily basis.Now, the reasons why I love this hotel. First, location, location, location! You are blocks from 5th AVE, Rockefeller Center where the Ice Rink (in the winter only) NBC Studios etc. Time Square. We walk to all of these places from the Hotel. I would say that Time Square would be your furthest point and that is aprox. 15 blocks. If you walk up to 5th AVE and make a left and go up about 10 blocks you are at Central Park. Great, Great restaurants surrounding this hotel. Small, cute quaint places to eat from Italian to Mexican. There is a Starbucks around the corner, a 24 Hour Duane Reed Drug store directly next door and the subway station stairs right in front as well. A Washington Mutual Bank across the street. The Hotel also has Laundry Facilities with washers and dryers and a business center with computers to print your boarding passes or what ever you need to do on the Internet FREE. Free coffee and Tea on that floor as well. A small restaurant and a fitness room that isn't too bad. Only disappointment is that they closed the Bar/Lounge when I was there in Jan 2007. No longer a place to have coctails in the hotel but there are plenty of places to go right up the street. As you can tell, I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved this hotel, will definately stay here again. Booked this hotel because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. The reception area is very small and when we arrived it was very busy but the reception staff were excellent. Our room was large with free internet access, it was exceptionally clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We were able to check in at 8am and as our flight home was at 7.15pm we were allowed a late checkout without extra charge. We were offered a taxi to the airport and we paid 51 dollars for a limo!I would definately recommend this hotel and we will certainly be booking this again when we return to New York for Christmas.

<Content>Best quality/price in NYC I booked two rooms last February. My wife, my daughter and I stayed in one room and my sister and her friend who were visiting from Europe stayed in the other room. The hotel location is great. The lobby is deceiving compared to the rooms which are nicely appointed, large for NY standard and comfortable. The bathroom is nothing different than your typical hotel bathroom but with more amenities. The room was large enough to have a king size bed, a pull out couch and a table without feeling tight. And they do not charge more if you use the pull out couch. The bed was comfortable and pillows smelled fresh. The staff was very friendly. This is the best quality/price hotel I have ever found in NYC. Two nice French restaurants nearby - Le Bateau Ivre - www.lebateauivrenyc.com/ - and Le Montparnasse - montparnasseny.com. They serve brunch too.

<Content>Just like the reviews Having read all the reviews for this hotel, we were worried that it couldn't be as good or as cost effective as it sounded. It was! We stayed from 24-27 Feb and had a pleasant stay. Our room was a good size, comfortable beds and spotlessly clean. The staff were all helpful and friendly. The subway was close by so it didn't matter that it wasn't right next to Times Square, and we prefered the quieter location. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet with freshly cooked waffles and omelets. If you are looking for a hotel with a really large lobby area, lots of lounges and fancy bars etc etc, this is probably not the hotel for you, although there is a small sitting area with computers etc upstairs. We would definitely stay here on our next trip to New York

<Content>No place better. My husband and I stayed here from Feb. 21st to the 24th. We stayed at another hotel last year and the Courtyard was far superior. The room was large, clean, quiet, and comfortable. We stayed on the 24th floor which made the street noise unnoticable. Staying on the east side is a definite plus. The streets and the restaurants are not crowded as they are midtown west. It is easy to get around the city by subway and the concierge can help in telling you which line to take to get to other areas. You can walk to MoMa, folk museum, St. Patrick's, Rockerfella plaza, NYC library, 5th ave. etc. We will definitely stay here again next year. One hint, book early to get the best rates. I found the marriott site to give the most upfront information about the price. A lot of other services and hotel sites tack on addtional taxes and fees which actually make a low rate room end up being almost the same in total,

<Content>Great Stay, Great Location Have just returned from a great stay at the Courtyard New York Manhattan. I was travelling with my husband and two step-daughters and we wanted a hotel that was conveniently located, reasonably priced and with large enough rooms for us all to share (to save some money). We looked on Trip Advisor and decided to look on the hotel website due to the very favourable reviews. We managed to get a room to sleep the 4 of us (2 queen beds and a sleeper sofa) for $270 a night (incl taxes). We thought this was very reasonable for the 4 of us. I asked for a high floor room which is what we got and it had great views of the Chrysler Building and the UN Building. The room was very spacious and the beds were comfortable which is very important when you're spending all day and night walking around the city.The staff were very friendly and kindly reserved us a town car to take us back to JFK. This only cost $55 including the toll. You pay $45 just for a taxi and that doesn't include the toll so it was nice to travel back to the airport in a little more style.We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as we preferred to try out some of the cafes in the city.At night we walked down to the Pig and Whistle pub which is about 200yds down the road and there was a really good buzz about the place. You could eat there too and the range of food was fine, but you're not talking gourmet. It was very reasonable for the price. We also ate at the Outback Steakhouse one night when we didn't want to walk far after being out for 12 hours during the day. Again, the food was very nice and reasonably priced. We did all of the touristy things whilst in NYC, including the Sex  the City tour which was really good fun. Not for men though (my husband went to the pub) and not suitable for anyone under 18 (if you've seen the show you'll know what I mean). If you want a good time with the girls you'll love it. We also went to see Chicago on Broadway which was fantastic. We shopped till we dropped and went to Soho to do some serious shopping. My step-daughters both bought pairs of UGG boots which are half the price you pay in the UK. With the pound doing so well against the dollar, it's worth going across the pond just to pick up some serious bargains!! Anyway, we had a fab time in New York, we will definitely return and would not hesitate in staying at the Courtyard again.

<Content>Marvellous stay at the Courtyard We spent 7 nights with 2 adults and 2 teens at the Courtyard from 25/2 to 3/3Breakfast buffet is extremely good value for money. We took the Continental Buffet which came out at 47 USD for the 4 of us !!! Incredible. Some places in NY, but also in Europe dare to ask the same price for one or two people. (I spend about 40 nights per year in European hotels for business trips)Subway - literally 10 steps away- takes you to all the right places in no time. As said before : this is not located in the middle of the theatre or clubbing scene, but we weren't looking for that.Definitely top marks from us. This hotel deserves its place in the ranking.Compliments for the very friendly staff at reception desk, concierge and breakfast buffet.(Oh, and we also had the white stretch limo to take us to Newark. The kids thought that I had arranged it, but I has just asked for a cab... what a way to go)Kids loved it, we loved it. We will be back !

<Content>Great stay and service for newly married couple. We stayed at the Courtyard Midtown East in NYC from 2/27 - 3/2. Great stay; the location is about six blocks from Rockerfeller Center and the 53rd St. Subway entrance is steps away from the hotel doors. We initially asked for a corner room on a high floor and when we checked in, we had the high floor, but no corner room. The hotel was sold out the first night of our stay, but I inquired about the room change and received it without any issue the next morning, on a higher floor. Our room itself was great - comfortable bed and a very spacious room for NYC/Manhattan standards. Clean as could be. Ask for a corner room if available - it is framed by windows on both the east and south sides, making for great city views from a high floor. Familiar and local restaurants  bars (Chipotle, Houston's, Qdoba, Pig  Whistle Bar) are within a block of the hotel, Outback Steakhouse delivers to the hotel until 10PM also. More upscale restaurants are a 5 - 10 minute cab ride away to the theatre district and upper east side. The hotel is close enough to nightlife to be convenient, but not at Tourism Central, either. Also, a block away from the famous Buttercup Bakery, and a few blocks away from the Roosevelt Island tram where you can get great pics of the Queensboro Bridge and the skyline. A 24-hour Duane Reade drug store is also next door to the hotel, which was really convenient for buying drinks and snacks. Only minor issues are that the free Internet service is slow and the mattress sheet bundled up a few times - again, very minor things. Pretty decent gym with free weights also - those who work out while on the road know that free weight can be a rarity at a hotel gym. The hotel lobby isn't a place where you'll want to hang out or socialize, but it's well-maintained. To top it off, we were going to take a cab to the airport and they offered the services of a white stretch limo for the same price as a taxi. Great way to leave an impression on a departing guest. We'll definitiely stay there again.

<Content>Loved It! Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Courtyard Manhattan Midtown East - FABULOUS HOTEL!!!!! There were 4 of us - 2 moms, 2 16-yr-old daughters - and we had plenty of space. We had two queen beds and a pull-out sofa which we only used as a place to hold our stuff! There was a ton of room for our 4 huge suitcases plus shopping bags, and the bathroom was absolutely fine. We were on the 29th floor with a beautiful view of the Chrysler Building and the river - plus, it was so quiet up there! The service was excellent, and there are several restaurants close by that have free delivery - we ordered from a deli our first night and had delicious salads and sandwiches for a very reasonable price ($25 for the 4 of us!). There's a Duane Reade pharmacy right next door and Essa-Bagel 2 short blocks down the street. The subway station is 1/2 block away, Museum of Modern Art a short walk, and fantastic shopping up 3rd Avenue. I highly recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!

<Content>met my high expectations Had a very enjoyable stay. Staff was very friendly - front desk, doorman, wait staff at restaurant. Was able to find a reasonable rate via Travelocity. Had breakfast in the Cafe on the 12th floor - breakfast buffet was $17, but very good. Utilized parking through Marriott and that was very convenient. They park the car for you, and give them 30 mins and they will bring your car around. They went as far as to stand in the street to make sure you are able to pull out of the spot. Had a corner room on the 28th floor, which had walls of windows. Room was very nice sized, especially for NYC. There were 2 thermostats and could adjust heat/AC easily.Will stay here again, as long as I can get a good rate!

<Content>Convenient and Easy This hotel was great--as someone who finds NYC to be quite intimidating, this hotel was anything but. The staff was super-friendly; checking in and out was a breeze; the room was huge and very clean; and the fitness center was great (and free--the hotel website says there's a charge to use it, but there wasn't).Located in a quieter area, but just a short walk to Times Square and Rockefeller Center with plenty of restaurants and shopping all around, we had a great time! I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Absolutely loved this hotel... We booked this hotel after seeing great reviews on Trip Advisor and having seen it rated as 7th out of 300+ hotels. I have to say that we weren't disappointed at all. The location was great for sight-seeing (3rd Avenue, 53rd East) with Grand Central Terminal and the Chrysler Building just a few blocks away. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was exactly how we thought it would be...we booked an Executive King Suite and requested a high floor and a corner room. We did indeed get a high floor (15th floor) and a corner room which was light with great views around us. The room itself was big with a very comfortable bed, great bathroom and powerful shower. The room was cleaned every day and clean towels left daily. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel...it was lovely to relax in our room after a hard day's shopping and sight-seeing! There's a nice, cosy Irish bar (O'Neills) just a short walk away (3rd Avenue, East 46th-ish) with a relaxed atmosphere....if you don't fancy venturing far from the hotel after a busy day it's perfect. On our last day, we extended our check-out time to 1pm and after that they kept our luggage locked up safely and organised a great, spacious car to take us to Newark airport for 66 dollars. If you're going to New York I would definitely recommend this hotel. Fabulous!

<Content>Wonderful stay, a bit off the main drag We chose to stay at the Courtyard Marriott Midtown East when we went to NY for an American Girl weekend trip for our daughter. The hotel was nice. They allowed us to check-in and gave us our room at 1030am. We stayed up on the 19th floor so the noise level was minimal unless a fire engine or police car went by. Our room was spacious and very clean. The hotel itself is about four WIDE blocks from 5th Avenue. Between 5th and 3rd are Lexington Ave, Park Ave, and Madison Ave. and with a four year old, they were LONG blocks to walk. The hotel is convenient to the 6 subway line and the E line which will take you right to Penn Station. We were very happy with our stay at this hotel.

<Content>Good stay at the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Midtown East My family and I stayed at the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Midtown East for 3 nights from 3 January 2008. We booked two rooms, which were nicely decorated and reasonably spacious with nice bathrooms and separate vanity areas. The only downside was that the rooms weren't interconnected so it was a bit inconvenient having to go in and out of each room via the hallway. Hotel is in a very good location - subway just a few steps from the hotel. Free use of computers and internet in the business centre was very convenient as was the guest laundry. The staff were very friendly and the Concierge particularly helpful. We ate breakfast one morning at the restaurant on the 12th floor, which was good but the Concierge recommended the Madison Diner on the corner of 1st and 52nd or 53rd (can't remember which) so we ate breakfast there the next couple of mornings - nice fresh food and good value!Overall, had a very good stay at the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Midtown East and would definietely stay again.

<Content>Fine but to noisy (in the left side) No a bad place to stay in Manhanttan. Large rooms and kind service for a good price. Perhaps the only exception in the service is the restaurant where some male waiters insist every day -during a stay of seven days- and several times each day that the 15% service was not included. But the main criticism is the terrible noise of next building's air conditioning (left from inside the hotel). And last all the night AND EVERY NIGHT. On the other hand, rooms lack refrigerator or minibar what makes impossible to keep food and makes necessary to go to a restaurant twice a day. Next visit to NYC we will look for a similar hotel but more calm and with fridge in the rooms.

<Content>The good reviews are justified! I've just got back from staying in this hotel and can completely recommend it. The room (queen) was spacious, and cleaner than any hotel I have previously stayed in. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The 12th floor 24 hours tea and coffee service was fantastic as was the free internet computer access.Location wise, it's ideal. 10 minutes walk from fifth avenue and all the shops. Times Square, Central Park and Grand Central are roughly 20 mins walk away. There is a subway station just round the corner from the hotel and loads of places to grab something to eat. I recommend PAX stores for breakfast and Houstons (below the bookstore a few yards from hotel) for dinner. I'm trying to think of something negative and all I can think of is that the there wasn't a kettle for us tea drinkers and that the hairdryer in the bathroom is pretty weak.. that's it.This was my first time in New York and in a Marriott. I hope I can go back and visit NY again soon. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great place to stay Me and my girlfriend stayed here for four nights from the 10th to the 14th of January this year. I booked this hotel because of the great reviews it was getting on tripadvisor, aswell as the price which was around 500 pounds for 4 nights which is good value for money in New york! The location of the hotel is ideal as it is in a quieter part of the city, but still within touching distancing of times square, central park etc. It is very safe to walk to and from every night, and me and my girlfriend did this several times. Rooms are great very clean and spacious and cleaned daily. Around the corner there is a europa cafe which is good for breakfasts - we went here every morning as its so cheap and really close to the hotel. The staff were really nice to us too, and as we had a late flight on our last day there we asked if we could check out late, which they let us do (at 1pm). Upon leaving to return to JFK they asked us if we had taxi arrangements - i said no so they said they could give us a ride to JFK for 55 dollars, which we accepted. As we walked out we realised they had arranged for a limo for us! really nice way to end the holiday. Great hotel id advise anyone to stay there.

And the bathroom (and shower) were good too.There were a few great places to grab breakfast beside the hotel and thats what we did every morning.The staff in the hotel were helpful, and got us tickets for a show, organised our transfer back to the airport etc. We arrived before check in and although our room wasn't ready our bags were stored and we were free to head to bloomingdales (only a short walk away!!).Would definitely stay here again, only slight downside is no swimming pool, but thats normal for NYC!!

Though not as close to the Javits Center as other hotels, I would never think of staying anywhere else! Free Wireless Internet a real plus! Needed a Refrigerator the first time for some food gifts gotten when visiting family in CT. Called front desk and immediately accomodated, extra pillows etc... not a problem! I had my husband and 3 kids the first time, and there was no problem with accomodating all 5 of us in the more than spacious room. Excellent value for the money! Very good and reasonably priced (for NY) breakfast buffett, with very attentive wait staff.

<Content>Great deal, great hotel, great location My wife and I stayed at this hotel the weekend of December 15th, 2007.We were looking for a good hotel within walking distance of Rockefeller Center, Bryant Park area, etc. Looking to take in the Christmas flavor, but not have to stay dead in the middle of the crowds.This hotel is great. Not only do you get the Marriott name, you get a great location. Close enough to everything that we didn't even need a cab to get to/from the Rockefeller Center area and also walked to Bryant Park and St Patrick's for Sunday mass as well.Close to everything you need, especially around Christmas time.We only paid $375/night, a very good deal for the holiday season.Also, it is close to a bunch of subway lines (if you need to venture around the city), walking distance from a Starbucks at 53rd and Lex (key for me), and free internet (bring your laptop).We will definitely make this our first choice for our next trip to NYC.

<Content>Perfect! I was a little worried about booking a hotel in NY as I had heard that all rooms there were quite small. This hotel however has great rooms with bags of space. On our arrival we got upgraded and even got a sofa in our room and complimentary water and snacks. The bathroom was well equiped, the shower was great as the bath is low down it was easy to get in and out. The heating was great too, which came in handy as it was freezing when we were there. Ladies - in our room there was no plugs near a mirror so I had to starighten my hair without using a mirror, which I was not very good at! The hairdryer is in the bathroom! It is good walking distance to most of the attractions. We got tickets for a downtown hop on/off tour (look for guys in yellow jackets) which passed Ground Zero and Statue of Liberty. We caught this bus from Times Sq or Empire State as these are walking distance from the hotel. I think if you have small children who walk it may be better to stay somewhere further West of the city for walking purposes. The best way we found to get to the hotel from JFK airport was an express bus to Grand Central Station @ $15 each then a quick taxi ride from there to the hotel @ approx. $5. On the way back to the airport we got a private car organised for us by the hotel @ $55 (inc. tips, taxes and tolls). We did this option as our flight was early in the morning.

<Content>Excellent midtown hotel in Manhattan This hotel is very convenient for all New York sightseeing. It's a short walk to Times Square, 5th Avenue, MOMA, Bloomingdale's and Central Park. There's a subway station close by and taxis are both cheap (for UK guests at least) and easy to access outside the front entrance. The concierge recommended excellent places to eat, both nearby and in Chinatown. Try the Oriental Gardens on Elizabeth Street, if you get the chance. The Shula restaurant offers the best steaks outside of Buenos Aires! The hotel cafe on the 12th floor is good for breakfast, though gets busy. Try the Oxford diner/deli on the corner of 52nd and Lexington for great value. At the Lexington entrance, you can see the subway grate upon which Marilyn Monroe posed for publicity stills for The Seven Year Itch.Hotel rooms are spacious and quiet. I stayed there in October as well as just before Christmas. I had good views of the UN Building, The Lipstick and the East River from the 18th and 30th floors. Staff were very helpful and friendly. I'd recommend this as a good value-for-money hotel, near all the museums, shops and sights that make New York such a pleasure to visit in Autumn, Spring and Winter.

I only have great things to say: the place was clean and well-appointed, the room was a decent size (for Manhattan), we got an excellent price (got a pay-in-advance online rate), the king room was nicely furnished and had a sofa sleeper for the kids, and the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. I have stayed at the Plaza and the Palace in Manhattan, for twice as much, and neither gave me a room that was any bigger or better than this. The place even had a great bagel shop across the street! If there was a drawback, it was that the location was a tiny bit to the east of much of the action we were interested in. However, we like walking in Manhattan, and in general the location worked well for us. All in all, this place lived up to the TripAdvisor ratings. We liked it very much and will certainly stay here again!

<Content>Great stay at the Courtyard The Courtyard Marriott is a perfect choice for NYC. It is convenientlysituated for either business or pleasure travel, the rooms are quite large by New York standards, and the staff is both friendly and professional. Al, the bellman, went out of his way to provide directions to the nearest bar showing the Sunday NFL games (out-of-town football fans know how desperate that search can be!) and arrange transportation to the airport. I have stayed in some of the higher-priced hotel brands and boutique hotels in NYC but I would definitely return to this property.

<Content>Perfect location We went up to NYC after Thanksgiving for a three day visit. The hotel location was perfect for walking everywhere we wanted to go, theaters, Rockefeller Center, Fifth Avenue, Grey Line Tours. There were also many excellent restaurants very close by, ranging from bagel shops to authentic Japanese to expensive and nice French. One block had two good Irish pubs! The rooms were typical Marriott-nice with the updated bedding and they were clean. The only complaint I have is that the breakfast restaurant had horrible service. We easily made coffee in our rooms and ate breakfast out at far cheaper and better spots. I would stay here again. Sometimes, allegedly you can get a cheaper rate by calling the hotel and beat the web discount prices.

<Content>Great hotel and location Even though Courtyard is one of Marriott's lower end properties, this hotel was better than many of the so-called four-star hotels we've stayed in. The room was very spacious with a king bed, sofa, coffee table, and desk. The bedding was the same clean, white linens used in other Marriott properties. An added bonus at the hotel is the guest lounge and business centre on the 12th floor, which offers comfy chairs, flat screen TVs, coffee, three computers with free internet access and printers, and you can pick up free WiFi there too. The hotel is conveniently located with subway stops very close by. Within a block or two of the hotel, there are delis, fast food, a 24-hour drugstore and other conveniences. Lexington Avenue is also close by, so whatever you can't find on 3rd, you can on Lex. It's an easy walk back to the hotel from the theater district at night. We really couldn't ask for more from a hotel. It was a great deal on Expedia for under $200. Even though I was tempted to book a name hotel like the W or other boutique hotels, we're so glad we chose this hotel. I'm sure the rooms at these fancy places are tiny and with fewer free amenities.

<Content>Good if expensive for what it offered when we visited We picked this hotel based upon the high Trip Advisor rating and the fact that it was family-friendly. I always find it difficult to give a hotel a rating because the criterion are relative depending upon where you are, with wide variations in quality and amenities across both countries and continents. Make no mistake however, this is a good hotel. Equally, this is no five star hotel. The location, being within a few blocks of Bloomingdales, Saks, Tiffany and the Chrysler building is excellent. The hotel is a fantastic choice for families. The beds are comfortable and the rooms spotlessly clean, bathrooms are functional if not luxurious The views are good (although no sign of the Chrysler Buidling from room 2508 where we were). As described previously, the staff are efficient although by no means exceptionally so.So what is the problem? Well none really aside from the fact that I was paying $600 (拢300) + tax per night for what is a mid-range chain hotel. Perhaps the comparison is unfair, particularly given the fact that we probably visited NYC on the busiest weekend of the year, but I couldn't help expecting more for the money. I have read gushing reviews but where people paid half of this rate or less for rooms here. That would be fair value but we could find nothing on Priceline, Hotwire etc that came close. Perhaps we have been spolied by what you get in Singapore or the Far East for 拢300 (true 5 star luxury).We too got the hotel car back to JFK at $55 inclusive of toll but excluding tip and this was a good choice after the world's smelliest cab on arrival! Also, for breakfast, the hotel kindly recommended Maddison's which is two blocks away on 1st Avenue. We ended up having breakfast there three times and it was a fantastic experience with great American breakfasts (bacon, two eggs and hash browns for $7 with unlimited coffee) and a real '50's ambiance.All in all, I would return to the Courtyard. It's a good hotel and our family enjoyed it but I would not pay $600 plus tax per night for it. If you can get it for a more reasonable rate, do not hesitate to stay there - particularly if you are a family with children.

<Content>I loved this hotel and its location I visited NYC for the first time ever in early November with my sister and a number of her friends. The hotel was booked in advance by another person in the travelling party so I knew nothing about it or its location until I arrived. I love to walk and this was within walking distance of many important sites. It's on the corner of 53rd and 3rd and my sister and I walked everywhere only using the subway on our last day because of time pressures and because our legs had finally given up!The room was a very generous size with a nice seating area and a very comfortable queen bed. Great to have a coffee machine in the room. The reception staff and the concierge were very friendly and helpful.My only gripe is the price but you get what you pay for and this is NY after all, accommodation ain't cheap.

<Content>Good Hotel - fabulous staff Great hotel and great value. We were there over the Thanksgiving weekend, so it was extremely busy.Ok, it's a little light on facilities (none really), but what makes it different are the staff. Every single one was willing and happy to help, and not one staff member we encountered was having a bad day (and you would struggle to find one who wasn't in other hotels). The rooms were good and clean, and the bed was very comfortable. On top of that, the location is really good.All in all, we recommend it!

<Content>Loved this hotel Family of 4, we stayed at this hotel over Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Very comfortable - huge rooms  especially liked free tea  coffee on 12th Floor plus free internet. Great location - subway outside hotel door. Easy to get to anywhere by subway. Some sights walkable, (although Times Square is about 30 mins) but as it was very cold we quickly moved onto subway which was very easy. Also easy and cheap to get to JFK from this hotel by train - take E train to Sutphin Blvd - then Air Train to JFK - total fare $7 per person and no trafffic delays! Hotel stop is 51st  Lexington. There are diners, pubs and restaurants around hotel. Connollys pub/rest is good. The city was very busy with holiday crowds in for sales but we never felt threatened in any way. Subway in NY was no different to anywhere else, everyone was friendly and we had no problems at all. Would definitely stay here again.Travellers to Europe take note - you cannot take any liquids back into Europe - that means NO DUTY FREE from the airport. They will sell you spirits, perfume etc at JFK but when you get to your european airport they will be confiscated. Anything you buy has to be secured in your suitcase - no liquids are allowed in hand luggage so don't buy duty free in US airports.

<Content>Comfortable room, convinient location Hotel is well located, a few steps from the subway, restaurants and attractions. Clean, comfortable, nothing fancy. We had a room with 2 queens and a pull out sofa, fresh towels every day, unobtrusive maid service, a nice view from the 24th floor. The room was quiet and the beds comfortable. We had breakfast at the Comfort Diner a couple of blocks away, better and cheaper than at the hotel. The staff was nice, but not terribly outstanding. We also used the hotel's car service back to JFK for $ 55 ow incl tolls and tip, not much more than a taxi and more comfortable. Our AAA room rate was $ 299 and it was a busy holiday weekend, so we thought that was a pretty good rate for what we got. Would stay there again.

<Content>Great room, fantastic staff, fab location!! Booked this hotel a few months ago for a girls week of shopping, exploring and general fun!We came a long way, all 3 of us are from NZ, so it was great to come to a hotel that was centrally located and easy to walk to all the things we wanted to do.The bell boys were fantastic, if we wanted to know directions, how to use the sub way etc, they were only too happy to help! And they were fantastic at getting us cabs when we needed them!The room was nice and big for the 3 of us and comfy beds. We had new towels etc every day and a paper delivered every day. The only drawback... no onsite restaurant. They have breakfast only and no onsite room service either. But with the location they are in, you are so close to many food places that it wasn't really an issue.Will most definitely be back! Great service at a great price.

<Content>All the kind words are true... but we thought the location is good only if you are there for business. We were there as tourists, on a family trip for 4 nights, and thought it was a bit out of the way. If we were there for only one night, we wouldn't have minded the extra 20 - 30 minute walk to main attractions, but after 4 days, it got old. It was just far enough away that once we were back in the hotel to rest a bit after a full day of walking, it was hard to motivate to go back out and walk the distance to another activity, and there was nothing of interest for a family with kids, close by. I suppose we could have cabbed it..... but if you live in the suburbs like us, there's something special about being able to walk....That was our only complaint, however. Ask for a room with a view of the Chrysler building, and you may be surprised to also be able to see the United Nations. That was very cool and unexpected.

<Content>We enjoyed our stay We have decided to book this hotel for 3 nights based on the good reviews here. No deception at all. First, we were able to get a fair price, $279 per night for a superior room. The room was large, bed very comfortable, A very quiet place as well. We never heard noise from the other rooms or corridor. After our errands in NYC, the place was spotless, everything was in place like in our arrival in the room. Maids service was efficient and discreet. We asked for a fridge when booking and it was there when we arrived.If you are looking for a palace or something very special, this is not the place. But if you look for a great place to relax after an hectic day in NYC, it's a great choice in a great spot.

<Content>No complaints at all Booked one room, through Marriott website, with less than two weeks' notice. Cost: $497 with taxes, but it was the cheapest three star room I could find in midtown.I was only there for one night, but no complaints to speak of Pleasant check-in at ground floor lobby on 3rd avenue at 53rd. Rooms start on the 12th floor and my room was on the 30th with great views of the city roof tops. Many restaurants in the neighborhood - Starbucks around the corner - and a concierge who was very helpful.The room was spotless. Everything worked well - TV, lighting, plumbing. The remarkable thing was that i heard no noise at all from adjoining rooms, the hallway or the city below. Even the heating/cooling was quieter than many hotels. Bed was extremely comfortable.Would definitely recommend to someone, although not at this price.

<Content>Super Holiday Our first time in New York, so we were not quite sure what to expect. We've stayed in Marriott Hotels before and this one maintained their high standard. We had booked in for 6 nights and were very pleased with our choice of hotel and have no complaints whatsoever.The service from all the staff we encountered was first class; always pleasant and courteous. Our room was spotlessly clean and well furnished - it even had a view of the top of the Crysler building from our 21st floor window.We ate breakfast in the hotel 4 mornings - they provided a good reasonably priced choice. There are also many other good eateries close by if you so wish. Free tea, coffee and internet access were available on the 12th floor lounge - this provided an ideal opportunity to have a chat and share the experiences of the day before turning in for the night.On departure the hotel organised a Limo to take the 6 of us to JFK - quite an experience for the kids (young and old). This was actually cheaper than getting 2 yellow cabs.I'd have no hesitation staying here when we come back (I can't wait!).

<Content>Great experience Stayed for one night following a cruise. We checked in very early, thinking we would have to store our luggage, but to our surprise, not only were we able to go to our room immediately, we were also upgraded to a corner unit (#2001). This was a king bed with a sleeper sofa. We called housekeeping to make up the sofa bed for our children and they were extremely prompt. Very clean hotel. Everyone was completely friendly and always said hello. Room was comfortable and included a refrigerator. Elevators very fast. Easy walk to many attractions. Drugstore next door. Would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Great for the price and location Great location and right off the E Train, so it is pretty much a direct shot from JFK. Within walking distance to Grand Central, Park Avenue, Madison, and 5th Avenue. Also, only a few blocks from the UN. The staff was VERY nice and helpful. Rooms were nice and clean, but basic (but who goes to NYC to sit in a room?). The hotel restaurant had a great breakfast buffet and there is a drug store right next to the hotel so you can get bottled water and midnight snacks. I would recommend staying here.

<Content>Great location and service We were in NYC to celebrate our first anniversary and chose the Courtyard because we wanted something a bit nicer than where we usually stay but didn't want to spend $800/night. We've stayed in many Courtyards before and are always happy with the consistency. This hotel did not disappoint. It's in a really nice location, in mid-town not far from 5th Avenue, Times Square, and all the other top tourist places. The metro stop is literally ten stops away from the door which is very convenient, as is the 24 hour Duane Reade that's next door. Right down the street there is the BEST bagel shop, Ess a Bagel, that I would highly recommend for breakfast. Bloomingdale's and Dylan's Candy Bar are not far down 3rd either. We had a room on the top floor. The room was a nice size, with a King bed and a sofa. We asked ahead of time for a refrigerator and that was brought to us shortly after we checked in. The bathroom was nice and all the furnishings looked new. I was a little disappointed with the bathroom amenities - I thought I had read they were from Bath and Body Works but ours were not. Of course the beds (as in all Marriott's) were so comfortable. We also had free high speed internet which is nice (why don't all hotels offer this??) The 12th floor is a little lounge, with free coffee, a breakfast cafe (we didn't use it, so I'm not sure how the food was) and computers/printers which we used to print out our boarding passes.The thing I noticed most about this hotel was how nice the people were. Everyone greeted us with a smile and a friendly Have a nice day. The concierge, the bellman, front desk - everyone was helpful. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>You will not be Disapointed, Fab Hotel As a regular traveller I can assure you that this hotel is just fab! You will not be disappointed, my partner and I stayed here for 4 nights and we where extremely impressed by the professionalism and friendliness of the staff, the room was huge, very clean and was excellant value for money. Couldnt ask for a better location, subway station directly outside hotel, tube via jamaica Center and the Airtrain, very easy and most importantly stressfree only $7 complete bargain. lots of little breakfast diners around the hotel to choose from, try the oxford cafe or the coffee pot. 20 mins walk to Time sq, 3 blocks from 5th av, 10mins to central park, lets face it, when in New York be prepared to walk the feet of yourself, best way to see new york (weather premitting of course). If you want to to some sightseeing may I suggest purchasing in advance a NewYork pass and also the All loops greyline pass, you will see so much and save loads of money. Regards the hotel I just want to say it was a pleasure to stay in such a comfortable, clean and friendly hotel, I have nothing bad to say about it, free internet on the the 12th floor, ice machines on every floor, iron in room. Before we arrived we got an email asking us if we would like and benefit from addtional towels and a fridge which they would assure would be in our room on arrival and no extra charge!Also checkin was after 3pm, but we arrived much earlier than expected and arrived at 12pm, asked if we could leave our bags in reception until the room was ready, only to be told we could have out room early as it was ready, also they gave us an extended checkout to 3pm - result. very accomodating and nothing was ever to much trouble. I have stayed in many of hotels with my job and can honestly say you feel a valued guest here, I have always thought highly of the Marriott chain and have never been dissapointed, the courtyard is of same standard of any 4 star hotel. I hope you have a super time here if you choose to stay here and much as we did. If you have ever stayed in new york before you will know lots of hotels in the city is of poor/average standard and are mini size bedrooms with no room to swing a cat.Have fun and enjoy your tripLeo Neill/Berkshire UK

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at the Courtyard New York Manhattan / Midtown East September 6-9. This hotel is in a great location. We walked all over. There is no need to take a subway or taxi. After reading the reviews on here, I did double check to see if we had sheets on the sofa bed, and we did not. I was able to ask the bell man before he left our room. Other than that, everything was great. The extra towels we had requested prior to our stay were there and no complaints about anything.

<Content>Would recommend Our stay here was very short, we arrived late at night and checked out next day around 1130.The room was very big by New York standards. We had 2 queen sized beds as our 6 and 9 year old children were travelling with us. The beds were extremely comfortable, the noise was minimal from outside, although the air con was noisy.Near the hotel restaurant there is a very well stocked self -serve area for complimentary coffee and tea 24 hrs. This was very welcome after a long journey.We stayed in this hotel as originally we booked 2 nights at the Marriott Residence Inn Times Square .When we decided to add an extra night on to our stay, they could not accommodate us for the extra night. Marriott suggested this Courtyard hotel and we were not dissappointed and would recommend this hotel.The staff are all very helpful and friendly.

<Content>Agree with the rest - great place! There are so many excellent reveiws of this property that I can't add much. My family of 4 including two teenagers stayed here for 3 nights on the 20th floor overlooking the Lipstick building. The room is good size for a NY hotel room, maybe 15 X 25 ft. for the standard two queen with a side chair. It's hard to find queen beds in NYC. These were very comfortable (cushy foam type?) with great linens. Furniture was nice with pull out desk that doubled as a table. Room was quiet with little noticeable outside or neighboring room noise. Nice bathroom  shower, good water pressure  hot water (basics you'd expect in a suburban hotel, but things I've had issues with in other NYC hotels!) There were computers available on the 12th floor lounge. Coffee there but no other snacks or drinks. Washer/Dryer available with free soap from the front desk. Staff was for the most part courteous and helpful. One of the Concierge's had a bit of NY attitude but was able to provide the things we needed. I've stayed at a wide variety of hotels in NYC and for the price you pay you sometimes are suprised at how little you get! While the Courtyard Midtown E. was a bit pricey it well exceeded my expectations for a NYC hotel for my family vacation.

<Content>Great hotel!!! My family of four stayed here from Aug7th thru the 12th and it was a great experience! The hotel location is perfect..not too far from times square(about a 20 minute walk) but far enough away to still be fairly quiet at night. The hotel staff was great and the room was very clean and fairly large. We had requested a small fridge and a high floor and they cheerfully provided both. We used their car service from jfk 75.00 for an suv and I honestly wouldn't waste the money ...the car wasn't very clean and it certainly wasn't the most cheerful of drivers but he was on time and he got us there! The ride back was better and we only paid 55.00 for a crown vic limo. We paid 269.00 per night thru the marriot website for the american girl plan....even though we had no kids with us. This was 30.00 per night cheaper than any other plan we could find and the hotel said you didn't have to be travelling with kids to get the rate so we took advantage of it.

<Content>Great stay in NYC My husband and I wanted to take our two teenagers on a trip to NYC without paying an arm and a leg for a hotel room. The Courtyard was perfect. We had two queen beds and a sofa sleeper in a huge, clean, well-kept room with a fantastic view of the Chrysler Building. The location was excellent with a 24-hour Duane Reade next door and a Starbucks around the corner. There were several eating options within a block or two and the subway was very convenient. We requested a refrigerator, which was brought up to our room before we checked in. We did not have any problems with noise in our room (3102). Housekeeping was wonderful. The service was great... everything was great. I'm a little reluctant to give a really good review because I don't want to let the secret out.

<Content>Top hotel at the heart of New York We stayed in this hotel from 4-9 August 2007.We booked on the strenght of reviews from tripadvisor folks. Thanks all!The hotel is great. I might not have all the bells and whistles of other hotels but it does what is says on the tin - a great room at a great price in the heart of New York.Check in was easy and the rather sparten foyer lead to great lifts and a super room on the 28th floor. It was large by European standards, with 2 Queen beds, loads of space and a super bathroom.Towels were changed everyday and the room cleaned spotlessly.We didn't use the breakfast room, rather got a great steer from the concierge to the Comfort Dinner on 3rd and 45th. Quality breakfast to be had there. The lemon and ricotta pancakes served at the w/end are worth the trip to New York alone.Free internet on the 12th along with free tea and coffee is a bonus.For an English family of four on a budget then the room was a great price at $199 for weekends.Its the right place to stay too as any nearer Broadway and 5th would just be so noisy and busy that you wouldn't get any sleep unless the hotel was triple glazed.

<Content>Great Surprise in Midtown I've stayed in many tiny NYC hotel rooms in the past and didn't have much hope that this one would be any better. Walking through the non-descript lobby, my expectations sunk even further, but upon entering my room, what a great surprise! The rooms were large and comfortable. My room had a pull out desk for my computer (no more feeling like I was an 8 year old sitting at the table) and appeared to be recently updated. The bathroom was much larger than most I've been in in NYC and was sparkling clean. All of the staff, from the bellman who arranged a car for me, to the maids who always stopped to say hello, to the staff in the hotel breakfast room, were unfailingly polite and professional. The fact that this hotel is right next to the subway station made getting around town very easy.You will not be disappointed with your stay in this Courtyard by Marriott.

<Content>Great Hotel and Location I just returned from a New York stay and I would highly recommend this hotel to others. The staff was friendly, rooms were VERY spacious according to NYC standards, clean, and there is a subway station and 24 hour pharmacy right outside the door. Look no further...great spot for NYC visit.

<Content>Perfect for Adventurous Family Our family of six just returned from 5 days/4 nights at Mid-Town Courtyard. This hotel was an excellent choice. I called in advance (spoke with Rohan) to arrange limo transport from JFK. It was on time and right where we were. From that start, everything about the hotel was excellent. Front desk very helpful and friendly, bell captain and concierge were very good. The people working in this hotel act truly happy to help their guests, and it shows. Rooms were very clean. Hotel convenient to subway (our family of six rode without hesitation the whole time), to many breakfast shops, to a lot of sights. The price seemed real reasonable considering our location. Yankee Stadium is must-see(new one being built for 2009 season). For a family extensive menu with excellent prices, try dinner at Bully's of New York. Meat loaf is outstanding. I did the research before going and the hotel and its location and price lived up to what was written. When we return, we would stay here again.

<Content>Friendly Are you a family of 4 visiting? Maybe a business traveler? Then this hotel is for you! Friendly staff, great service, go-happy people, and Outback Steakhouse...what more could you ask for. The size of the room we had was approx. 450 sq. ft. I think the proper name was a Superior King. With the shower and toilet seperated from the sink area, no need to say, Are you almost done in there? The bed was comfy and huge; the next step down from temper-pedic. With the sofa in the room, it gave that feeling of a studio apartment. Well at least for us New Yorker's that is. It would turn out to a sofa bed so if you have family over no need for a rollaway, which they have at no additional cost. I managed to pass a few housekeepers in the halls, and everytime got a friendly salutation. When returning to the hotel a few nights, never in my life have I EVER been on an elevator and got a 'Good Night' from everyone in the elevator with me. It was like something out of a movie. This just goes to show you, that the guests are normal and sane who stay here.Happy Travels!FYI - Quiet rooms too! Don't hear a pip!

<Content>Great sized rooms, good location We spent two nights recently at the Marriott Courtyard. We come to New York about twice a year to visit relatives and would recommend this hotel. It was so much better than the last 3 we have stayed in for about the same price. We had a spacious, clean room with a king sized bed and sofa and desk area. Breakfast was not included as with so many New York hotels, but there is a complimentary coffee and tea service all day on the 12th floor. There are also two computers with free internet access on this floor and we were able to print off our boarding passes for the flight home. There is also an exercise room but we did not use it. The staff were friendly and helpful. There is a subway right beside the hotel for lines E, V and 6. This is the Lexington and 53rd street stop. Cost of metro ticket is $2. If you are just there for a few days you can buy a $10 metro card which gives you an extra ride (6 instead of 5). My husband and I shared a metro card. I went throught first and passed the card back to him and then he went through. I have also bought a 7 day pass when I was in New York for a week and it is good value. We also took cabs and found them to be quite reasonable. We did however spend a lot at restaurants but the food was excellent. We always love visiting New York and are happy to have found the Courtyard thanks to browsing on Tripadvisor.

<Content>Good hotel at a great location I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Midtown East, 866 3rd Avenue from June 19 to June 22, 2007 on a business trip. The location is great 鈥?minutes from my office which is on Lexington Ave and 53rd St. and bang opposite the E,V Subway station on Lexington and 53rd St.It is clearly a no frills business hotel 鈥?however it delivers strongly on its promises. The free Wi-Fi worked very well in the room and the room itself was big, airy, modern and clean (much bigger than some of the other NY hotels I have stayed in). The check-in was smooth and hassle free. They provide complimentary USA Today in the rooms and a limited number of complimentary WSJs at the concierge desk in the morning. While the restaurant serves breakfast in its in-house caf茅, it has tied up with a nearby Outback Steak House for delivery of in-room dining. A colleague of mine who was staying in the hotel at the same time said that she had great difficulty ordering in-room dinner through this process and after being put on hold a number of times, simply gave-up and walked out to have dinner. This being Manhattan, there is a wide variety of restaurants and bars around the hotel. I liked Solera (216 E 53rd St at 3rd Ave) which is expensive and focuses on Spanish cuisine and Grand Sichuan Eastern (1049 2nd Ave) which is moderately priced. Majority of the patrons at Grand Sichuan appeared to be Chinese, which in my mind is a vote of confidence in the restaurant.

<Content>A great choice I travel to New York on business about twice a month and this is one of the first places I check for availability. It is a Courtyard, so services are limited, but it is an excellent choice. The rooms are larger than typical in New York and very up to date. The staff is helpful and the location is very convenient. Stay away from the restaurant. There are so many good places nearby, even for breakfast, that it isn't worth the trouble.

<Content>Very Impressed After staying in some dubious accomodation last time we visited New York, I was a bit worried.We stayed here for two weeks and was able to book a 'long term stay' which meant we got the best room in the hotel at very reasonable rates. We had the King Suite which was huge. It had three built in wardrobes, seperated living area, massive king bedroom, microwave, two tvs and of course a great view.I wouldnt bother with the breakfast on offer, go to 'essa bagel' across the street theyre an institution in NY.Not sure if hes still there but Terry at the front desk was one of the nicest staff weve ever encountered.Its true the courtyard hotels arent as fancy as your normal Marriott but I was still really impressed.The only thing I would say is if its your first time to New York consider staying on the West Side. We did find this location not quite as dynamic as other areas weve stayed in.

Rockefeller center, Chryslar building, Grand Central, Central park, and Times square are all within 10-15 blocks. There is a subway station in the same block as hotel's too. Staff was nice and firnedly.From LGA or JFK, you can take AirTrain to nearest subway station and take train-E. If you get down at Lexigton Avenue  53rd Street station, you're right at the hotel.

<Content>Great Location for us.. Our party of six booked three rooms ... Two by the cruise line, and the other by myself....... This was my 1st trip to The Big Apple and certainly not the last..... The hotel was every thing i had expected, location for perfect and the staff 'Perfect' !!.. We has some problems getting to the airport on the way home (Our limo was a no show) so the hotel took us without question, and must mention that in all the confusion of the missing Limo one suitcase was over looked .......... One phone call from the airport and that too was looked after.....Delivered by 'Will' complete with a smile....... So, Al and friends, a big thank you from John and party in British Columbia Canada.

<Content>Great Stay - Great Location I stayed here with for 4 nights with my family, and two friends who had just flown in from South Africa. The rooms were very spacious and clean and the view was incredible. Location wise, we were able to walk to most of the tourist attractions with no problem and where necessary, had good access to the subway when the legs gave in. My two friends are still raving about their stay here! One item to mention is that even though we were on the 25th and 26th floors, you can still hear sounds of life in the city which takes a little getting used to the first night you go to sleep. Another plus is that there are great pubs and shops nearby. A great stay all round.

Our room had two queen size beds and a sofabed which accommodated our family of four in comfort.The new beds were remarkably comfortable - the first time in a hotel I've avoided that unfamiliar bed feeling where I wake in the night.On check in the front desk staff were friendly and helpful.The Third Avenue location is convenient for shops and sightseeing. We were thankful for the convenient subway entrance within 100 yards in the torrential rain we experienced.This hotel is one block away from the Citigroup tower so there was a great choice of good outlets for breakfast and lunch.Highly recommended.

<Content>Typical Marriott Brand Standards . . . Loved It! Myself and three other women (ages 38-50) stayed at the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Midtown East from 12/2/06 - 12/5/06. I frequent all Marriott brands and found this Courtyard to be at the same standards they hold at all of their hotels . . . GREAT. As a frequent traveler, I prefer and have grown to expect nice rooms for the price you pay.We arrived at the hotel at 10:00 a.m. and was able to check into our room right away, which was a nice bonus since we had been travelling since 6:00 a.m. and was able to freshen up prior to hitting the city.The room was great - and HUGE - plenty of room for four women and all of our luggage. There was a safe in the closet, and all the typical essentials in the bathroom. The room had the new Marriott bedding.The location was great, we did lots of walking, but who doesn't in NYC? Subway is close.As with other Courtyard's by Marriott, there isn't a 'typical' restaurant onsite and the 'lounge' wasn't anything to brag about either. However, there are several Irish Pubs in the area that have great food, drinks, and atmosphere.I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.

<Content>New York City - With Kids!! We origionally planned to visit New York last Christmas, however, our plans changed and we rescheduled for Easter - this meant that we were able to stay for 7 nights instead of 4 for the same cost. Our Children were excited to visit New York and it was a nice surprise to be able to check into our room early since we had been travelling since 5 a.m. British time. The room was spacious, clean and had a safe, iron, ironing board and hair dryer. We had requested a fridge and extra towels and these were in our room on arrival. Complimentary tea and coffee were provided - in the bathroom, strangely but were much appreciated. On floor 12 there is a computer with internet access which I used on the night prior to our departure to check-in to our flight, on line. Tea and coffee also available on this floor.The staff were very helpful, especially the Concierge who helped with all our enquiries and who sold us tickets for the tour buses - you can buy an all loops ticket and travel uptown, downtown and to Brooklyn - although quite expensive we found this a good way to get around as each bus had a guide and some were entertaining - no traffic moves quickly in Manhattan. The night tour downtown and across the Manhattan bridge and back was spectacular even though snow was blowing in the air!! Enjoyed meals at the Midtown Restaurant on E55th Street - excellent breakfast and diinner and just 2 blocks from the hotel.

The staff was friendly.We were very satisfied with our accomodations. As others have said, the lobby is small and the elevators can be a tad busy,but we were never slowed down. We hotel valeted our car. The service with the car was a little pricey, but we felt worth it...

<Content>Large rooms, a little off the path... but still a great safe place! This hotel was a great place to stay! It was a little strange in that the lobby on the ground level was very small because the actual hotel didn't start until the 12th floor. That is where the main lobby and bar..etc were. The rooms were from the 14th to the 31st floors. We stayed in a 2 queen bed room with a sofa. I thought the room was very, very large for New York. A few years ago we stayed at the Waldorf Astoria and the rooms were MUCH smaller than these. I checked the beds for bugs (I'm a clean freak) and all checked out ok. The mattresses were more comfortable than most hotels and we travel quiet a bit. The bathroom was decent in size. The bathroom items actually came from bath and body. A nice extra! My only gripe was that I like to be able to control the temperature in my room. If the OUTSIDE temperature is not 60 degrees, you can't turn on the fan or the air. Sometimes it can be stuffy inside even when it is cool outside. One day it was about 65 outside and our room was hot, but there was nothing that I could do. We paid $271 a night for a couple of nights and $237 for the other 2 and I expect to cool my room when I want. The staff wasn't overly nice when I inquired about it. My other complaint was that they emailed asking if I would like a fridge or extra towels and I said yes to both. Neither were given. And, I asked for a higher floor and received the lowest possible floor. I called 3 times on that request. Other than that, it was a great hotel. It was clean, right next to a 24 hour pharmacy and the subway at 53rd and Lexington. It was very convenient. It was about 5 blocks from Grand Central Station and a short distance from Times Square, Macy's, and many other attractions!If you love to shop, make time for Chinatown! The final bonus to the hotel was that they took us back to the airport cheaper than it cost for a taxi. It was a flat rate. And, the driver was soooo entertaining. He basically gave us a tour or New York with hilarious commentary the entire way. I enjoyed that! And, he didn't drive like a NUT (the cab drivers try to scare you to death). Everything was within walking distance. We walked sooo many miles, but it was easy to get there. You won't be disappointed in this hotel. The staff, for the most part, were nice. The elevators were super fast and there were 6 of them and the rooms were clean. The beds were comfortable. What else could anyone ask for but AIR? :-)

<Content>Loved Our Stay over St Patrick's Day! The Courtyard Midtown lived up to every great review I have seen on Tripadvisor. It was centrally located and one of the main subway lines was 20 steps away from the front door. (You can take the subway E line uptown from Penn Station to the stop at Lexington and 53rd and follow the exit signs to 3rd Avenue.) The staff was friendly and our room was ready upon arrival. The hotel room was very clean and large with a king bed and a sofa-no stains or funny smells. Incredibly comfy bed--no nasty bedbugs(I looked!) and no other creepy crawlies that I could spot. The hotel was very quiet and every staff member we met said hello and asked if they could help us--they told us about places to eat that stayed open late, mailed postcards for us. They also checked our room keys when we walked past the lobby to make sure we were actually staying there-a nice safety feature. In the lobby, they have excellent free maps of Manhattan with clearly marked Subway stops. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NYC-we paid $229/night plus tax which I understand is quite a bargain for the city.

<Content>Lovely hotel, Nice staff I'll admit I am a total tripadvisor junkie. I never book any hotel w/o checking with TA first. I was a little doubting that a Courtyard could be as great as all the TA reviewers stated but I have to say this place was extremely nice. The rooms are large and newly renoveated. And the staff was excellent. I was traveling with my young daughter who became sick while in NYC and the staff were very accommodating; late check out, extra towels, a ride to the airport. It is in a very convenient neighborhood and only a 4 block walk to shopping on 5th Ave. While it was not cheap ($284 plus tax) , I would definitely use this place again.

<Content>Decent deal, good location This is a very typical hotel but the rooms are nicely renovated and we were surprised at the large size, unusual for Manhattan. They don't offer many extras (like no room service or mini-bar), and the doorman was on the take with the airport car service, but with the subway steps away, a 24hr drug store next door and an easy walk to some of the best attractions, we would recommend this hotel for tourists who want location.

We had to take the taxi or subway to get into the city. We stayed here twice because it's a really good size room. Usually rooms in new york city are tiny and expensive but depending on the deal you can get this one for less than $200 a night and that's almost a bargain. The room was clean we had no issues with any bugs or mold or anything gross like that. Everything was clean and the beds were huge (king) and comfy. We had a king bed and a good size sitting area we were put all of our stuff. The front desk was friendly and checkin and out was quick and easy. No problems.

<Content>Great Room Wonderful Stay at Courtyard Midtown East NYC Just spent the weekend at the Courtyard by Marriott Midtown East NYC. It was wonderful. We were given a superior room on the highest floor with 2 Queen size beds and a fold out sofa bed. (We had requested 2 queens and rollaway.) Lots of space, everything brand new and helpful friendly staff. Comfortable beds, pristine linens, lots of feather pillows (you can request non- feather pillows, web site says), big shower with good water pressure. One slight criticism was the only mirrors in the room were in the same small area outside the bath, so it was difficult for all of us to get ready at once. In a quieter neighborhood, so you need to cab or stroll to the major attractions, but lots to explore nearby and plenty of places to eat nearby. All in all ,highly recommended and we wouldn't hesitate to go back again.

<Content>Very Nice Property I needed a hotel for a night and booked this at the last minute. I normally don't stay at courtyards as I have found most had been pretty basic and beat up. Much to my surprise, this property was quite nice. My room had two very comfortable queen size beds, a sitting area and a decent size, very clean bath.Best bang for the buck I have received in NYC, including some of the posh places like the Ritz and Four Seasons. Outside of the room there were not alot of ammenities but then it's NYC, outside the city is full of them. Worth the stay.

<Content>great hotel great location This hotel was fantastic. Everybody told us the rooms were very small in NYC...not our room. We were on the top floor of the hotel with two queen beds and plenty of room...we even had our own foyer!!The room had damp carpet when we checked in. I called downstairs to find out what it was and was told the carpet had just been cleaned and for that inconvenience tomorrows breakfast was on the house!!The front desk staff were all incredibly friendly. This hotel is situated in a very good location. Not far from Times Square, Empire State, United Nations etc. There is a great Brooks bookstore a few doors up and most days we had breakfast at Azure on 51st and 3rd (around $15 for four people for breakfast) and many evenings had some soup or pasta at any one of the Cafe Metro's in town...particularly the one on 51st and Lexington...these cafes are both within 2 mins walk from the hotel. At $169 per night for the middle of NYC...We think it was great value for money and a great home away from home for four Australians at Christmas time....STAY THERE!!!

<Content>great hotel We ended our trip to NY at this hotel, staying here the last 2 nights. I booked the online price with no refund. Got a suite - king size bed with a sofa and table. The bed was soft and comfortable. The goose down pillows were soft, but I don't really like goose down pillows anyways. The room is huge with plenty of space for luggage. Everything was clean and nice. The E, V, and 6 train station is just right outside making it easy to get places. There's a Pharmacy next door if you forgot any personal items, and there's an Au Bon Pain right across the street for cheap breakfast pastries and coffee. I loved this hotel stay.

<Content>Warm Heart in the Big Apple We booked this hotel based on reviews from tripadvisor and were not disappointed. Perfect for a family of four our room featured queen size beds in a large room with sofa. Situated close to many tourist stops, such as Dylan's Candy Store, Sarge's Deli and not too far from Bloomingdales, this hotel was a great base. Quiet, clean and contemporary the premises were complimented by attentive and pleasant staff. They organised a SUV for us on departure as four + baggage was too much for a taxi. It was luxurious and cost effective.The nearby Oxford Cafe and local Pax were great alternatives for breakfast although there was nothing wrong with the hotel banquet. Hotdog and bagel vendors were located right outside for the classic NY experience. Will return again!

<Content>Excellent hotel Just had 8 days at the Courtyard. Have to say excellent hotel. Rooms are larger than we expected (we had 2 beds plus sofa) and everything is clean and new. Location is excellent being no more than 10 minutes walk to 5th Ave. Great subway and bus connections. It's a nice area with lots to see and do. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Really nothing to complain about and we will be going back next year. A few tips - for breakfast go to the Oxford Cafe which is just round the corner. Hotel serves cookies at 5pm which is a nice treat after a round of shopping. Nothing more to say other than very happy customers.

<Content>Our Birthday Gift My parents stayed at the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Midtown East for their joint birthday Sept. 21 celebration where they attended several plays and had dinner with friends. Upon returning home to Florida, however, they discovered they had body lice. In order to get rid of the lice, they had to wash all of their belongings, some being drycleaned, throw away luggage and other items and wash with special lice killing soap.The lice was definately picked up while at this hotel in New York, which indicates to me bad hygene practice by the hotel. I wouldn't want anyone to have to go through this ordeal.And, the hotel won't compensate them in any way for their inconvenience! I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. I hope they can clean up their rooms!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Me and my mum stayed at this hotel for 4 nights over the thanksgiving holiday and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel. The location was fantastic. It was only 10 mins walk from 5th avenue, and 20 mins from Times Square. The subway is close by for those sites slightly further away.The staff were very friendly and made checking in and out extremely easy.The hotel room itself (we had a queen/queen guest room) was huge, and very clean.This was a fantastic holiday, and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel.Just one extra note, make sure you wear your most comfortable shoes if you intend on doing all the sites like we did, by day 4 i could barely walk, but the pain was completely worth it. Can't wait to go back.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel is definitely one to stay in if you are going to Manhattan. Location wise it's close to 5th Avenue and the Rockefeller Plaza, but more importantly the subway is just around the corner, which in New York, means you're close to everywhere. The rooms are perfect, very new, clean and spacious. There were three of us and we used the sofa bed. There aren't blankets for the sofa bed, but we made a quick call to reception and in 10 minutes someone came up to make the sofa bed for us. Free broadband internet access is provided. There is security in the lobby.The hotel is very well staffed. We arrived early (13:00), but there was no issue and no waiting at check in or check out even though things were busy - I've never seen such efficient check in staff.A taxi service is available to JFK for $55, including tolls.There are any number of places to eat within range. Within one block there's Au Bon Pain, Starbucks, as well as a few delis and a Chinese restaurant. A few more blocks and you can have any type of food you want.Price wise it was the best deal in New York at that time, except for those hotels that appear in the low 300's in TripAdvisor ratings.

The location was perfect for business and sightseeing, the staff were welcoming and friendly, and they gave us a VERY spacious corner room. The room was well appointed and MUCH larger than a typical New York room. Will stay here again when possible.

<Content>Great location - just avergae (at best) hotel My wife and I have stayed here on two occasions. We love the location - midtown gives you access to everything incluing subway, shopping etc.Our first stay was on one of the concierge floors (not worth the extra$) in a very small room. The next time we requested a larger room - (well worth the extra$). Hotel is badly in need of an update.Staff was pleasant - as should be expected. Since then we have stayed in at the Hilton (51st Street) - much better value - about the same location.

Good Courtyard We are former NYC residents  this hotel is ideally located to restaurants, museums, theatres, Rockefeller Ctr, etc. Room on top floor had great view  was well equipped. Breakfast included was complete [not continental] w/ cooked to order eggs any style. Hotel has a limo co. available for ride back to LGA for $35 cash including tolls, which is much nicer than NYC taxi. Desk  other employees were very helpful. There is a single computer w/ internet access avail on 12 fl so u don't need to bring ur own to check ur emails, etc.

<Content>Great for your money! We love NYC! My husband and I visited NYC for the first time in early September for 4 days. After looking over one trip package after another and after calling different hotels, we decided to book our vacation package with Courtyard. If you plan to take a shuttle from the airport, remember you are sharing the shuttle and you'll have to make a lot of stops. It may be better to splurge and spend approximately $45 on a cab (without tip) from the airport directly to your hotel. (Just be prepared that anywhere you go will be expensive.) We felt this was a great hotel for the price! However, we did not get everything that we wanted when we booked the package. There was no refriderator in the room and the air conditioner was a bit confusing (it stayed really cold the entire time). So call in advance to make sure you get the amenities that you asked for! There was a coffee maker in the room, but no cups! However, there are two great eateries within a block from the hotel (PAX and a little store on the opposite corner) for great late night snacks or a quick breakfast! The bed was comfortable, the view was fun, and there was free internet in the room. It was very clean, especially the bathroom, which was so nice to return to after going to public restrooms. In addition, the room was quiet and ask to stay on a high floor so you cannot hear the street noise as loudly. The staff was friendly and helpful and we will stay there in the future. There were so many things to see in NYC that we didn't stay in the hotel much. You walk everywhere in NYC anyway, so plan to spend 15-30 minutes walking from the hotel to anywhere (walking = 40 min. to MET, 15 min. to UN, 30 min. to Times Square or to a Broadway show, 20 min. to Rockefeller Center, 20 min. to Central Park). However, there was a nearby subway entrance if you are not up for walking.

<Content>Pleasant Stay at Courtyard Midtown East Spent 2 nights at the end of August. The usual outstanding Marriott service. Having arrived a little tired and wishing to dine close by the desk clerk, Terry, suggested an excellent Italian restaurant that was obviously popular with locals and frequent visitors. Our room was very large, nicely furnished, and quiet. Actually the room was so big it could have benefited by an easy chair to go along with the sofa. Very conveniently located to a subway stop on the corner which we used to get to Yankee Stadium, Broadway theater, and uptown musuems.

<Content>Loved the hotel You don't have to worry about this hotel, from the greeting at the door, to the checkout we had nothing but positive encounters with all the staff. The rooms are gorgeous, recently redecorated. The breakfast is wonderful. We had a limo back to LGA for $35 from the conciger (sp). We should have requested one for arrival. The four of us paid $68 for the airport Blue Shuttle. The Hotel is close enough(within 6-8 blocks) to most sites if you like to walk. The subway is on the corner. We used the taxi's mostly and never paid more than $6.00 for any ride for the 4 of us. The staff will let you know about how much for a taxi to where you are going. The most we paid was for a Limo to Central Park for $15. It was kind of fun. The Grayline tours are worth every cent , We took the classic tour. We also took the tour to Washington DC from Priceline It was $149 a piece but also was worth every penny Our guide was great. We can't wait to go back to NY and see what we missed in the 5 days we were there. We reserved our rooms on the Marriott site and got a better price than through Priceline or Orbitz or Cheaptickets.

There is a great bar two blocks up called the Pig N Whistle, good irish bar. Times square is a 10 minute walk as is central park and fifth ave for all you shopping needs. The breakfast buffett is nice but a little expensive (20.00). Loved it, will go again. Staff was great too! Saty in upper floor and get a two queen bed room, its huge compared the other rooms. Bye

<Content>Nice hotel with a friendly staff I stayed at the Courtyard Manhattan East while on business in NYC during May 2006. The staff was helpful and very friendly throughout my stay. I paid $239 per night. There were freshly baked chocolate chip cookies at the front desk each afternoon. My room was an average sized and very clean, appearing to be recently remodeled. Like another person said, there is a bit of noise from 3rd Ave. (I was on the 17th floor) but not enough to keep a sound sleeper like me awake. The subway is very close. NOTE: Don't be afraid of the subway! It is VERY easy to navigate, maps at the entrance of stations and you can always ask someone. $7 a day on the subway is a great deal. Your feet may be sore after all of that walking. I will stay here again.

<Content>nice hotel We just got back a few weeks ago from New York and loved everything about it. This hotel added to our awesome experience. We were not able to check in early, however the hotel staff gladly stored our bags for us. The rooms were very nice and everything from the carpets to the bedding was new and clean. The staff was not overly friendly but they were efficient. The cab fare from JFK to the hotel was around $55.00. The hotel arranged for a town car to take us back to the airport on our departure date. (I recomend taking advantage of this service.) Also if you are going to New york for the first time, do what we did and go buy greyline bus tour tickets for your stay. You see so much of New York on a double decker bus. We loved the tours because we didn't have to pay cabfare all weekend and we received a lot of neat info during our siteseeing. Anyway, I highly recomend this hotel and when I go back I will be staying there again!

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at this hotel with my Mother-in-Law for three nights from May 4-7, 2006. We were in New York to see a couple of shows. The hotel was clean, the staff was courteous and helpful and the room was a nice size room. We had two queen size beds in a non-smoking room on the 24th floor. The beds were very comfortable. There was some street noise from Third Avenue but I was so tired after walking so much, it didn't bother me for the most part. I left a couple of dollars for the cleaning staff every night and they left me a thank you note in return which I wasn't expecting. The subway is on the corner. A friend of my mother-in-laws took us to Brighton Beach one day and we took the subway home - it was really easy to get around this way and an experience for me. We also took the subway to Canal Street (Chinatown) - lots of touristy type things to buy here and plenty of people trying to sell their wares. The hotel staff flagged down taxi service for us to the opera and to the theatre (if you haven't seen Wicked it is fabulous). We did not eat in the hotel but they have free coffee on the 12th floor which we did get everyday. We ate breakfast at Azure which is about two blocks up the street (lots of variety). You can walk up to Rockefeller Center easily as well as St. Patricks Cathedral. When you are in New York you need your walking shoes wherever you go unless you take cabs or the subway everywhere. We took the subway to the nearest station to The Metropolitan Museum and walked a couple of blocks. The Jewish Museum is about 10 blocks up the street at 96th street. Getting a cab in New York is an experience in itself. We used a limo service to get to and from the hotel but there are probably other means we just didn't check this out in advance. I recommend this hotel highly for a clean, convenient, safe place to stay with a great staff. We paid $201per night - being inexperienced I thought this was a good rate after comparing prices on line.

<Content>Excellent value in a good location The Marriott Courtyard represents an exceptionally good deal for a hotel in a convenient location in New York. It has a functional reception area which has little more in it other than reception, waiting area and concierge - there is a bar and breakfast area on the 12th floor but it being New York we had no need to use this. Our (standard ) bedroom on the 21st floor was exceptionally large for New York with a sofa, coffee table, safe, coffee maker, ironing board etc. The bathroom was fine, although not large, with a shallow bath which could only really be used as a shower - cleaning each day was very good.The area is just off Lexington Ave, near the metro and within walking distance of 5th Ave, Rockerfeller Centre etc. Lots of good eating in the area. Would definately go back there given the location, the good room rate and the efficiency of staff. If you want lots of atmosphere, a fancy hotel lobby etc.- then its not for you but if you want comfort, convenience, good housekeeping and excellent value then the Marriott Coutyard can't be faulted.

<Content>Quite Nice We stayed here five nights in early April. This is not your typical Courtyard, but is a 30+ story building. The place has just been renovated (in fact, the restaurant only reopened our last morning there).The rooms were excellent, clean and fresh, with great mattresses and wide screen TVs.Almost all the employees we encountered were friendly and helpful, but watch out for a concierge named Sara, who apparently is inexperienced (she gave us some bad directions that resulted in us getting off the subway two stations past where we should have, which led to a 10-minute walk in the rain to where we needed to be).The hotel's location is outstanding, at 3rd Ave. and E. 52nd St. We walked most everywhere (Central Park, American Girl Doll, Carnegie Deli, Times Square, etc), never for a minute feeling unsafe.The hotel was pricey, but probably not by NYC standards.

Very clean and large. The bathroom was huge, maybe because it was a room designed for handicap. Nothing to complain about. We wanted a late check out for 2PM and they could allow us for 1PM, so we got 1 hour more than the usual noon.

It was newly renovated, well presented, spotlessly clean with two very comfortable double beds. Each member of staff who we came in contact with during our three night stay were friendly and very helpful. We appreciated the provision of a safe in the room where we could securely store money etc. The location was perfect 52nd Street, 3rd Avenue. We were easily able to walk to all of the major attractions except the Ellis Island area. To visit Ellis Island and the statue of Liberty we took the subway from the entrance located close to this hotel. We went out to breakfast each morning at a deli only a few doors away where we enjoyed great food and service. If I were in New York again I would, without hesitation, go back to this hotel.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I stayed at this hotel for four nights for the Marathon weekend, got a great deal because I booked early however, Marriot allow you to cancel at short notice without charge so there is zero risk.The rooms were extremely large and clean for a City Hotel and that was what attracted me the most.The position is 15 minutes walking to Broadway but there is a subway on the corner just outside as an alternative.Staff are polite and helpful and plenty of options locally for pharmacies, book stores and restaurants/deli's etc.Would not hesitate staying in this hotel as it is far better value than staying on broadway.Would suit families as well due to the larger rooms.

<Content>good,friendly and excellent for families. We arrived at the courtyard manhattan not sure what to expect. My room cost (queen, queen room) booked directly with the hotel via their website was 150dollars(approx).This included all taxes and charges, which was excellent for new york, although I did book last April to get this rate. Our room was on the 19th floor.When entering the room on one side is a large double mirror wardrobe, with an electronic safe{free) and the bathroon was on the other side. The bathroom was quite large withe all the usual things!! and a hairdryer, and very clean. There was a coffee maker in the bathroom.Our room was an excellent size, especially for New York. We had 2 queen beds, sofa and occasional table,television,fridge(also free) and a large work/office desk and chair.The housekeeping was also very good. Plenty of towels,coffee, and bedding was changed each day. We choose to leave a tip each day rather than at the end of our stay, as there seemed to be different girls working each day.Both our check in and check out were very fast and efficient. I don't know what we had expected from a New York hotel, but all the staff were very friendly, and we would stay here again without a second thought.Being on 52st east, and third ave, we were able to walk everywhere, and there is a store directly beside the hotel entrance for snacks etc. There are also lots of eating places near by.There is also complimentary coffee on the 12th floor lobby available 24 hrs, and a guest laundry in the 21st floor(soap powder and fabric conditioner is available at the front dest..also for no charge.All in all for the price we paid for this hotel we were more than happy with our stay.

<Content>Nice Place! We stayed at the Courtyard Eastside in early December 2005.The hotel was very nice and while average elsewhere, the rooms were huge by NY City standards.We had a room on the 19th floor on the north side facing 53rd St and had a great view of the former CitiBank Building and 3rd Ave.We arrived around 5:00 PM on a workday so the valet was a bit backed up and nobody came out to unload our bags but otherwise there were no complaints about the staff and service. Another important point is there is no pull off for the hotel at its entrance on 3rd Ave and there are only two temporary spaces on the street for check in. If you drive, you may have to double park for a few minutes while you check in and get the valet. The room was solid and there was little noise from within the hotel or the street.And of course there are plenty of places to visit in NYC but for we Irish Americans, PJ Clark's historic pub was less than a block north on 3rd! It is Guinness heaven!

<Content>Friendly staff, Decent Location, Large Rooms I would not rate the hotel itself as above average, except to the fact that the service was great! Everyone was so nice, from the check-in to the bellhop to the housekeeping, etc. I have absolutely no complaints about the service. As for the room, we were given a handicap room since it was the only non-smoking available and it actually didn't turn out to be that bad since the room was much bigger than any other hotel room I have been in - in NYC. It was also minimally decorated, but clean. The location was decent, in that it was walking distance to Central Park, shopping on Fifth/Madison area, yet during the weekend, the area around it was not too exciting and some places were closed on Sunday (i.e.Starbucks). I would have preferred to be near a little more action. However, cabs were easy to come by, which was a plus! There is a great bagel place 2 blocks south (Ess-a_bagel) that was great to have close-by! I would stay there again for the price (I booked a room at $279 which was the cheapest I was able to find for a 3+ star hotel in Manhatten without staying in the downtown) and the service.

<Content>Great service and overall good hotel We had a two night free stay at this hotel. The stay was a good one. We were able to get early check-in and the staff was EXTREMELY friendly and helpful. The rooms were nice and the hotel was very clean. Our maid service was out of this world. I am kind of a messy person (especially when living out of a suitcase for week) and the maid service cleaned our room spotless after the first night and even took the extra time and care to straighten out our shoes and papers (maps, tourist stuff) on the desk and made the room look outstanding. The location was decent. It was right by a good subway station and fairly close to alot attractions (Times Square, Central Park, Rockafeller, 5th Avenue and etc.), but I would not say the location is great. We stayed at two hotels in Manhattan during our stay and if you could chose between this and the Hilton New York (Midtown) I would take the Hilton 100 times over, but this hotel was not bad either.

<Content>Nice location, average hotel Spent a night at this hotel during President's week. Since it was a free night on points I really can't complain much. However it was not up to marriott-even Courtyard standards.Check in went smoothly although the lobby was drabby looking. Actually the entire hotel can benefit from a major renovation. We were on the 16th floor. The room was clean but plain and unattractive. The beds were low and not very comfortable.The valet parking costs $41 and you need to request your car 30 minutes in advance.Good things- Location was very good. We walked 6 long blocks to see hairspray (great show). We walked 5 short blocks to Seredipities and 5 blocks or so to NBC studios.Staff was friendly.Bottom line-If you want a plain. clean and fairly priced midtown eastside hotel-then the Courtyard is fine. If you want something more- choose The Marquis or the Hiltons, and Sheratons for a few dollars more.

<Content>Good location This was a great choice - it was rather inexpensive for NYC and it was clean, comfortable and in a great location. My sister and I stayed here for 2 nights before Christmas - and we were able to walk everywhere - Macy's, Times Square, Rockefeller Center etc. The staff suggested we eat close to the hotel as it was not as touristy and therefore cheaper and not as frantic. We had great meals and great drinks at the various establishments close by (a Mexian restaurant, Irish pubs, and even an odd Karayoke/Italian place). Everything had a nice neigborhood feel. The only snag was that the parking is valet and they park the cars in a garage several blocks away, and we ended up having to wait over an hour for our car. But, they offered to credit us one day of parking and apologised many times. Overall, I would say this is a great find and I will stay there again.

<Content>Nearly perfect I stayed here for one Saturday night in January 2005 during a theater trip. I liked everything about the hotel. The room was spacious, clean and quiet. The staff was exceptionally friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet was minimal but a good bargain. My only disappointment was the bar/lounge closes at 10 p.m. I like to have a drink after the theater. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Stellar service under extraordinary circumstances I agree with other reviewers--great location, proximity to subway, shopping, room size/amenities, but most of all staff. We stayed here in August 2003, checking in only minutes before the big blackout. The staff was PHENOMENAL during the whole adventure--grace under pressure, friendly and reassuring, smiling and joking, though many had been working well past their original shift. They used the in-room intercoms to keep us informed early on, when no one was sure what was going on. A whiteboard in the lobby kept up with what areas of Manhattan had power, water, etc. Pitchers of ice water in the lobby, glo sticks when we got back to the hotel around nightfall, breakfast as best they could the next morning. Best of all, backup power (?) meant room keys worked and one elevator (manually). So we were allowed back up to our room the first night. Yes it was hot, but in the days ahead I heard of guests at other (MUCH more expensive) hotels having to sleep on the sidewalk. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Not Bad, but could have been better for the money My 14 year old daughter and I and my dear friend and her daughter just returned from NYC. We paid, including taxes over $300.00 to stay here for one night. It was one of the lower cost hotels that had at least a 3 star rating. It was in a pretty good location. For $300 buckaroonies...we had no sheets or blankets for the sofa bed and had to call down to housekeeping for them. It took a couple trips for them to get them to us. We also asked for pillows. Then we noticed when hopping into bed, that there was no blanket under one of the comforters on one of the double beds. So, we had to call again. There was no hair dryer in the room and when I called housekeeping, they doubted me and tried arguing the point. They had to come and see for themselves that there was no hair dryer in the room. So, they did bring me one. The room was clean, only a little noise from the outside because we were 20 stories up. View wasn't the greatest. Shower was fine. Beds were as hard as a rock!!!! Pillows too. For $300, and the reputation that Marroit Hotels have, I think it could have been better. The restraunt was ok. $14.95 for Buffet breakfast. Waitress was overly nice. Scrambled eggs a little watery, but the cook is superb!!!Checkin and checkout, no problem. No security in the hotel. Anyone could of walked right in and up without notice. I've paid less at a Luxury Walt Disney World Resort Hotel and got better rooms and service, transportation included. I did notice a big thing while in New York City. The people are as nice as they can be. I had visited back in the eightys and people were not as friendly. So, if you want a hotelwith no problems,and at least a three star rating, consider somewhere else, and I'm guessing the price will be even higher. New York is definetly expensive.

<Content>Great Location....Fantastic Service. This is probably one of the cheapest Marriott Courtyards in New York and should not be looked down upon. The location of this hotel is great, only a brief walk to great sites and to the subway station. Around one corner is a police station, and at the other is a pharmacy/grocery store. This is an older hotel and our room was comfortable but did need updating. The staff is great and their attitude is pleasant and very helpful. There is a good restaurant on the 14th floor that services brunch (great). I would return to this facility again.

<Content>it was great My husband and I stayed there from September 17th for one night to attend a broadway show. It was in a good neigborhood and not too far from the main attractions. The staff were courteous and very helpful and the rooms were clean an nice. I would recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the attractions but not in the heart.

<Content>Can't wait to go back My wife and I stayed at the Courtyard from Sept 4 to Sept 6, 2004. We went to the yankees game on the 5th and they won by the way. This hotel is located in a great location near everything. The room was much better that we expected and was very clean. The breakfast at the hotel was excellent. Last of all the staff went out of their way to be helpfull and courtious to us. I recommend this hotel highly.
