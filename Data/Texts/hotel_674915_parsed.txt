<Content>Excellent accomodation and service We have just returned from a vacation week at the Desmond Tutu Center in New York, set in Chelsea neighborhood. The room was cosy and spacious. The complimentary breakfast served inside a wonderful historical refectory. The staff friendly and willing to support us in our daily needs.Chelsea is a little bit out of the action, but with the buses M11/M10 and the A, C, E subway lines we were easily back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel (10th Av with 23rd st).

<Content>lovely stay in the Big Apple What a lovely place to stay in the hectic city! We enjoyed our room,though the hallways are pretty narrow.The recently renovated rooms are sparkling clean and you have everything you need at your fingertips.The real winner was the breakfast each morning at the refectory. Lovely stained glass windows,wood panelling and all sorts of selections left nothing to be desired.Cereals,breads,yogurt as well as cooked to order omelets gave us plenty to eat before starting out on our explorations. It was a few blocks to the subway, but they are through lovely streets with brownstone homes on each side. This gave a feeling of being in a real new York neighborhood, away from thousands of tourists.Highly recommend!

<Content>Perfect retreat After a hard days trek around,NYC everyday this was a fantastic place to return to day or night away from the rush. Nothing was to much trouble for the staff,the breakfast was a delight. The subway is a 5min walk to 23rd St, or the walk into the main area of manhattan can be a 25 min stroll. There are plenty of bars and restaurants in every direction within 5 mins. A perfect retreat

<Content>A wonderful find A great location and wonderful find. This is a simple hotel without a lot of amenities. It has been open less than a year. Rooms facing 10th Av are noisy, but we asked to be moved and were given a wonderful, quiet location for the remainder of the stay. The breakfast that is included is outstanding, the staff nice and helpful, the rooms comfortable and clean. Its a few blocks to the subway, but we weren't bothered by the walk. We will definitely stay here again. This is well above average.

<Content>Great place to stay, but.......... We have just returned from a fantastic 8 day holiday in New York and stayed at the Desmond Tutu. A lovely hotel, great location, but we did experience a few problems. We booked directly with the hotel online. No Standard or Deluxe rooms were available so we booked a Superior room. On arrival we were allocated room 303 and found it to be very small, too small for 2 adults. We contacted reception who apologised and explained that the room was incorrectly labelled on their system. We were transferred to room 306. Later we called by reception and asked what was the grade of room 306 (it was larger than 303, but still could not be described as roomy). The receptionist confirmed that it was a Standard room. We agreed to stay in this room (we didn't want to move a 3rd time), but naturally be charged the Standard room rate. On checkout our bill had been modified, but we were suprised to find that we were charged just $30 less each day. We queried this, but were told that this was correct. I have since found evidence online that we have probably been overcharged and have contacted the hotel. Our only other problem was with the room servicing. One day our room was not serviced at all and we had to contact reception on an almost daily basis for supplies (mugs, creamer, towels, toiletries etc). Having written some negative comments I would still recommend the hotel. The staff were friendly, the hotel was clean and comfortable, free internet access, a fab complimentary breakfast from 7-9 a.m. (10 a.m. at weekends) and an ideal location with some lovely restaurants close by.

<Content>Perfect gem  When we arrived we were not sure to arrive at a hotel, but everything was OK. A very comfy room and a great breakfast in an incredible room (refectory), although it was served pretty early (between 7 and 9)... When we arrived we did not know the hotel was so close to so many nice shops, restaurants and bars. Marimoto, The Park and Craftsteak are just around the corner. Highly recommendable!

<Content>Close to Perfect We checked into the Desmond Tutu on Saturday, September 6th. The lobby was very nice on the inside. We had to ring the buzzer at the door to be let in. The front door stays locked, but there is someone at the desk 24 hours. The staff was very friendly. We stayed in room 308 on the third floor. The room was incredible! It was so modern and clean. The bed was so comfortable. It had four fluffy pillows and a down comforter. The bathroom was very clean, and the hotel supplied Bath  Body Works toiletries. The room was so much larger than typical NYC hotel rooms. The hotel offers free breakfast, but I can't comment on that as we ate breakfast out both mornings. There is a great diner right down the road from the hotel called Empire Diner. There is also a really good bakery with awesome cupcakes called Billy's Bakery. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the subway. The nearest subway is at 23rd street and 8th Avenue. The hotel is in a very safe area. We came back to our hotel room after midnight every night, and there were always plenty of people around. They keep the gate around the hotel locked after I think 10pm so you have to buzz the gate to be let in. Again, there is always someone at the desk so they buzzed us right in everytime. We only had one minor problem with the hotel. We took a nap on Saturday before our seeing Avenue Q. We put in a wake up call for 5:30pm, but they never phoned us. Thankfully we woke up on time anyways. We also put in a wake up call for Monday morning to catch our plane home. The desk did call us on time that morning. Maybe they just got confused with the 5:30 in the afternoon wake up call. Who knows? The only other advice I have is if you're a lite sleeper, request a room on the back side of the hotel. Our room was on the front side and faced a busy road. We could hear trucks driving by at night time. Luckily, the noise never interrupted our sleep. :o) All in all the Desmond Tutu was amazing! It was an awesome find for $ 199 per night. I can't wait to go back!!!

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Desmund Tutu Center No doubt the Desmund Tutu Center is a great place to stay. Spent a whole week in New York with the family and appreciated in particular this original hotel, part of a historical complex. Not too big (approx 60 rooms), situated in Chelsea, in the neighborhood of restaurants and retail establishments, not too far from a subway station, it is an oasis of silence. The style of the hotel is very contemporary and stylish, the rooms are clean, large, fully equipped and beds are very comfortable. Last but not least, we were impressed by the kindliness and helpfulness of the personnel. It's defenitely a place we'll be going to again

<Content>Best place we have stayed in NYC We stayed three nights at the Tutu Center via Quikbook. Got an amazing deal - an average of $199 per night. Unfortunately, prices have almost doubled since we booked so we probably won't have the privilege of staying there again. There are so many great things about the place I don't know where to start. First, the neighborhood (Chelsea) was so charming and peaceful compared to somewhere like Times Square. There are many, many Zagat rated restaurants within a few blocks walk. We loved Rocking Horse Cafe (Mexican) and Negril (Jamaican). There are also a lot of cute bars and coffee places. The Chelsea Market (home of the Food Channel) is also within walking distance. The Chelsea Museum is worth a visit.The hotel itself could not have been nicer and the staff was wonderful. Sylvia let us check in early and was so kind and hospitable - love you, Sylvia! All the staff were great. They booked a car service for us back to Islip airport and we had no problems at all with that. The rooms are larger than the typical NYC hotel room and have very nice bathroom amenities (Bath  Bodyworks). Breakfast in the Refectory was a pleasure. It is a beautiful room with high ceilings and stained glass windows with classical music playing in the background. The hotel also has a small unadvertised fitness center - nothing much, but at least a few things. There are also gyms in the Chelsea neighborhood if you need something more elaborate.If we get a good deal we would very happily stay there again.

<Content>A pleasing place to stay A surprising find, the name was a little misleading 'Centre', not hotel/BB/Inn - but generally very pleasing. Very close to Chelsea/Meatpacking district - in fact getting around was very easy. The room was quite well done - simple, plenty of nice touches,a nd details. Breakfast was simple, like dining in the the Hogwarts dining room - but hey ... when there are so many places to eat breakfast all around - its no problem. The wireless in-room internet was PAINFULLY slow. Would I stay there again? - yes, definitely.

<Content>Deal in the City! Stayed here Memorial Day weekend. I hesitate to write this because this is a small hotel; I want to go back and I don't want it to be full! Our room was large, immaculate, stylish and new. All mod cons - flat screen TV w/HBO, BBC America; A/C; CD radio; great toiletries; good-sized, well-lit bathroom; fancy coffee maker, etc etc. Hotel complex is just beautiful. Friendly staff. Good, fresh, generous complimentary breakfast (top quality smoked salmon and fresh bagels from Brooklyn!). All this was a STEAL compared to other NYC hotels that charge more but offer you so much less. The hotel is in a quiet, safe area of Chelsea; we faced the road (10th Ave) and still got a good rest. There are some diners nearby. There is a good restaurant we tried up the road (Red Cat). The area also borders the fashionista meatpacking district/hot nightclub area. And was $10 cab to the Village.Cons, all of them minor: A bit of a trek to the metro (3-5 blocks). Ongoing construction outside. Difficult to locate entrance to the hotel (no signage!). Check in at 3pm and our room wasn't ready at 2pm. Check out at 12pm and no exceptions. But we'll definitely be back!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel  We stayed here over Memorial Day weekend. Our room was so cute, beautiful, and perfect size. The room was very clean. The breakfast was good enough; really good coffee! The bed was so comfortable we didn't want to leave. They are doing a bit of construction outside, but looked to be done soon. Very few ppl in the city are familiar with this hotel; it is kind of hidden. Don't miss the beautiful garden area outside the hotel; sooo relaxing. The thing I have to say is it is a bit of a hike to the nearest subway stop; about 4-7 blocks depending on the line you need. We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it!

<Content>Gem in Chelsea NYC visitors from Vermont, May 26, 2008My husband and I just returned from a Memorial Day weekend in NYC. The Desmond Tutu Center and Hotel exceeded our expectations. The accommodations were comfortable and the decor was very tasteful. Our room faced the courtyard in the back of the Center and was accessable, during the day, giving us a bit of nature in the big city. Be sure to make time to go out and take a stroll around the grounds. A continental breakfast was included and it was excellent. Everything was so clean and pleasant. If you want a change of pace in NYC--modest, clean, quiet, and AFFORDABLE--the Desmond Tutu Center is the place to go.

<Content>Very Pleasantly surprised... Saw the hotel review on this site and decided to give it a try - it was very reasonably priced for Manhattan, so i expected the worst.I arrived 6 hours late, but was met with a warm welcome after midnight, and concern for my tiredness after so much delay. There are renovations going on at the Hotel, so the building work started fairly early in the morning. This was not a problem for ME, but is worth mentioning. Theroom was huge - a whole corner of the building. The bed was one of the most comfortable I can remember sleeping on. The rooms are all period with high ceilings, many original features, and mod cons e.g. TV aircon fax, modem etcThere were 24/7 diners on nearby corners, although the hotel offers complimentary breakfast. The area is quiet, but you are 2 blocks from the Subway. It is a local area with friendly shops and take--away food outlets. Front Desk staff were welcoming and most helpful.Very pleasantly surprised and highly recommended, especially at this price.

<Content>Great location and room Perfect hotel for travelers seeking something with more charm than the usual business oriented place, and not the hipness of the boutique hotels. It has a perfect location for art lovers, with everything that is important in the contemporary art scene starting at the other side of the street. Walking distance to great restaurants, as well as one right next door. Walking distance to meatpacking district. Reservation through internet with ahead pay, without any problems. Room was huge, clean, with good beds. Very good value. Free WiFi. Staff was helpful, breakfast in an old church-like refectory. It was the first time my wife went to NY, and I was happy this hotel turned out to be this way. Only place I will return to.

<Content>A very pleasant surprise As a former resident of NYC, I walked by the building that houses the Desmond Tutu Center many times wondering what was inside. I'm glad I've finally had a chance to see it. Partially on chance, I ended up booking a room there on a night that most of the city's hotels were sold out. I paid $325/night via Quikbook, which by NYC standards is on par with a 2 1/2 star hotel along the lines of a Hampton Inn (and higher than what some others have paid since mid-spring is one of the peak seasons for visiting). I usually prefer boutique hotels, and the hotel's decor was a little too inoffensive for my tastes, but it's about on par with what you'd see in an upper-moderate chain, e.g. Westin or newer Hyatts. Unlike most chains, however, it came replete with a 32-inch LCD TV!My room was, judging from the fire-escape map on the door, one of the smaller ones, but thanks to its high ceilings and larger-than-normal width, it felt larger than most of the NYC hotels I've stayed in -- and it's definitely the only one I've seen with a fireplace in the room (bricked up, unfortunately, but it's a nice decorative touch). It was spotless and appeared to be fairly new (which, judging from the other reviews on here, I imagine it was), and I definitely appreciated the free wi-fi and breakfast. It's also nice to see a NYC hotel room with an air-con system that isn't a window unit. There's no true on-site restaurant, but the excellent Cookshop (which serves lunch and dinner, as well as brunch on weekends) is directly across the street, and some of the city's best restaurants (Del Posto, Craftsteak, Buddakan, Old Homestead, etc.) are less than a five-minute walk.Downsides: it's a bit of a hike to the subway, and certainly much more of one than you typically see in a NYC hotel. The Center is the only hotel in this area of town, aside from a sleazy by-the-hour place a few blocks south, and it's great if you're visiting to check out the galleries in West Chelsea or the shopping in the Meatpacking District, but the closest subway stop is at 23rd  8th, a good ten-minute walk (admittedly through one of the city's most pleasant residential neighborhoods, with stately Federal townhouses and the like), and although there's a bus stop nearby, I wouldn't expect many non-natives to learn how to navigate the routes. The hotel has great soundproofing, but it's nonetheless right on 10th Ave., a route that gets a decent amount of bus and 18-wheeler traffic, so definitely request a room facing the back if you're sensitive to noise. (My room faced the avenue, and since they were sold out that night I couldn't change it.)The hotel's renovations are ongoing, and Lord only knows when they'll finish up all the work out front, but I'd definitely have no hesitation in recommending the place.

<Content>Perfect for a NYC Getaway! My husband and I stayed at the Desmond Tutu Center for a long weekend in April. If you want to stay somewhere out of the way of tourists, then this is the place for you. We certainly felt like residents of the City. Plus, it's so inexpensive by Manhattan standards.The hotel is a bit camouflaged right now because of the continued rehab of the building, but don't let the construction put you off. The rooms were modern, spacious, and comfortable. We had some problems with the air con unit, but it wasn't unbearable. Rooms facing 10th Street can be a bit noisy, so if you are not used the city noise then request a room away from the street. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfasts in the peaceful refectory were a welcome start to the day and allowed us to stay sufficiently filled until mid-day. After breakfast you can stroll around the courtyard and even browse the very tiny seminary library and the gorgeous chapel. The location is excellent if you want to explore a different side of Manhattan. The Tutu Center is two blocks from the hub of comteporary art (galleries galore!) and only 3 blocks from the Chelsea Market (amazing food and the home of the Food Network). The Meat Packing District (also 3 blocks away) is home to many famous 5-star restaurants (T. Colicchio of Top Chef, M. Batali, Morimoto).Another treat is to take a walking tour of the Chelsea Market and Meat Packing District by a group called The Foods of New York Walking Tours. An excellent 3 hours was had by all. Overall, the Tutu Center is one of the best places we have ever stayed. We will certainly return, although I fear the prices will rise once word gets out!

<Content>Best Hotel in NY - PERIOD. WOW! Perfect location, very friendly staff, and very good rate for St Patrick's Day weekend. (about $220 everything included).The room was bigger than my first apartment - I challenge you to find a room bigger than this for under $1,000. New, sleek, modern COMFORTABLE furniture. An actual working fireplace in the room, but I don't know if they let guests use it. Charming chair and reading lamp was just beautiful. The windows overlooked a playground and courtyard, and it was almost silent during our stay. We were right next to the elevator, and didn't hear a thing. Big flat panel TV, plus DVD/VCR unit. The sitting area had a really comfy couch that I slept on w/o any problems (but I am only 5 feet /152cm tall), fridge in room so you can have your own food in there. The bathroom was HUGE - probably 8x11ft/ 2.4m x 16.7m?) and also had a window that you could open . It was nice to get real fresh air in, not some noisy, useless fan.The only drawback was that the complimentary breakfast ended at like 9am. It should go to 11 at least, but most US hotels end at 9. Boooh.Anyway, I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It was far better than the Waldorf and Sheraton in every way.

<Content>Good hotel in nice location We have just returned from NY, had a confortable stay at Desmond Tutu Center. As other travellers have mentioned, the hotel offers good value for money at current prices, and it is conveniently placed for public transport, only two stops away on the underground from Times Square. The area is very nice and safe, and it's a 10 minutes walk to the underground. The rooms vary in size, we had a very small one, while our friends had a much bigger room for the same rate. Ours resembled a big cupboard, with only enough space to squeeze in past the bed and no lights on ceiling, only two or three desk lamps, which made it difficult to read in the evening. The bed is confortable, nice linens, and nice touches in room, with tea/coffee machine available, water, toiletries in bath etc. I phoned the hotel direct to book and got a decent rate, but then I noticed a much cheaper rate on the hotel website. I contacted the hotel by email and got the lower rate confirmed. There were also a few problems at check in, we asked for a room away from the street (10th Avenue can be quite busy and the hotel is next to the road), at which point the receptionist asked me if I wanted to cancel the reservation and go and find a better hotel! (very rude, she was a supervisor, as well!) After some convincing, she agreed to transfer us to another room, but then she made us wait for another hour before she dealt with the forms. After travelling for 12 hours, this wasn't the welcome we expected, but then the other staff were all nice and we had a good stay. Breakfast offers a good choice, but no cooked food, probably due to building regulations, it includes smoked salmon, boiled eggs, bagels, pastries, a selection of fruit and fruit juices, teas, coffees etc. There is a nice choice of restaurants in the area, we found two nice ones, Don Giovanni down the street from the hotel (5 mins on 10th avenue) makes fantastic pizza and offers a selection of other dishes, and the Greek restaurant on corner of 9th avenue with 23rd street, with a more modest decor, but an excellent selection of nicely cooked meals at very decent prices.

<Content>Good Enough for a Night or Two There are, apparently, a fair number of hotels in NYC that are converted day hotels, schools, convents, etc. The Desmond Tutu Center is one of them. And along with that comes some compromises - smaller rooms, narrow hallways, fewer amenities. But overall it's not a bad place to stay for a night or two.The rooms are, as said above, small. But comfortable enough. Traveling alone on business I never felt crowded; but I don't know how you'd put 2 or more into the room without stepping all over each other. Bathrooms are equally small, as you'd expect.The public spaces are inconsistent. There is no lobby to speak of. But the rectory, where they serve the complimentary continental breakfast, is spacious and cool. Hallways are narrow, but bright.As stated there are few amenities. No room service. No workout facility (the printed material says they have one, but I couldn't find it. They offer discount day passes to the gym down the street). Complimentary breakfast with decent selection. Free wireless, which is nice but the connection tends to drop every hour or so. Service is good. I showed up fresh from a redeye to find that they canceled my reservation as a no show. When I explained that there should be a note in the file about my redeye arrival the front desk person simply said I'll just reinstate the room. The property is in Chelsea, a ways away from the hustle and bustle of Midtown. I initially felt like I was staying in the hinterlands, but am not going to complain about the quiet.Not entirely sure I would stay here again on a holiday trip. But may consider it on business.

<Content>Wonderful Place I only booked my trip to New York last minute, but I was very lucky to find a deal for this hotel as I had a fantastic stay there.Yes, the hotel is not quite finished yet, but please do not let this put you off. Outside still looks like a building site, but inside is fantastic and will look wonderful once the work is finished. The staff were friendly and the room was wonderful. Nice and big, the comfiest bed I've ever slept in as well as a few nice extras such as a big tv, plenty of towels, tea/coffee and free breakfast. The free wireless was handy too. The hotel is also in a very safe, handy location and is no more than 10 minutes walk from the subway (8th and 23rd st). Ok, it may seem a little rough around the edges right now, but I would reccommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>A great start The hotel is lovely -- the rooms are spacious and well-appointed, the historical aspects (ie the fireplace and a delicious, way-better-than-expected breakfast in the refectory) are great, and the furnishings are well-chosen and comfortable. Like others said, a few kinks to work out -- early a.m. construction noise, some odd stains on the door, etc. -- but I'd absolutely stay here again. Fabulous!

<Content>A great start I stayed at the Tutu center a few weeks after they opened. The rooms are new, beautiful, large, and nicely appointed. Because the building is quite old, the rooms have much of the old character: fireplaces, original moldings, etc.The service was responsive and professional.The outside front of the hotel (a fountain I presume) was not finished, and looked like a construction site, but so does much of New York. It was not noisy.This would be a five star review, except that, as with any brand new hotel, there were some minor unfinished parts of the remodeling, kinks in the service, etc

<Content>Sloppy service, a catalogue of errors! We pulled up outside the hotel to find that it was still a building site. The reception area, in addition to being half-built and smelling strongly of vinegar, was just like a student campus - miniscule, no sitting area, no decoration and no doorman. You would expect more given the price of the rooms. Although we had requested a room on a high floor (in anticipation of noise from the street) we were allocated a room on the first floor. The room was small, there was no carpet in the hall way and it was cold. In addition, we weren't too impressed with the building site view and were worried that it would be noisey. We asked to change rooms and were given an inward facing room on the fourth floor which was much better - the view was very pleasant and it was quieter. The room had certain defects though. Firstly, there were coat hangers, but no rail to hang them on. Secondly, the safe was not in any way attached to anything making it totally pointless. Thirdly, the bath was dirty and stained with building debris. There were also tissues in the bin and hairs in the bed and we weren't confident that the room had been serviced properly.The next morning we had a visit from the maintenance staff to inform us that the heating guage wasn't working properly. Not great given how cold it was! The water was lukewarm for the first three days making showering a miserable experience. On two consecutive mornings we were awoken by the fire alarm, which sounded continuously for about 10 minutes on each occasion. When we called down to ask what was going on the staff were unfriendly, unapologetic and unsympathetic. These wake-up calls were very disconcerting and not the best start to the day!We experienced a number of other problems during our stay. When we arrived, we both received quite strong electric shocks from the buttons on the lift and it was out of order from our second day onwards. There are no minibars in the rooms, however, there is a modern coffee making machine (although we were only given one mug). The cleaning staff forgot to service our room on one of the days, despite us having been out all day. We called down to notify reception of this - there was no apology and they came up with the ludicrous suggestion of changing us to another room which had been serviced! What were they thinking - who wants to waste their evening packing and unpacking unnecessarily?!In summary, the rooms are generally modern and well appointed. However, unfortunately the catalogue of problems we experienced, coupled with the indifference and ineptitude of the staff, was incredibly irritating and blighted our stay. Maybe this hotel will improve in time but we certainly would NOT recommend staying here in its present state.

<Content>Nice try We stayed at the hotel the day before the grand opening. We booked 4 rooms through Expedia for a business trip. The check in process was not smooth. I arrived a little after 3PM and the front desk clerk said she wasn't sure if my room was ready and asked me to sit in the waiting area (small) More than 20 minutes later, I went back up to the desk because no one, including the MOD bothered to come back over and inform me of the status. I was sitting less than 10 feet away.When the rest of my party arrived, they had lost one of the pre-paid reservations. They did straighten that out in a timely manner and blamed it on Expedia.The one female in our party was put into a room with no blinds, no curtains, and no phone. The top issue of our stay happened when we returned around midnight. One of our party returned to his room to find that they had placed another guest in there while we were out. Imagine his surprise to find two of the entertainers for the following night's gala in his room. It took until 2 AM for the hotel to straighten out the situation.While everyone at the hotel was nice, no one ever offered to do anything for our inconveniences. They will really need to improve their processes and service to survive in the NY market.
