<Content>lost cash It was a ok place to stay as hostels go, as it was more a hostel than a hotel, staff seemed pleasent and helpful. Unfortunatly i could not reccomend this to anyone as i checked out and left my passport behind and wallet with my 拢s in it,(in my room) when i realised and returned to the hotel a hour later it had been handed in by the cleaner, i was so releved to get my passport i didnt realise the 拢70 that was in the wallet had been taken, not untill i was on the plane home, as it was left in the room and i locked the room before i handed the key in i can only assume there is disshonest staff. I phoned hotel and basically i was told tough luck. so dont use this hotel if your on a budget coz anything could go missing! I was hoping to return in the future but never again and i would not suggest anyone else did! good luck, and happy travelling!

<Content>Fairly good for a hostel in Amsterdam We stayed at the Hortus for one night mid week in August. It is a hostel rather than a hotel but has double rooms too. We stayed in a private double room which, as other people have said, was fairly small. It's a few minutes walk outside the centre but that means it has the advantage of being in a quieter area. The doors are fire doors so can be a bit noisy when people are coming in and moving around at night and toilets and showers are shared but that's pretty standard for Amsterdam. It's pretty good value for the money and has the advantage of breakfast, eggs on toast, provided in the morning which was more than most others in the same price bracket.

<Content>Pretty Sweet Place - Biggus Willus For 拢65 for 3 nights, Its a sweet place, we had 6 in a room, all bunks, and our own shower. Shame we didn't have our own toilet, but having our own shower was a big benefit. Room was clean, big windows etc.... the breakfast was a bit [--], eggs and toast, but there are plenty of bakeries down the road.The big problem was the stairs very very steep and dangerous we were on the top floor, and had 3 flights of stairs to climb..... twisty and steepthe area is the plantage bit of amsterdam, tram goes right past, to centraal etc.... Albert heijn supermarket a few minutes walk etc, and the red light district 10 minutes away, its a very safe and quiet bit of Amsterdam, famed for its Artis botanical gardens.plus the hostel has 2 pcs which are handy to use and on all night..If I go back to amsterdam i'll defo be staying here again, cheap and cheerful...

<Content>Ok for short stay This is definetly a hostel, not a hotel. We had a private room which was clean and comfortable. The shared bathrooms were small and probably the worst we have seen on our travels. Good breakfast for the price and pleasant staff, although they made you feel uncomfortable using the kitchen facilities. Bit of a walk to central town, but could catch tram. Overall good for the price.

<Content>Student Stopover Cheap and cheerful is the best description. A hostel, but a with seperate rooms, which made it better than a hostel. Rooms were ok, basic but with a sink and mirror, we had a shared shower which was ok, ive been in worse halls of resisdence and some did have en-suite. Staff were very friendly, with the attitude of 'do what you like, just clear up afterwards' and you were always greeted in the morning with 'would you like schum eggsh?Free internet access, a pool table and beer vending machine made it all quite livable. Its in a good location, about 20mins from dam square in a safe neighbourhood, with some nice resturants and bars close by.For 拢30 a night, I wouldnt stay anywhere else.

<Content>Great value hostel There have been a lot of bad reviews of this place, and having stayed there last weekend I can't understand this at all.OK, it's not actually a hotel it's a hostel, but a very quick look at the Hortus's website makes that obvious.My friends and I had 4 rooms in total, all of which were spotlessly clean, as were the bathrooms. The breakfast was the best hostel breakfast I've had (and I've stayed in a lot of hostels).The staff were very helpful, and gave us loads of directions and tips on where to go.Towels were available (you just had to ask), the beds were ok and had linen provided. The bar area sold beer from a vending machine for 1 euro which was good when getting back from a night out and tea and coffee was free 24hr.Yes, the stairs were steep. WELCOME TO AMSTERDAM!! All the buildings have steep stairs, that's how they were all built! Even after many drinks I managed not to fall down the stairs.You're paying less than 30 euros per night, for that I think that hotel hortus is fantastic value and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Perfecgt for a bunch of friend in their 20ies Let's be real,you do not want to take your loved one in this rat-hole. At the time we used to go,few years ago,they did not even provide towels in the rooms,you had to go in the back of the house in this sort of boiler room and pick an old but clean towel from a full stack of them left years before by some other visitors.The rooms are VERY basic and many of them don't even have a bathroom,just a sink an that's it.As said,if you are a bunch of good friends in town for some real Amsterdam fun (you know what i mean) this is the place to be.It did not even bothered us that you haver to take a short 15 minutes walk to the warzone (you know what i mean,again).Staff is rude at times.

<Content>Hell On Earth on first impressions when you get out side the hotel it looks like any other hotel in amsterdam but when you walk in to the hotel its a different story. The rooms are not fit to keep rats in they have sick stains on the carpet the beds have fleas in them and they are bent in the middle from the fat people that have stayed there.when we arrived there the light in the room did not work and it took 2 days for them to fix it. The shower flooded because the plug hole was full of crap. and in some of the rooms the plaster was falling off the wall and in some cases it had already fallen off. If you have any trouble with walking you will not be able to get up the stairs because they are so steep (we struggled and we are a group of college students). some of the staff are ok but some are so busy on their computers they have no time for their customers. the breakfast that they advertise on their website is an egg if you are lucky! and some bread if you are down stairs early enough. there is on fire exit and it is in on of the rooms so if there is a fire you have little chance of getting out. if i could give this place a lower rating i would. i think it is the worst place that i have ever stayed!!

<Content>Relaxed atmosphere! I've stayed here a few times and I really like it for the money! 25 euros per night and that includes breakfast 2 eggs, toast and all the coffee you can drink all day. The rooms include clean sheets! The stairs can be a pain when you are up on the upper levels. This place is more like a hostel but the staff is always nice!

<Content>Love the Hortus I stayed at the Hortus from 11/17 to 11/24/2006. If you want swimming pool, tennis court, 5 star dining facility and room service the Hortus is not for you. If , on the other hand, you want a clean room, comfortable bed, extremely helpful and friendly staff, then the Hortus is your hotel. I will make it my business to stay at this Hotel for all future visits to Amsterdam and I will recommend it to all friends.Althought it is not in the town center there is a tram line (#9) which runs, at very frecuent intervals, right next to hotel, The Niewmarkt and several tourist attractions (Hortus Botanicus, Artis Zoo, Jooden Museum and Rembrandt Plein are within walking distance. By tram the Central Station is only 10 min. away. Stay at this hotel, you will not regret it.

<Content>Do not contemplate visiting this place We stayed here for one night for the Holland versus England friendly football game and i can honestly say it is the worst place i have ever had the misfortune to stay in. I have stayed in plenty of poor places during my travels over the years both watching England and on holiday in General. This place was disgusting! The room was tiny with a set of bunkbeds that were filthy with rotten torn mattressess and smelly pillows. We both woke up the next morning covered in bites that required anti-histamine tablets!!!! The room was at the top of three horrendously steep flights of stairs and the shared bathroom and toilet facilities left a lot to be desired. The best thing that i can say about this place is that it had a nice relaxed atmosphere. I did not go to this hotel for that, i went for a nights stopover in what i thought would be at least half decent accommodation after reading some of the reviews on here.I am certainly no prude and generally know what to expect when staying at the cheaper budget places. This was a really bad place that we decided on and i would not want anyone else to go through what we did after visiting this place.I would not reccomend this place to anyone. We got another hotel the next night, for the same price (Amsterdam House hotel Eureka) and it was a palace compared to this. Go there if you can it is so much better.

<Content>Excellent for price! THE hostel is a bit out of center-mile walk maybe. Tram and metro very close. Nice Staff-clean rooms. Other guests were a bit noisy-but area was quiet and pretty. Everything surrounding hostel is much cheaper than in the center. PROBLEM: we booked online and when we arrived Hortus told su that they were overbooked-gave us 100 euro and sent us to another hostel in the center. That was a bit annoying, but it worked out all right. We also thought we would have our own bathroom-but instead we had a private shower. But, I am actually planning on staying there again-it was just such a good price and pretty area.

<Content>Perfect location, Good Price I stayed here with my girlfriend here last august, booking was very conveinient. On the map it seemed like a way from the centre, it really wasn't, 3 minutes on the tram from central station and only 15 minutes walk even in a right state! about 5 minutes until you get by shops/bakeries etc then another 5 to the edge of the red light district and coffee shops.It's right next to the Hortus Botanicus and Zoo, and on a couple of main tramlines, near some nice cafes, a couple of small chilled grassy areas/parks nearby. the hostel has a back yard that gets some sun. Cool front room with all sorts of sporting memrobilia, a pool table, bongs, free internet access.The rooms are the only slight let down due to having thin walls and can sokmetime be a bit noisy if someone is getting their end away (luckily the guy in the room next to us was a one minute man so only kept us awake for a second!!) but theyre clean, the one we stayed in was a decent size and had a semi-decent view. I've booked to go back for a whole week during the world cup.Right i'm rambling now, but basically there are some whinging people who have rated this place, who expect the ritz for 拢19 a night. Don't listen. I HIGHLY recommend the Hortus due to value for money and superb location. If you don't fancy drug dealers on your doorstep but having all the action within 10 mins stumbling time this is the place for you! See you at the Greenhouse!

<Content>All OK by me Myself and seven friends stayed in an 8 bed room at the Hortus for five nights. OK, it isn't the most glamourous hotel and is probably better described as a hostel rather than a hotel but it would perfectly adequate for most travellers.The room had enough bunks to sleep twelve, a sink, shower and table / chairs and sofa. This meant we were able to relax in our room as well as in the common room area downstairs.The common room area has a couple of vending machines (which sell beer) and a pool table as well as Sky TV and plenty of seating. The hotel is quite large and I would imagine that at peak times of year the common room could get pretty busy but it was alright while we were there and a lot of guests stop in for a last few smokes before bed and to watch some TV.Smokers will like this hotel as you can smoke in your room as well as in the common room area. Soft drugs are tolerated throughout.The price was the biggest bonus of the whole thing, I paid just under 拢90 for my five night stay.

<Content>Hortus....dissapointed I would describe my experience to hortus in words...Noisy(extremely noise from shouting doors and wooden stairs where people going un and down,you wake up from that noise every morning)Inpolite behaviourthe only gentle person of this place was the blonde russian girl Cell roomsI had a double room with my boyfriend and i feel like being in a prison,dont even think to try it if you have clistophobia....the good points was the cleaness..but the grey carpets and the unfriendly atmospere make that place bad for a youth hostel..next time i would pay something more just to be in a better hostel

<Content>Happy at the Hortus The Hortus is a cheap hotel but so comfortable and pleasant, it takes the edge off the concept of budget tourism. Our room was big and clean and comfy, even if the bathroom and shower were in the hall. All the shared facilities were clean and inviting. Breakfast was both cooked (eggs) and self-service, but ample! Location very convenient to Jewish landmarks in particular.We loved it!

<Content>not good hotel hortus was clean..the staff was polite but in their own worlds the rooms was small and like cells...my room was absolutelly like prison....the breakfast was not good...and furtermore the last day when we pay we gave 54 euros for a double per day then 50euros we knew and they had told us...!!!!also i can say that the true word of this place is hortus miserable...no any funny atmospere or a celebration or even something that will make you feel nice(things that are musts at youth hostels)..i will not also forget the doors of the rooms it was something like a war and you couldnt sleep at least one min..when they close are shouting like bombs. i was asleep when one door closed... a mizery place to smoke downstairs with football channels...if you want to feel like prissoner is the best place..and this was the only funny thing there....the next time i will prefer much better hostels and the only advantage was the location...

<Content>relaxed The hortus was our first stop on our long journey. Although the rooms were very small, we did only have two per room, and for saftey reasons this was a bonus. Also because each room has its own safe it was very comforting to know your valuables were ok. The party atmosphere wasnt huge but the hortus was very relaxed and many joints were shared in the common room. The staff were friendly and helpful and so far it is the only hostel we've been to, to cook eggs every morning!!!! I would definately stay there again. Next time I wouldjust choose a busier time of year!

<Content>nasty room but good vibe Ok...a very good vibe but this place has nasty rooms...to get to your room you may have to climb 3 dangerously steep staircases...a tricky move if your carry your whole life on your back as I did traveling through europe...then they couldn't be bothered to put a hook in the shower closet so you actually have to try to hold your clothing while showing...the sound of the dutch toilets flushing can be heard at all hours of the night...plus this place is actually very far from the city center...many hostels are much much closer but there is a charming park and canal right there so the walk to the hortus is worth it...also you have to pay in cash...and it isn't that cheap....also some people get personal showers and toilets in their room and don't pay a penny more for them...so ask ahead if you can...so overall...not too bad..but not that good
