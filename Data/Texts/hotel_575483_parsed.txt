<Content>Very nice hotel Stayed a week in the Bellevue Hotel during mid-December. Arrived early--around 9:00 from Schiphol airport and at check-in the staff were kind enough to upgrade my room and offer me the room right away. Having read the advice on this website, I requested a room in the back, which was very quiet. I did hear other guests opening and closing doors in the hallway, but no outside noise. The room was comfortable and clean. Housekeeping did a good job. Breakfast which was included (they charge 10 euros otherwise) was American-style, with eggs, bacon, bread, cereal and so forth. I found the location--across the street from Centraal Station--to be very convenient.

<Content>Good value hotel I stayed 24 and 25 december 2008 and found the hotel well-situated, clean, friendly and a very good value at 65鈧?/night for a single. The hotel was not too full, so I think I got a double room, and I would agree it would be a little tight for two people with a lot of baggage. Agree with the comment that there is some noise in the hallway in the morning, but it did not start until after 9am, so really not a problem. I was very satisfied with the hotel.

<Content>Adequate in Amsterdam This hotel is a 5 minute walk from Central Station and conveniently located to dozens of restaurants, shops, souvenir shops, and sites. It's a 15 minute walk from Dam Square. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was small but very clean and the noise level in the hallway was at a minimum. The continental breakfast included breads, juice, coffee  tea, fruit, deli style meats, bacon, scrambled eggs, baked beans, and Poffertjes (mini Dutch pancakes). I would definately stay here again!

<Content>Staff were Excellent Read the reviews in Trip Advisor and selected to stay at this Hotel and we were not disappointed. Four of us stayed in two rooms on the fourth floor at the back so your views are limited. Room space is adequate but having stayed at larger hotels in Amsterdam you do not get much for your money in this city when it comes too room space. Breakfast is very good and does not finish till 10am weekdays and 11am at weekends and includes both hot and cold food. Easy to find almost directly opposite the central station and a excellent location to see all the sightsAll the Hotel Staff we found to be helpful especially Michiel Saaijer , and you can get information from the hotel at info@bellevuehotel.nl.For a good Freebie join the Amsterdam walking tour which leaves Dam Square at 11.15 am and 1.15pm every day. A three hour tour given by students which is both informative and funny. info at www.neweuropetours.eu.If you need a snack during the day go to La Place which is inside a large shop called V  D. The choice is amazing and is a well kept secret used by mostly Amsterdammer.If you enjoy Indian Currys we had a corker at Vijaya indian Restaurant, 23 Gelderse kade. Enjoy

<Content>Simple, clean hotel in excellent location The Bellevue Hotel is a small and simple hotel located 2 minutes walk from Amsterdam Centraal train station and the Damrak, possibly the city's busiest street.We booked a double room and were given room 314 on the 3rd floor. It was a very compact wee room but very clean and the furnishings looked quite new. The bathroom/shower room was small but functional and included one of those 'open' showers theyre so fond of on the continent - no actual shower fitting, just a curtain in the corner of the bathroom. But like I said it filled it's purpose very well and the water was always hotThe room also included a small working safe and a wall-mounted flatscreen tv which showed around 20 channels, of which around 6 or 7 were in English including major news channels. We didn'y have breakfast at the hotel as it was 10Euro and there are several places on Damrak offering breakfast and drinks for around 6 Euro, but the dining room was always busy so they must lay on a decent spread.The hotels location could not be better. Right at the heart of Amsterdam it is 2 minutes walk from the main train station (which itself is only 20 minutes from Schipol Airport) and 5 minutes from Dam Square where performers and artists were still hard at it even in cold November. The hotel was again only 5 minutes from the red light district and coffee shops, but this whole area is kind of hidden away and if you don't want to be bothered by it you can avoid it easily.All-in-all for the price and location the hotel cannot be beat, and I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the rooms. OK they are small and the halls look like a hostel but I'd definitely reccomend the Bellevue to most.

<Content>Great Location and value for money The hotel is really only a few minutes away from Central Station. I only arrived there at 11PM, but it was no hassle finding the hotel from Central Station. I was booked into a single room, which was quite small but that was no problem. It seems though that the single rooms are located at the back of the hotel and you have no view at all. It's no problem at all though as most of the time you spend exploring the city and then you don't care about the view. The hotel and room itself was very clean and the staff is just fantastic.The Hotel also offers free WiFi, which I didn't expect for the price that I paid. If you compare this to other small budget hotels in the area, this hotel is a gem. It's no wonder that I needed to book this hotel quite a while in advance as this is value for money. The location can't be any better and the whole of Amsterdam can be visited on foot from here. It's really just a hop away from everything Amsterdam has to offer.

<Content>Nice Place We stayed for 3 nights at the Bellevue Hotel in September/October - 28-01, 2008.The hotel room is is very clean and tiny, but it haven't bothered us at all. The room has a full-lenght mirror, wich I think is very useful, and the bed is very confy.The staff is very friendly and helpful, the restaurant surprised us, it has really nice food. The room we stayed in, wasn't noisy, so we could relax and sleep well after walking all day long through Amsterdam, which is a lovely city. The hotel has a great location as well, it's central and few minutes walk from the train station.Bellevue hotel is a great value for money. I recommend it.

<Content>Perfect for tourists Stayed here for three nights whilst holidaying in Amsterdam. The property is pretty close to the train station - Amsterdam Centraal (5 minute walk).Whilst the room was tiny, it was quite well presented. The lighting in the room was swank. The hotel is located on a street parallel to the Damrak and served as a perfect base to explore this wonderful city.

<Content>Diamond for Price and Location Hotel is located within an easy 5 minute walk from the Central Train Station, and all major tour groups leave from Damrack Blvd a mere 8 minute walk away. Trams or canal taxis are easy to catch from either in front of the hotel or Central Train Station when visiting city outskirts and museums. Hotel staff was extremely professional, and any extra need we had was attended too promptly and fully. We arrived at 7am and was told our room would be ready in a short 2 hours, which gave us time to have breakfast. At the end of our trip, departure was at 5am and the night clerk quickly prepared coffee for us from the restaurant that is attached to the hotel (same where hot breakfasts are offered; but the convenience and the price also allowed for nice lunches and dinners). Rooms may be simple in appearance, but extremely functional, clean and maintained well on a daily basis. Hotel has excellent security and an elevator was nice since so many reviews about other properties in Amsterdam spoke of only stairs being available. A walk to the Dam and Red Light area is a mere 10 minutes, 15 minutes to the Flower Market, and 20 minutes to Leidseplein or Rembrandtplein with plenty of window shopping along the way.

<Content>Pros  Just back after spending 4 nights at the Bellevue - booked (as ususal) on the back of Tripadvisor reviews.PROs: Great location - 3 minutes from Central Station. Clean - room was spotless. Very pleasant staff at reception. Comfortable bed.Generally speaking, what more could you ask for? BUT.....CONs: NO coffeee/tea facilities. NO mini-bar/fridge. NO ironing facilities. NO ice machines on premises.ALSO: one inch gap along bottom of room door meant both noise from other guests and light from hall came into room - ended up wedging coats into the gap in an attempt to keep out both. Rooms at front can be alittle noisy as hotel is situated at a busy junction.The room was a little cramped and definitely strangely laid out but it is Amsterdam after all. Overall I'd have to say that I have stayed in worse but at around 拢110 per night for a standard double I would have expected a little more - even real glasses in the bathroom would have been nice rather than the cheap disposable ones which went unchanged by room service for the entire length of our stay.SL N.

<Content>Great Location, Wonderful City I was dreading the small room problem that I read about on this web site. It turned out to not be much of an issue. We were at the end of a 2 week trip that included 10 days on a cruise in the Baltic Sea. This means a lot of luggage to lug around. We had 3 45-50 Lb bags. They all fit in the room, the 2 chairs have to face each other, with one bag resting on the 2 seats. We had a room facing the street (highly recommended). The bathroom had a good size window sill to leave your bathrooom accessories on. The flat screen TV and the beds were very acceptable.We did not have breakfast included, so went to the corner restaurant every morning (turn right as you leave the hotel). The prices were reasonable and the quality of the food and service was 1st rate. We tried the hotel restaurant when we initially checked in. It was very expensive, and the waitress left a lot to be desired. She did not ask if we were staying at the hotel. This caused me to use a credit card for the full price. When I signed the receipt I found out we were entitled to a 10% discount and could have added it to the bill at check-out. She would not reverse the charge and could not understand why this was a problem. I complained to the front desk, but I don't think management was that concerned. Of course I would not consider eating at their restaurant for the remainder of the 4 day stay. The rest of the staff were good, with the front desk being really outstanding.The train from the airport to the Central Station is about 20 minutes and cost 8 Euros for 2 people. When you come out of the station, go right, past all the bicycles and walk across the street to the hotel. I did not find out about the Amsterdam discount book for museums, restaurants and trams until the last day of the trip. I believe it is called, I love Amsterdam. It looks like you can save a considerable amount of money by getting it. The front desk must know where to buy them.Amsterdam is a terrific city with wonderful sites, great night life and very friendly people. Not speaking Dutch is not a problem, as they teach English in the schools from the fourth grade through High School. Enjoy the City!!!

<Content>Alright hotel This was alright hotel considering the price. From a location point of view it was good and we found we were never far away from any of the locations we had to go to in the city.The room we were in was clean but small. It faced onto an internal light shaft so we had no view, meaning you basically kept the blind down. We also found that the beds dipped in at the middle which was a little uncomfortable but the room itself was quite, which was a plus. For the price it was adequate.

<Content>Ideally located The Bellevue is ideally located for folks taking the train into Amsterdam. It is a half block from the train station. All rooms are immaculately clean, modern, have central air conditioning, and small but comfortable beds. There is an elevator for the disabled and/or those with lots of luggage. The rooms are not huge but have a very reasonable amount of space. I don't recommend trying to cram a third friend into a room intended for 2, because there won't be enough space to fit comfortably. The hotel is centrally located, but the street itself is far enough from the bars and coffeeshops for noise to not be an issue. The staff is very very helpful and friendly. There is a laundromat 3 blocks away where you can do your own wash for 5 euros or have them do it for 8.50 euros. It's not cheap to stay here but you do get good value for your money.

<Content>Good location Having stayed in a bit of a dump last time we went to Amsterdam, I was hoping that this place would be a little better and was pleasantly surprised.The rooms are small, which is normal for Amsterdam but fine for a weekend stay. The place is clean and friendly and the breakfast was good.Its right by the station which we found very handy as we stored our bags there on the last day. It also meant that we were walking distance to everything which made getting about so easy.Its on a main road so its not quiet but it wasnt enough noise to disturb us too much.We got a good price on the room which made it really good value for the money and I would re book if we came back providing the room rate was as good.

<Content>Bellevue is believably the best budget bargain As an airline employee, I have had the pleasure of visiting Amsterdam dozens of times with the opportunity to experience new hotel properties on each trip. My most recent stay in July, 2008 brought me to the Bellevue after reading the many positive reviews at Tripadvisor. My only disappointment was that I did not stay here previously! In brief detail, here are the top reasons why you might want to stay here too:1) Location: Walk out of Centraal Station, cross the street and turn right and you're home at your hotel. Early morning flights from Schipol are no problem anymore and you won't tire from lugging your luggage across town to the train.2) Ambiance: The post-modern minimalist decor is fantastic. Ambient light comes from everywhere in the room and the white color scheme makes the rooms feel much larger than they actually are. As one reviewer noted, the showers are wonderful with great water pressure and hot water that never runs out.3) Free WiFi: Excellent speeds and strong signal; enough said.4) Security: No room key - no lift access.5) Comfort: Soft, comfy beds and AIRCON make for a good night's sleep.6) Service: Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. I had to have some travel documents from the UK sent far in advance of my arrival and they were waiting for me upon check-in with no hassle.7) Price point: Amsterdam is expensive, period. In my opinion, the room rates are very reasonable comparable with other hotels that do not offer the above six reasons to stay here.Negatives:1) It's a non-smoking property. If you like to have your coffeeshop smokes in your room you'll have to go outside to take a puff.2) Location: If you do not need easy train access and/or don't have a lot of luggage to haul around, then there are far better places to stay outside the tourist trap of the Damrak area. Even better, get out of Amsterdam and stay in Haarlem or Zandvoort and take the train in to town for your shopping and nightlife.Hope that helps with your travel plans; have a great time in Europe's top city!

<Content>Great location, tiny rooms Location is great if you want to be close to the train station and the action in that general area, which we did. Our room faced the street and it was surprisingly quiet with the windows closed (the air conditioning worked very well). If you're hoping to be in a more peaceful area (near Vondelpark, the museums, the quieter canals), choose another hotel. For us, the location was just right.The rooms are tiny and the furniture is awkwardly arranged. Practicality is sacrificed for high style. Is it too much to ask for the bathroom to have one surface big enough to place a toothbrush? For any task that requires you to use more than one item at a time (shaving, putting on makeup) you need to be a juggler -- there is absolutely nowhere to put anything, not even on the side of the sink. You'll need to keep your toiletries somewhere near the bed and constantly carry everything you need in and out of the bathroom. Foolish design choices! We had a superior twin and for two people it was very crowded, even allowing for generally small hotel rooms in Europe. Room was clean, but the carpet is geting dirty. The plastic cups in my room had been used (and washed, I believe) and were cracked. Mattresses are thin.Breakfast is good (it was included in our room rate). I would stay here again if I found a great deal online, despite the oddities of the rooms, mainly because the location is so good. Nice staff in the lobby and in the restaurant.

<Content>A bit disappointed Having read the good reviews, we were looking forward to our stay. The best thing about the Bellevue is it's location, 5 minutes from Central Station. The rooms are clean  light, and the staff were helpful. However, the standard of the room is about the same as a Travel Inn or Travelodge, but at 拢115 without breakfast, not cheap. We booked a Queen bedroom, but the bed was a standard double. When we queried it, we were told those were the biggest beds they had. The room itself was pretty small, with very limited storage space, particularly in the bathroom. No tea/coffee making facilities.

<Content>Okay, but expensive for what it was The Bellevue is well positioned near to the main train station, however at nearly 拢100 per night without breakfast, it was not good value at all. The first night, we were put in a smoking room at the bottom of an internal well and it was dark, noisy and small. They did move us the next day to a lighter, non-smoking room, but it was small still. The staff were very polite and the room was clean, but I feel that it was a lot of money for such a small, and mediocre room.

I enjoyed the access to the outside (Building is three sided with a rooftop walk way on the fourth side to get around to the eleveator) - did miss a coffee maker, none provided. The staff was absolutely delightful and never tired of questions and gave perfect guidance and assistance on every topic. Was only in AMS for one night, and would stay here again!

<Content>Buyer Beware! My wife and I travel quite alot and always use trip advisor as our guide to finding a great hotel as other visitors views are a fantastic tool to prepare a good trip and everytime this has been the case. This particular hotel rate's highly amongst fellow 'trip advisors' reviews, so we booked this hotel and confirmed all the details through our agent. On arrival at the hotel we were advised our booking was cancelled, however upon calling our agent 'Ebookers' we were advised the booking was NOT cancelled. Therefore the hotel offered us the sister hotel 'Avenue Hotel' which is supposed to be of 'equal standard', believe me it isn't ( full review posted on the Avenue Hotel) . We believe this hotel the 'Belle Vue' realise it's popularity and double book rooms so to fill up it's sub-standard sister hotel. Buyer beware, you may not be buying a room this hotel when you book.

<Content>Great Location, Clean, but look for a deal. My partner and I stayed at the Bellevue for 2 nights. The room was clean and ready at our arrival.The location can't be beaten for the price (if u manage to get a good deal - which we did) - right opposite the canal boat launch as soon as you exit Centraal Station.The only down sides (if you could even go so far as to say that) is that we had no top sheets: just a doona (duvet) and bottom sheet; the rooms are very modern, which also means very minimalistic: no array of toiletries, no coffee maker, no fridge or mini bar....but if you are visiting Amsterdam, you shouldn't be hanging out in your room all day. Also, there is no internet facility in the hotel, though they do have wi-fi, and there is an internet cafe within 50m of the front door.The rooms can be a bit noisy as you can here doors closing from the other side of the hotel on your floor, but the outside noise/street was minimal from our rear room.The only other thing is the common trend to have a shower with no recess,(at least in the hotels I have stayed at in Amsterdam) which leads to water flowing onto the bathroom floor in some/a lot of cases, though ours was quite minimal.If it is your first visit to Europe, don't be alarmed at the size of your room: they are ALL small. Experience the country and culture and all it has to offer, not your room.All in all The Bellevue is above par for a moderately priced hotel in Amsterdam, and i would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Convenient, good value for money This is a nice, little hotel, just across the street from Amsterdam CS (Central station) where you arrive for instance from Schiphol airport.Behind it's medieval facade, Bellevue is a quite modernly designed hotel, though, with it's Dutch design taken a little too far. When you step into the room, you feel like being already in the bathroom, everything in white and glass. When you get into the bathroom you feel like being in the lavatory of the plane you flew in on; everything is modernistic, practical, simplistic. When this hotel is worn down one day, it is going feel real basic. But the place and price was right.

The hotel is very centrally located , just mins across from Central Station and within walking distance from Dam Square . Get the train from Schipol Airport , its on ly about 鈧?.60!!

<Content>Great location Ideal location for exploring Amsterdam. Right opposite Centraal station, very near to tram/bus terminus, canal boat cruise start point, and bicycle hire depot MacBike. There is a good choice of restaurants and cafes within walking distance.The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the place was spotlessly clean, and the snack and drink prices reasonable.The rooms were small, but just about adequate. Very comfortable beds, free safe deposit box in each room, plenty of hot water.Our room overlooked the main street, but most traffic noise stopped by double glazed window, and it gave an interesting street view. However, lots of rooms at the hotel have a window onto an inner void, so check what you are getting.

<Content>Comfortable Place to Rest A Weary Head... Two of us booked double rooms here for a night to see a concert, so the hotel was chosen as literally a bed for the night. Rooms were tiny, even by Amsterdam standards, but immaculate in gleaming white and quiet as they overlooked a central lightwell. Pod-style shower/toilet, and just enough room for a comfortable standard double, minute glazed wardrobe and flat-screen TV. Good location on a main street opposite Central Station, friendly  helpful staff, and a bustling bar/brasserie on the ground floor.Great for seeing the sights and keenly priced, but you wouldn鈥檛 want to spend much time in your room.

<Content>Great location, wonderfull trip!! We stayed at the Bellevue back in October and thought it was lovely. Small and compact rooms that are decorated in a modern style and a plasma TV. Comfy beds and clean bathroom and bedroom. Brekfast was nice, plenty of choice and tasty too. We found this hotel to be in an idel location for exploring the city in which we walked everywhere and managed to see a lot in 3 days. Amsterdam was very cold in October, and Ive been in the summer too and its not that warm then either so a coat is advisable. When you arrivel at Schipol get the train which takes you direct to centraal station, you can buy your train tickets at kiosks at the airport, its only a few euros. When you arrive at the station go right and the road the hotel is on is basically straight infront and the hotel is on the left as you're walking from the station. Check in/out were fine, and they let us store our luggage for free in a room once we'd checked out as we had a flight later in the day. There's plenty of places to eat near the hotel, we liked the soup bar about 2 buildings down from the hotel, it was reasonably priced and was delicious too. I would definitley stay at this hotel again because of the great location.

<Content>The Bellevue My boyfriend and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at Bellevue hotel and we had a very pleasant time. We arrived during a snow shower which gave our visit a little bit of magic but unfortunately it turned into showers of rain the next day. The hotel was very clean and well ran, the room was small but very comfortable we had a wet room for a bathroom which was different the shower was really powerful! The staff were friendly. The location of the hotel is fab only 5 mins on foot from central station and only 10 mins away from the red light district etc. Everything was in walking distance including good places to eat and many good coffee shops (home grown fantasy was just down the road!). This was our 2nd stay in Amsterdam previously stayed at Avenue Hotel which belongs to the same chain as Bellevue would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Bellevue: Great location and service! The Bellevue Hotel in central Amsterdam was a great little hotel that I stayed at on a business trip. Since it is extremely close to the Centraal Station, I was able to hop on a train to Utrecht for business, but then see the sights and enjoy Amsterdam's city centre without a problem. The rooms were not very big, but that is the way in the Netherlands, so I was not expecting much on that front. The room's bathroom was clean, no frills, but functional. I was happy that they had a TV in the room with more than one channel in English.All in all, the service was quite good and friendly. My boyfriend fell ill for a couple of days and the kitchen was kind enough to make something that was not on the menu without a fuss, too. That type of service was nice to come by.

<Content>amazing shower!! Bellevue hotel was just perfect for our stay although we did end up with non smoking rooms despite requesting otherwise. it is very centrally located 5 mins from Dam Square, Central Station, Canal Tours etc and about 10 mins walk to red light district. Plenty of bars and cafes near by.Rooms were very nice for a budget hotel. nicely decorated with a safe but no tea/coffee facilities. Had the most amazing shower ever!! This was a very secure hotel and you need to be buzzed in then have a key to get up in the lift so felt very safe.Didnt have breakfast as were never up in time but plenty of pubs near by do all day full breakfasts.

<Content>Great location We have just returned from a three night stay at the Bellevue. We arrived at 10am and were given room 503, although check in is at 2pm which was great. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpfull. As stated in most reviews the rooms are small but modern,bright and very clean. We had a great view from our room and could see central station. Hotel could not be in a better location for sight seeing. Bellevue is also very safe as staff member has to let you in and you need key card to get into lift. We didnt eat in hotel but there are lots of cafes near by. Overall good value at 鈧?90 for two for 3 nights without breakfast.If i were to return to Amsterdam again i would stay at the bellevue.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel The Bellevue Hotel is a modern, clean, minimal, hotel located just in front the Amsterdam Central Station.It is perfect for business and leisure time.The room are extremely clean, the design is minimal and superb, you feel pampled.The rooms are not big, you have enough space but not too much.It is a 3 stars hotel but in fact I have been in several 4 stars that are really far away from the comfort of the Bellevue Hotel.The staff is very helpful, the breakfast is really good.The Hotel is worthy of each single cents you pay for it.A wonderful hotel in the heart of Amsterdam with a very reasonable price.In one word: excellent!

<Content>good clean hotel the bellevue is a good value hotel in a good location, less than a 5 minute walk from central station and 1 minute until you're on damrak. yes the rooms are small but they've got everything you need in them and how much time do you spend in your room when you're in amsterdam anyway? one thing i did notice about the room though was that the walls are paper thin. think we were in room 108 on the ground floor and you could literally hear the t.v. in the room opposite and people using the staircase next to the room. take earplugs if you're a light sleeper! the breakfast was fine but i wouldn't have been happy to have paid the prices some people say they did because fine describes it well. assortments of cereals and the usual continental stuff and pre cooked bacon, sausage etc. but if we weren't bb i'd have been disappointed. good clean hotel for 3 star and the staff are friendly and very helpful.

<Content>Great Spot Booked for 1 night after reading reviews on this website and we came away very impressed with the hotel.Is located just across from the Centraal train station, and turned out to be very easy to find (as you leave the station, look ahead and slightly to the right - you'll see the hotel's sign quite clearly). It's also just a short walk across to Dam Square and the redlight and coffeeshop districts, which is convenient and also nice not to be amongst it too much.Rooms were modern, although there was no real view to speak of - we had internal views of other guests' windows. Bathrooms are small, with a lack of space to put your toiletries etc, and there was no divide between the shower recess and the bathroom floor - which meant a wet bathroom floor (which really, isn't much of a problem unless it's your own bathroom, is it?). The LCD TVs were great, although you wouldn't want to spend all day in your hotel room as their was only BBC World and CNN on the box in English.Staff were friendly and great at English, and the people of Amsterdam in general are all very pleasant and outgoing. We paid 128 Euro for the night, which was a fairly reasonable deal for what we got.I'd definitely go back.

<Content>Heaven My partner and I have just arrived back from amsterdam feeling rejuvenated, and the Hotel Bellvue is partly to blame. we arrived in Schippol, not sure which way to get the train, but dutch people are so friendly and helpful. got the train on platform 3 and in less than 13mins we were at central station! asked at a nearby kiosk where the bellvue hotel was and it was litterally over the bridge, 5min walk. we were greeted by the receptionist and given our double smoking room(our choice). a bit surprised initially at the room size, but when you sleep in the bed(which is very little), we slept the best and comfortable bed we have ever slept in. the total white of the room all makes sense as it is totally chill out, which is what amsterdam is all about. the hotel is central to everything, great coffee shops, and bars, our favourite was Wonder Bar (try the pipe, so good!!!)which was just around the corner and Gringos restaurant is a must. amsterdam was a complete cultural shock as there was not a mobile phone to be seen or heard, people actually talked to each and enjoyed the company. i rented a bike for 2 hours for 6euros and what a way to see the place. I could not fault this hotels location and that the art of sleeping is perfected. Heaven!!!!!!!

<Content>Extremly good value! Pros:- Extremely good price for what you get- Room is large enough- Bathroom behind sliding door doesn't matter. Most importantly, it is a clean bathroom- Large shower- Comfy double bed. Not king size nor queen size, but who cares when the bed is normal and good to sleep in.- White rooms are pleasant- Close to the central station- Free movie channels- Free WLAN- Feel secure. Key to open the elevator, and entrance to hotel is locked unless guests need to get in- Quiet rooms (we were on top floor)- Free large safe- Care for the environment. You decide if they should wash your towels every nightCons:- Need to walk a bit to get to the nice shops and restaurants- They give you the key to the luggage room, instead of walking there with you- No refrigerator in room

<Content>Great location I booked this on reading reviews on this site and for the main,we were not disappointed.Its in a fantastic location as others have said.The reception staff were helpul and friendly.The room though was TINY.And I had paid extra for an upgrade.We were in single beds pushed together.I hated the fact that there was nowhere to put cosmetics in the bathroom and also there were no little hotel toiletries.The place was spotless,though the sheets were not changed for the 4 day duration of our stay.If you are just staying for a weekend,dont have a huge amount of luggage and not planning to spend too much time in your room,this is the place for you.

<Content>located with excellent room! We booked a premium room, at very little extra cost, and certainly liked it, in terms of decor, size and facilities. It was quiet enough, being double glazed, despite being on frontage. Air conditioning was useful, avoiding that too hot feeling of some hotel rooms.Good breakfast (bacon, eggs. sausages etc, plus usual cheese, meats , cereals options)Hotel staff friendly, English-speaking - allowed us use of luggage room for last hours.Definitely stay there again - recommended! (PS try 'oldest bar in Amsterdam' in same block - perfect brown cafe style)

<Content>Bellevue: grows on you The Bellevue hotel is very centrally located just accross from central train station, which means easy access to anywhere in the city via tram, which all terminate at the station. On the downside, it is located close to Damark, which to me is pretty cheap and nasty, with tacky restraunts, souviner shops and hotels.The hotel itself is spotlessly clean, warm and comfortable, with no noise in the rooms, despite being on a busy street. The staff are also very friendly. However the rooms are small. It is definetly worth paying the extra few euro for a superior room. The decor is unusual and whilst I appreciate modern design, architecture wasnt too sure about the white minimilist design at the start .. but it grows on you. All in all I would reccomend this place

<Content>Excellent hotel - great location Me and a friend booked rooms in this hotel for two nights in November, and found it to be a fantastic place to stay. It is located five minutes away from Centraal Station and is minutes away from all the main attractions, even when walking. The hotel is immaculately presented, both inside and out, and is very well run. The reception workers were very polite and helpful (something all the Dutch seemed to be). The layout of the rooms is very simple (as you can see from the previous photo's). There is air conditioning (most welcome if you go in summer), and a spacious and well presented toilet / shower area. There are chairs and an LCD TV, which had a decent variety of channels, both in English and Dutch. There is ample clothes storage, a room safe and a phone. There were no tea / coffee making facilities in the room, which I felt actually removed some of the tackiness associated with some hotel rooms.Our booking included breakfast, which consisted of cereals, meats / cheeses for sandwhiches and juices / tea / coffee etc. It was very nice and gave a good start to the day. The restaraunt area was very well presented and run efficiently by the staff.Overall, this hotel is fantastic, and I will stay here again when I return in a few months.

<Content>Best location and great breakfast We booked this hotel based on all the positive reviews we read. We are glad we did. The hotel is conveniently located right across from Central Station and within walking distance to all the main attractions. The room was modern and comfortable, the bathroom was a nice size (for Europe) and the flat screen TV was nice, too. The best part was the breakfast, it is one of the best ones we ever had in Europe, wide selection of cereals, cheeses, breads, hard boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, fruit...and much more). If you don't want to walk to the museums, you can take the tram # 2 or # 5 right outside Central Station.Overall, I think this is the best location in Amsterdam and good value. We will definitely recommend it and if we go back to Amsterdam, we will stay in the Bellevue Hotel again.

<Content>Convenient Location! This hotel's location is very convenient for most of the tourist attractions, and is also within walking distance of the train station. The rooms are small, but we were told to expect this in Amsterdam. Room and bathroom were both very clean. We had no shower curtain which meant that the bathroom got soaked every time we tried to shower. Do not spend ten euro on the breakfast. Definately not worth it!!

<Content>Convenient Stop Over We used this hotel as a one night stop over to spend a day sight seeing in Amsterdam. We walked to the hotel from the station in five minutes and were able to leave our luggage while we went into the city. The reception staff were excellent. The rooms are very small but, as we were on a stop over and spent very little time there it was not an issue. For a longer stay the lack of wardrobe space could have been a problem.Be warned however, the opening times of the bistro are very rigid and several people, us included, were told off by the waiter for coming down to breakfast at the last minute.

<Content>White room My first impression of this hotel was very sterile, white and feels like I am staying in the basement of a science lab. There were air vents above the door and majority of the time the room just felt stuffy. I am not claustrophobic, but the small room combined with white walls and lights made me feel uneasy. It didn't have a cosy feel to what I was use to either. However, the rooms were clean and the location was perfect. I just don't think it is suited to me personally and will not come back here again.
