<Content>Will definitely stay here again Great hotel. The rooms are large (by Asian standards) and clean. The rooms look better than the official photos. The rooms are well designed with a lot of convenient little details. However, Japan don't seem to believe in disposable slippers. They have reusable sanitized slippers.Staff is polite and helpful. And their English is good, better than the hotel I stayed at in Ikebukuro.Good location. The subway is less than 5 min on foot and has two key lines that will take you to Ginza and Shinjuku. People were friendly, helpful and polite.

<Content>Excellent stay Well, this hotel was recommended to me by my business associate in Tokyo. I stayed at this hotel from 14 Dec- 19 Dec. I found that the overall efficiency of operations at the hotel was excellent. The staff were very efficient, extremely courteous and were able to communiate very well in English. The hotel had a terrific choice of restaurants providing a variety of cuisine. Overall ambience at the hotel was very good. All this at a reasonable tariff as compared to the existing rates at Tokyo.V VenugopalMuscat

<Content>Great stay - way too short. Enjoyed a wonderful one night stay at the Grand Prince Akasaka, all for under US$165 courtesy of a friend's corporate room rate.This is a centrally located 40 story hotel (15 minute walk to Imperial Gardens, 5 minute walk to closest subway platform) that seems to have been built in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Views from our room were excellent. The room was very clean and bright. Based on the designs, it appears that neither the room nor the lobby have been renovated since the hotel's opening, however everything has been fantastically maintained and things were obviously done right the first time 'round. The in-room lights have a cool 'retro' design. Two important things have been updated: the in-room TV (19 inch flat-screen) and the 'intelligent' toilet seat.We visited the Sky-Lounge on the top floor of the hotel. It was mid-night on a Tuesday night and it was pretty much empty. The views were fantastic. We were served by an attentive and stylish waiter who made one of the better whiskey-sours I've ever tasted.I would recommend this hotel if you can find a room for under US$200, which in the current environment, shouldn't be a problem.

<Content>Better places to stay in Roppongi Having lived in this area of Tokyo for a period of time, the Grand Prince immediately came to mind as a potential place to stay on a return trip to the city. It comes across well on Trip Advisor, had great rates and is ranked as a 5* hotel so appeared to be a slam dunk hotel choice. Unfortunately I left feeling let down and extremely disappointed.The room was basic, the interior dated and the facilities were more 2* than 5*. The hotel is a maze to navigate and the staff are very polite but not particularly helpful. There is only so much that incessant bowing and smiling can do when you have problems. Room service didn't exist, neither did in room movies, an ironing board or any other facilities that you would expect from a lesser ranked establishment. Even trying to obtain fresh towels was a mission (and one that we never accomplished). One would have expected a gym or pool or a top class restaurant - but alas these were all noticeably lacking. The large airy lobby would seem impressive to the untrained eye, but pretty much summed up the hotel - a waste of space.Oh and if you happen to leave in a taxi make sure you take a card. Even the local taxi drivers seem to have forgotten it. And if you still forget - just pronounce it grand-oo purince-oo and you've got a vague hope of getting home (although you may just wish to kip at Tokyo eki as the facilities are probably more 5* there)

<Content>Excellent value and service I spent four nights here in September and October, each night in a different room (nothing to do with the hotel, just due to my own plans).We picked up a very good price on the internet and were extremely happy with our choice. I spent more money one night as a business hotel in a small town which was just big enough for the two twin beds and a bathroom that literally would have been impossible to fit two people standing in side by side.Being a drop off/pick up point for the Limousine Airport bus is also a good plus. It was only a 2 minute walk to the subway which was extemely handy and gave access to several different lines.As others have mentioned the lobby is a bit sterile but as all I ever do is walk through it, I don't see this as a problem. Each of the rooms were a good size, particularly by Japanese standards. The beds in the twin bedded rooms were standard size and the two nights when I had a double room they were king size beds. All of the rooms had a good view. In one of the four rooms the lounge was slightly stained. No, you wouldn't call the room luxurious, but that were of a good standard.We found the service to be excellent. Despite the fact that we had throughly bamboozled the staff by who was coming and going and the person staying in the room wasn't necessarily the person who booked the room (long story) they coped and did not give us a hard time about it at all. The concierge was also extremely helpful.

<Content>Good value for money After reading the reviews of this hotel on tripadvisor and we felt it was right choice for us. We wanted was a sizeable room with a comfortable bed at a convenient location and we weren't dissappointed. The decor of the lobby was dated but it doesn't bother us. The room were spacious and comfortably fit 3 of us - 2 adults and a baby. The staff were extremely polite and helpful whevenever we asked for directions or food recommendations. The airport limo bus dropped us off and picked us up at the hotel which was very convenient. Many good restaurants within 10 mins walk of the hotel (across the flyover). For the price we paid through expedia ($110 per night), we couldn't be more pleased.

<Content>This is a two star. Max. Don't stay at the Grand Prince Akasaka. If you read no more of this review I have hopefully done my duty in protecting you from this hotel.The positives: the location is fine, close to the subways and 10-15mins walk from Roppongi. The staff are polite (this IS Japan...) (but see below re not being helpful at all). The negatives: there was a banner in the lobby proclaiming The Grand Prince's 25 birthday. This was the last time it was decorated. The rooms are clean but UTTERLY functional without any frills. The furniture is 70s Bond Movie formica. The beds are small and ok but not 5* by any stretch of the imagination with cheap white sheets and a wafer of a pillow. There is no room service (surely this is a pre-requisite for a 5* hotel?!) and not even anywhere to get breakfast first thing in the morning - a pain when you have a morning flight.AND...no movies. This wouldn't normally be the crux of my opinion of a hotel but on a rainy Sunday when all we wanted to do was watch a movie we were a bit flummoxed when none would load. So we phoned reception. The (very polite) receptionist informed us that none were loaded (despite the room info stating that they had movie choices). We asked why. The hotel hadn't bought any. Ok, so what did they suggest? The receptionist informed us that they had adult movies. Hmm. Funnily enough my platonic friend and I didn't want to watch porn on a Sunday afternoon so what else could they do for us? Eg could they get us some DVDs? Or offer us a partial refund? To cut a long story short we had 7 phone calls with various members of staff who promised to check what they could do and then simply phoned back to tell us they had no movies (yes, we knew that much). But they couldn't do anything more for us except (and they were very excited about this)...free minibar. Since the minibar was stocked with one small bottle of vinegar/wine and one tiny beer this wasn't so exciting for us.Politeness only gets you so far if it is not mixed with helpfulness.Eventually we got a few yen knocked off our bill when we checked out which was a complete shock to us since they had been adamant we would get nothing.The Grand Prince must have rated itself a 5* because in no realm of any universe could any rating agency have thought that it was worthy of anything more than 1.5/2.

<Content>Great Architecture!!! My family and I which included my wife and two teenagers really enjoyed our stay at the Akasaka Prince.It has been 23 years since I stayed there last and it still remains very modern and up to date. The views from the upper floors are magnificent, and the location is great. Service from the staff was excellant except for the concierge one night who seemed a little aloof when asking about local resturants in the area. The rooms and bathrooms are very comfortable with a great seating area which runs along the windows. The only major complaint I had was that you had to pay $15 a night for internet. It should be included in the room rate for the price and level of this hotel. It also would have been nice to have an athletic facility. Kenzo Tang did a great job of designing this establishment with an edgy contemporary look and a place that has great views from every room. The local area around the hotel was also fun at night exploring the local places to eat. It is a convienent location with the subway next door and the airport limo bus drops you off and picks you up at the front door. I would certainly stay there again when vistiting this interesting and vibrant city.

<Content>A great place in Tokyo I stayed here as part of a cultural exchange program and the Government of Japan paid for the stay (so I cannot speak to its value for the dollar). What I can attest to, however, is the quality of service and amenities the hotel offers. All were second to none, and no detail was overlooked. The staff was courteous and attentive, the rooms were spacious (by Japanese standards) and clean, and the location was unbeatable (two different metro stops are right outside the hotel: Akasaka-Mitsuke and Nagatacho). The small district of Akasaka is just a block from the hotel and is a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the more popular districts, but still has enough restaurants and shopping to satisfy. I highly recommend the Akasaka Prince.

<Content>Convenient hotel, good value in Tokyo. Even though experience rates as modest overall, this is still a very good bet while in Tokyo. Interior is very dated, there are no exercise facilities, etc., but this seems to be true in all but the best hotels in Japan. The rooms are quite large, but do not bother paying for the business suite! It's exactly the same as the large guest rooms - only the shampoo is nicer and you get a massage chair (i.e. not worth it).The location is unbeatable. It's only a 20-minute taxi ride from the airport monorail to Haneda and they also provide very reasonably priced shuttle services to both airports. A stone's throw from the Imperial Palace (a great place to run!) and at the center of the metro so you can get anywhere very quickly. Service is wonderful and they even give you 1000 yen (about 10 bucks) to use in their bars and shopping areas per day that you opt out of cleaning. Restaurants are decent and there is a fair through the end of June that makes the prices almost reasonable.

<Content>Decor dated, interior cold feeling, but service impeccable This hotel has been around for several decades and the interior shows it. The lobby has a cold, marble feel to it (not a welcoming atmosphere), and the room we got felt painfully dated.However, this was made up for a multitude of times by the impeccable service (perhaps the standards in Japan are just plain high?) and attention. By North American standards, the place is overstaffed with friendly and attentive people. We were a family of four and I had booked a room with two double beds, but we were upgraded to a suite. The space had two bathrooms and a great view. Separate living space with a second TV, etc. Well above what we were expecting for the rate we got (from a website) of about USD200.Also, the location could not be beat as it was close to the subway, many shops that we did not have the time to vist, and only a few stops from Tokyo station. It was close also to the Ninja Restaurant that I had read about on this site. All in all, it made for a great stay for us.

<Content>Absolutely superb Even by the high standards of luxury hotels in Japan, the Grand Prince Akasaka is outstanding. Many well-trained, friendly and helpful staff, large and comfortable bedrooms, excellent food - and if you shop around you can find very good room rates: I paid 13,000 yen ++, for a single room. The large buffet breakfast is worth it (2,700 yen), not least for the superlative view from the 40th floor; and you can sit and drink coffee for as long as you wish.

<Content>Excellent hotel and terrific value for money We stayed 2 days first, then away for 2 days, and back for another five. First 2 days we were upgraded to a suite with a fantastic living room and 2 bathrooms. Next 5 days were in a large sized double with great view from 30th floor. All this for about 拢75 a night! Location is good and 2 mins walk from subway entrance. The staff make it seem like a much smaller family run hotel, they are so helpful and polite. Styling is a bit 'retro' but we quite liked the quirkiness, and preferred this to the usual sterile hotel room environment. Finally, we left our passports and money in the safe. After calling them they were incredibly helpful and forwarded our things very promptly by special delivery to our next hotel. This is expensive to do in Japan, and they did it free of charge because we stayed 7 days. I think that sums up the attitude at this excellent hotel. We will be staying again!!

<Content>Very nice hotel and AMAZING bargain. This is a very nice hotel in a very good neighborhood. We paid $140 for some nights, and could have gotten a lower price if we'd paid in advance. I'll say it flat out: that's one of the best hotel bargains I've ever seen.The staff is spectacular -- very helpful and polite. 24-hour internet access in the lobby, but only one computer. It was busy less than half the time. Small irritation. There's a good, dirt-cheap bakery around the corner, and a subway stop for the Ginza line is a three-minute walk.The room was a good size, and since every room in the hotel is above the 20th floor the views are amazing.The decor is definitely dated from the 70s, but it's not like it was dirty or anything. And some rooms have lousy air conditioning. I called the front desk and they got it fixed -- somehow without actually visiting the room. The second room we got, on a later stay, had a better system that worked right away.The Akasaka area is fun even if you're only slightly adventurous, turning borderline red-light late at night. (Every time we walked nearby streets someone would ask if we'd be interested in going to a bar with topless women.) On the plus side, it was always lively, and easy to find snacks and beer to bring back to the hotel.By the way, this hotel is also called the Akasaka Prince on some websites, and some cabdrivers only know that name.

<Content>Great room, service  We stayed here for 2 nights in Sept 07 and were most impressed by everything this hotel has to offer. The hotel is close to many Japanese  Western restaurants and the rail station. The service was brilliant even by Japanese standards - nothing was too much trouble and the Concierge and Porter were most helpful.The highlight was the room. After 5 weeks of European rooms this was palacial in size and facilities. We obtained a good rate through Priceline but beware the service charge and consumption tax that add 10%  5.5% to your on-line quoted room rate.We would certainly stay there again and recommned it to others.PS - if you're new to Tokyo as we were, English language ATMs can initially be quite hard to find but are often in the small 7/11 style supermarkets and Post Offices.

<Content>Great Location, Large rooms We stayed here for 6 nights in February, and it was our base for sightseeing around Tokyo. The hotel is very impressive, and the main plus is the size of the rooms - very big by Tokyo standards, with a large double aspect window overlooking Mount Fuji, a dining table and seating area, loads of storage space and a large bathroom with bath. The hotel is across the road from the Subway entrance and a short walk from many restaurants, both Japanese and English, such as Mc Donalds, Subway, and a few others. It is a nice area to stay and felt safe to walk around at night. We found this hotel great value for money when booked through Opodo, however the hotel's direct rates were far far more expensive so shop around! The Hotel has several restaurants and bars including a cocktail bar on the top floor, well worth a look just for the view which is stunning. Overall I would recommend this hotel for travellers, although I can't comment on the business facilities.

The service at this hotel couldn't be more attentive. The concierge helped with restaurant recommendations and reservations. The view from the room was good, we were on the 34th floor. The restaurants in the hotel were pricey, but there are plenty of other options nearby. There is an excellent bakery just outside the 3rd floor entrance that we used for an inexpensive breakfast in our room.

<Content>All Around Pretty Good The hotel is very clean, the staff very friendly. Tips are added automatically into your bill, so don't worry about tipping. The location maybe isn't the absolute best in Tokyo, but it's pretty good. It is a short 5 minute walk to the Akasaka metro stop, and the ride to Ginza, Roppongi, etc. is very quick. The area is very clean and safe at night, more so than other parts of town (Sujuku). The hotel is more modern than some of the similarly priced hotels in Tokyo (i.e. New Otani). This is a great choice for business travelers, perhaps not as great for romantic couples who are looking for something a little more quaint or secluded.

<Content>Good value for Tokyo! I have been to Tokyo many times and I know that on the whole hotels there are quite expensive, similar to hotels in NYC, London and HK. Luckily, we found a really good deal online for the Akasaka Prince hotel, so we decided to give it a go. I have stayed in many hotels in Shinjuku before, so it was nice to stay in a different and less touristy area for a change. This hotel is huge but surprisingly it doesn't feel like a touristy hotel. We took the 'limousine bus' from the airport because it stopped right in front of the hotel, so it was more convenient than taking the train even though it probably took longer. The service at reception area was efficient and professional but not particularly warm. The room itself was really big and the view was amazing since we paid a bit extra to be on the top floors! The decor is quite strange with white plastic furnishings dominating the room and the bathroom. It has a '70s Stanley Kubrick film set' feel to it, but it does look better in reality than in the photos. The bathroom had all the amenities you would need, as well as the famous electronic toilets that you would only encounter in Japan. We did not eat in the restaurants because there are many good and cheaper local ones nearby. However we did go to the bar and had some cocktails... the view was great but probably less spectacular and not as hip as the Park Hyatt bar. We found the location very convenient, actually the hotel is only a few minutes away from the subway station, so I am not sure why one of the reviewers complaint about the distance between the hotel and the station. On the whole, we were quite satisfied with our stay at this hotel. It is not a 5-star hotel, but for the price and location, it is very good value for money esp. in a city like Tokyo. P.S. Do remember to shop around for deals because you could be paying the 'official rate' and this would cost you a lot more!

<Content>Nothing special business hotel This is a massive hotel, with a very busy reception packed with business people, and so felt the atmosphere was not appropriate for a holiday maker. Rooms are clean and large with a 70s theme (not sure if this was their aim).I reckon location could be better. Even though the hotel is about 8 mins walk from the subway, it does get tiring going to and fro after a days sight seeing. I would not stay here again as I believe there are better locations to stay in Tokyo. Overall I'd say this place was average - nothing exciting or special, nor did it disappoint.And if you get the chance, try the Ninja Restaurant nearby - it is expensive but entertaining!

<Content>Great Hotel in Tokyo We stayed at the Akasaka Prince Hotel during the week of April 2. The hotel is in a perfect location for the Tokyo sites and is only steps away from the very cool subway system. The rooms are very nice and the view is spectacular. Try to get a room above the 34th floor for the best view, although they cost a little more. The price of the room was very good as compared with similar hotels in the area. The food is average in quality but high in price as are all Tokyo restaurants. The breakfast buffet is probably the best deal. A small bakery outside of the main building provides enough for a good start in the morning. The Guest Relations associates were outstanding and were essential to learn how to go to the various sites without a scheduled tour. We would defintely stay there again when we revist the delightful country of Japan in a few years.

The location is great, a minutes walk from the subway, the reception area is very white and spacious (thats not a bad thing though!) and the staff cannot do enough to help you. There is a bar/restaurants/a cafe all of which I actually didn't visit as there is so much more to see in the city but they looked nice! We paid a little extra to have a room above the 34th floor, it was well worth it as the views were stunning also helped by the fact that we had a perfect view of Mount Fuji! The bed was huge and the room very comfortable with everything that we needed. We booked through worldhotels.com which had cheaper rates than the hotel direct and the other usual travel websites.

<Content>Love this Hotel of Luxury and 5 Star Service I just got in today from a 5 days stay at this hotel I travel the world to over 45 countries and no hotel was a good as this the service, the atmosphere, the people, the location, and most of all the VIEW was just spectacular, I could not get enough of the view I got up at nights at would take a peak at the view it was just breathtaking. The staffs was so helpful even if their english is not great they do whatever they can to help you service is very prompt as well I told my cousin about this hotel and we are already planning a trip to Tokyo as she would like to experience this hotel. Also they upgraded me to a suite as I arrive late from Toronto the room was unbelievable, I fall in love with the massage chair and also the toilet seat with multiple functions, the maids doesnt bother u they come later in the afternoon to clean up. The breakfast in the hotel is very good but anything else is pricey but a few minutes up the road there are many restaurants which includes McDonalds, Tony Romas Rib and Steaks and also lots of Japanese cuisine close by you wont starve. I really love Tokyo the place is amazingly clean, people are super polite, Transportation is first class to none, no cabs though they are pricey. I develop a special love for Tokyo, it is a vast city with beautiful neon coloured buildings and with great architecture. Akasaka Prince Hotel is just a wonderful hotel and dont hesitate to stay here you wont regret it. I am a world traveller and I have it all this is the BEST. I give this hotel a 6 Star.

<Content>Great Great Great As others have stated here, this hotel is simply great. We were three adults in one room and the individual beds were top notch. When you first enter the hotel, you can tell by the immaculate white lobby with its white marble floor that you are in for a great stay. The staff was incredibly attentive and everyone spoke English. Back to the room, the largeness of it along with the huge windows giving us a spectacular view of the city made our visit to Tokyo all the better. It actually reminded me a bit of the infamous Park Hyatt hotel (at about 1/2 the price!) Nearby, there are plenty of restaurants and convenient stores to satisfy all of your hunger needs. The A/C controls in the room were the best as I have heard it is difficult to sometimes get it cold in other rooms at various hotels in Tokyo. We actually got it down in the 60's one night during our stay and we loved it in contrast to the hot and humid days we were experiencing in October. The surprising bonus this hotel was the shower. The first morning I came out of the bathroom and said to my travel mates - That has to be one of the best showers I've had while traveling in a long time. Suspicious at first, my roommates announced similar statements once they experienced it. The only negative thing I could say about this hotel (and really, it's not the hotel's fault at all) is that the location is swarmed by a lot of gaijin tourists, like us. There are a couple of other large hotels in the area so dining at night in a small quaint Japanese restaurant is often filled with many other obvious tourists. This is not a bad thing at all鈥ust a small observation after staying in other areas of Tokyo prior to this trip. If you join the Prince Hotel Club (which is free!) before booking your room, you can get a whopping discount. If I recall correctly, our final price per night was under $200USD (whereas I think it was listed on its own website and various other travel sites at around $350 USD without being a Club Member). Would I stay here again? Yes!

<Content>Very nice hotel This hotel offers great value for money, the rooms are large for Japan standards  have great views over Akasaka. The metro stop is only a couple of minutes walk  there's a lot of dining opportunities in the hotel  a few minutes walk away in Akasaka. I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel in the Middle of Tokyo After staying in the Akasaka Excel Hotel, we moved to the Prince because it was cheaper and are we glad we did! The Prince is a beautiful hotel with big, modern rooms (some with a panaoramic view of Tokyo). The service was also excellent and the price was excellent. We never ate there as there are many local dining options just down the street. Highly recommended.

<Content>Akasaka Prince, nice and convenient The Akasaka Prince had friendly hotel staff and the rooms were clean, spacious, and modern. This hotel is conveniently located close to the subway and there's plenty of good restaurants within walking distance (even a McDonald's and Starbucks for the homesick American tourist). The breakfast on the 40th floor was decent. From what I could tell, most of the hotel cuisine was Japanese style. The Souvenir shop sold beverages and snacks which was very convenient. Also, if it's raining, the hotel will lend you an umbrella for the duration of your stay. I would stay here again in the future.

<Content>Best Deal in Tokyo - Stay Here!!! This is my favorite tokyo hotel. It is worth 2-3x the price paid, which was $130 or so. The rooms are hip and fun. Location is great, right on a subway line. There's a little bit of a scene, but the real high point is the awesome modern austin powers decore, the great views and the very comfortable roomy rooms.The food in the hotel is pretty average - again the strong points are the rooms and price. There are lots of good places around the subway that is 2-3 minutes away from the hotel. I'd recommend the revolving sushi place a block away from the subway station for a quick delicious cheap meal.Again, I can't recommend this place enough. There's no other hotel I'd stay at in Tokyo.l

<Content>Highly Recommended The Akasaka Prince offers good sized rooms at reasonable rates. It is located in a lovely part of Tokyo, just opposite the New Otani. Around it are many restaurants and shops. The Diet and ministerial residences are within walking distance, so the area feels very safe and secure. The surrounding roads are wide and tree-lined. Not at all the usual image one has of Tokyo.The subway station is a a 5 minute walk away and connects to many of the tourist destinations in Tokyo.Service is very good and the staff are extremely helpful and polite.Rooms on the high floors have views of the Imperial Palace and Shinjuku. The bathroom is a bit cramped but the bed room is spacious and comfortable.We would definitely recommend it as a good value hotel in a nice location.

<Content>Great Place To Stay My Mom and I visited Tokyo from April 18 - 24, 2006 and stayed at the Akasaka Prince primarily because of the reviews from this site. We were not disappointed. The hotel's location is what makes it such a great place to stay. It's a 2 minute walk away from the Ginza and Marunouchi train lines - which meant that all of Tokyo is easily accessible. The area around the hotel is full of shops, restaurants, bakeries and even mini casino's! The hotel's amenities were great - all of the bath products were by Shishedo, which is kind of a luxury, when you think about what hotels usually offer. We stayed in a twin room and while I expected the room to be larger (at least by Western standards), it seems that the room was fairly large for a Japanese hotel. But, as we only slept there (who would want to stay in even with the great view?!?) it didin't really make much of a difference. The hotel staff spoke good (if careful) English, were courteous (the bowing takes a little getting used to) and extremely helpful - especially when helping you to arrange sight seeing activities. I'd definitely stay here again!

<Content>Really Special My husband and I stayed here for a week recently. Budget-wise I think it was well worth it as it included one of the roomiest hotel rooms in Japan, a great neon-flashing panoramic view, breakfast AND dinner and a wonderful concierge service. The concierge even went to the trouble of getting us baseball tickets for the Yomiuri Giants vs. the Hiroshima Carp. The breakfast in the Blue Gardenia (included in price of room) was very, very good. It's conveniently located near the Akasaka-Mitsue Tokyo Metro Subway stop. Just a really, really good location. When we arrived at a hotel in Kyoto that is supposedly of a higher standard I actually felt let down because it was back to business as usual without the wonderful service and frienliness of the Akasaka Prince.

<Content>Clean and value for 15,000 Yen It's definately a 3 star hotel. Considering the price for a 37 sqm room with panaromic view, it was good value plus the location. We stayed at room 3428 which is on the corner where you see the subway station and intersection. The roomwas a good size room and equivalent to a normal US hotel room. The location was a plus because it's about 15-20 minutes from all of tokyo. It's located at the Akasaka-Mitsuke station. Walk to the exit D to the end of the tunnel and go up the stairs. Cross the street and then walk across the bridge and the hotel is up on the hill to your right.Some info about Toyko:- Get the Toyko all day pass for 750 yen. This card will give you unlimited rides on all the subway lines except the Toei and JR ones. They are all you need to get all over Tokyo- Akakusa is like a little market place. There is no bargaining there. At least when we tried.- Shibuya is like a crowded Time Square in NYC. It's a crazy place. Lots of young people go there.- The secret to traveling in Japan is the luggage service (Domestic Courier). It's so cheap ($26 USD or so), you should use it to ship luggage from hotel to hotel. We used it to ship 2 large suitcases from the aiport to Prince hotel ahead of time for 2910 yen. We took an over night bag to goto hakone first and when we got back to Tokyo, the luggage was right there.We also used it to ship it to Kyoto next and it still cost 2900 yen. Almost all hotels have this service in their lobby.Travel light on the trains because it's a pain to lug the luggage up and down the station stairs and then on the trian itself. Use that luggage service. It will pay for itself! Just ship it a day ahead to get to the next place the next day.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Location We really enjoyed our stay at the Akasaka Prince Hotel. The rooms are spacious and have many amenties. The hotel is constructed such that all rooms are corner rooms (have a nice set of windows and great views). The room was very clean and the beds were reasonably comfortable. The bathroom was nice, complete with a deluxe electronic toilet! The hotel has a nice location in the business district of Akasaka. There are not too many tourist attractions in this area (although there are a decent number of restaurants and shops) but the hotel is within a block or so of the metro station. We actually enjoyed lodging in a less busy section of Tokyo to escape the noise and bustle of the city. The staff was very nice and always will to help.

<Content>Just a wonderful hotel! I chose the Akasaka Prince on the basis of the Tripadvisor reviews, and again, I was not let down. The room was clean, stylish, and had specatular views. Each room is designed as a corner room to give you a panoraic view across the city and to Fuji on a clear day.There are three restaurants to choose from for you complimentary breakfast, but the Blue Gardenia on the 40th floor has got to be the winner. The Top of Akasaka bar is also great for a nightcap and serves some pretty lethal cocktails.The Prince is right next to akasaka-mitsuke station giving easy access to harajuku, shibuya, shinjuku, ginza etc.Everyone was super friendly, and we will definetly be staying here again.

<Content>Compared this hotel with the New Otani We stayed in this hotel right before our skiing holiday and we stayed at the New Otani (just across the road) on the same trip but after we went skiing, so you could say we are well placed to compare the two hotels. We knowingly paid a high price for a triple room at the New Otani because we knew we would want a comfortable room after skiing. This was exactly what we got, a large 40sqm room (unusually large for Tokyo), well fitted out, with nice furnishings and a picture view of the Japanese garden below, the Shinjuku park in front and the office towers beyond. From the lobby right up to the room, the New Otani is definitely one star up on the Akasaka Prince, particularly the beds--which are firmer and have much nicer comforters.My tip is to insist on a room in the New Otani Tower because when we called ahead to ask what is the difference, they told us all the rooms in the Main building were about to be renovated whereas the Tower rooms are still quite new. And if you could swing it, request a room facing the Shinjuku area, which has the best view in this hotel. If you have to pay extra for breakfast, then I urge you to do so. They give you a choice of 3 restaurants but by far the most stunning is the Top of the Tower on the 40th floor where on a sunny day (which is quite often between Nov to Feb), you would not want to leave.While the New Otani maybe more luxurious and comfortable, when it comes to service the Akasaka Prince wins hands down--from its concierge, business centre and reservations, all were too willing to please and efficient. In contrast, we felt the staff at the New Otani were a bit aloof. My final tip is this, all double/twin rooms at the Akasaka Prince is 37sqm whereas in the New Otani Tower, they are 27sqm.Since I think both hotels are similarly priced and location wise they are right opposite each other (both are in one of the best neighbourhoods in Tokyo), if it's comfort and luxury you want, then choose the New Otani. If it's service and room size which concerns you then go for the Akasaka Prince (say if you have a child for intance, the 3 or you would be more comfortable at the Akasaka Prince since their double beds are 200cm or 79 inches wide). At the New Otani, you would need a triple room which would cost quite a bit more. We had emailed the Akasaka Prince concierge a bunch of questions on where to go, what to see and where to eat before arrival and when we checked in, they had printed out maps and clear directions in English for each of the places we enquired about ready for us, that's service !!

<Content>Did not like it at all! We stayed at the Akasaka Prince at the beginning of January 2006 for 3 nights. We initally booked for 6 nights but decided to leave earlier because I could not warm to the place. It is an extraordinary place but has definitely seen better times. The staff is very attentive, speaks excellent english and is very helpful and knowledgable. However, I did not like the room and floor we were on. I was pregnant at the time and we asked for a non-smoking room which they kindly provided to us. Unfortunately, the aircon was pumping stinking air out. Not nice! There was a big stain on the sofa in the room and the entire room looked tired and tatty. Our room was extremly hot and we were told that this could not be changed since they would turn all aircon off during the winter. No idea where the smoky air it was pumping out came from. SInce the hotel was really busy they could not give us another room. The smell on the floors of desinfectant was revolting.The breakfast place on the 40th floor has terrific views. However, you have to que to get in. The hotel is far to vast for my personal taste. I still think it is a good location with good transport facilities and if you are less fussy than I am you are definitly ok. But it is not for me.

<Content>The Prince- worthy of its name I was lucky enough to have been able to go to Tokyo on a long business this past trip, and we stayed at the Akasaka Prince hotel.It is an amazing place and is one of the best places to be in the city. The hotel sits pretty much right above one of the largest subway stations in Tokyo, so transportation to all reaches is VERY easy. But that is only if you want to leave. With a bevy of excellent restaurants within walking distance, not to mention the Imperial Palace Grounds only a 10 minute walk away, this hotel has the PERFECT setting.Check-in was a breeze with the bellman taking our bags and the people who checked us in were very nice and spoke excellent English. The lobby is quite nice with lots of sitting room for people and a grand piano being played by someone. To describe how it looks, I know you may laugh, but it reminded me exactly of the Fortress of Solitude in the Superman movies. Am I crazy? Maybe, but thats how I saw it.The room they led me to was unlike nothing I had ever seen. Think 'Jetsons' and you kind of have a good idea as to the room. Almost everything is built in, from the sofa, to the vanity to the desk, but the room was a good size for Tokyo and the views were fantastic. The bathroom felt modular, but very cool, and I have NEVER seen such a sophisticated toilet in all my life.I never ate dinner in the hotel and you dont have to with access to all of the restaurants Akasaka has to offer. And, unlike the hotel, dining in Tokyo isnt as expensive as I had thought it was going to be. About $25 a person for an excellent dinner, not too shabby. One thing they included with my room and if you have the chance to take advantage of is complimentary breakfast. It is on the 40th floor and has FANTASTIC views of all of Tokyo, not to mention an excellent spread. They had a Western breakfast as well as a traditional Japanese breakfast that I really enjoyed.There are only a couple of problems that I really noticed with the hotel. First off, I would have thought such a business friendly hotel would have high-speed internet access included, but its an extra $15 a night, which is a little steep. My other quibble has to do with the cleaning staff. You have the option to have your room cleaned or to put the 'Do Not Disturb' sign up, right? However, if you leave the DND sign up for a couple of days, you will start being pestered by the cleaning staff to clean your room and it is really annoying. If I have DND up, I dont want my room cleaned, please dont bother me. I guess my other minor problem has to do with the rooms. They are good size, but it looks as though they were designed for the future that never came. A little too 'Lost in Space' for my taste, but at this point this is splitting hairs.All in all, my stay at the Prince was really quite nice. It is in a perfect location, with pretty much all of Tokyo at your fingertips, but with its spacious rooms, you wont feel cramped catching up on some jet-lag or just relaxing. The Prince is a great offering in Tokyo, and at a relatively reasonable price no less. Granted, amongst Tokyo hotels it is no King, but this hotel is a very polished and distinguished Prince.FYINotes- the last time I went they did not have card access to the rooms, it was still done by key. Very expensive keys. So if you're forgetful about keys or lose them alot, do yourself a favor and give them to the front desk before you leave and it will be waiting for you when you return.

<Content>Great views and location This is a beautiful, modern hotel with large rooms and wonderful views, in the very nice Kioi-cho/Akasaka area. Service, location, and rooms are all great, and it is built to handle earthquakes. The primary drawback is the lack of broadband internet in the rooms (but it is well configured for dial up access).Rooms: as other reviews note, they are a bit space-age, decked out in shiny white with huge windows and great views. It is built so every room is like a 鈥渃orner鈥?room with spectacular views. The best rooms are high floors with views to the south; we had a gorgeous view of Mt. Fuji over Tokyo several mornings. Our king room had two desks, one configured for easy setup of a computer with dial up Internet (go figure - a 5-star hotel without broadband! - but it can be nice to be free of the Internet distraction), and a large and comfortable built-in sofa hugging the wall by the windows.Service: like all great Tokyo hotels, the service is outstanding. The staff will grab your bags as soon as they see you, escort you to the room, and refuse tips (as they should, since service charge is part of the rate). The concierge is exceptionally helpful, with maps in English showing many things available in the area, ranging from cash machines to supermarkets to restaurants to Japanese public baths. One minor annoyance was that ice was only available from room service 鈥?and with a $5 charge!Location: the Prince is in Kioi-cho, on the edge of Akasaka-Mitsuke area. This is a great area with many good restaurants. It is near many government offices, parliament, prime minister鈥檚 residence, etc., as well as Japan locations of many international companies. Thus, it is upscale, foreigner-friendly, safe, and most importantly very well-connected with transportation. There are 2 subway stops just a block from the hotel, with a total of 5 subway lines! Also, there is a JR light rail station just 10 min. away by foot (and a nice walk along a park and college campus). For some unfathomable reason (perhaps because of the sheer number of hotels), many of my friends and colleagues stay in Shinjuku instead of Akasaka. If you like noise, bad food, dingy nightlife, train stations that are impossible to navigate, and millions of people crowding you, then Shinjuku is for you. I prefer the quieter, higher quality experience in Akasaka.Comparison of New Otani and Akasaka Prince: basically, this is a choice between room size  views at the Prince, and convenience and services at the New Otani. The New Otani is a famous, well-regarded landmark hotel across the street from the Prince. I鈥檝e stayed there many times, and the available services are amazing (hundreds of shops, dozens of restaurants, post office for cash, and on and on). The New Otani shops range from convenient to exquisite, and the availability of everything from a convenience store and deli to multiple breakfast buffets is great for weary travelers. The Otani is a favorite of visiting dignitaries, but its rooms are not as spacious nor have the uniformly great views of the Prince. One specific advantage of the New Otani for business travelers is that the rooms have broadband Internet available. Beds are more comfortable at the Prince than the New Otani (where they are too hard for my taste, like many in Asia).Finally, do not eat dinner in this or any other Tokyo hotel unless you鈥檙e exhausted. True, the restaurants are great, but it is a lot more fun to get out and go to restaurants in neighboring Akasaka and Kioicho. To get to the main Akasaka restaurant area, exit from the lobby and walk down to the moat. Cross over the moat toward the Akasaka-mitsuke subway station. When you cross over towards the station, keep going straight on the first street over from the station (not the big street in front of the station, but one street further south). There are dozens and dozens of restaurants of every type; just browse until you see one that strikes your fancy. Two tips. First, a phenomenal restaurant recommendation (in Kioi-cho, not Akasaka) is Elio Locanda, a world-class Italian restaurant. To get there from the hotel, exit through the back (guest house) door, and follow the street up the hill 2 blocks to the first significant intersection. Turn right and go about 3 blocks. Elio has an ornate entrance on your right 鈥?but be warned, it is expensive (~$80 per person) and reservations are essential (but can be made in English). Second, go places on the subway (Metro). The stations are close and it is not hard to figure out if you鈥檙e willing to work through the initial confusion. Once you figure it out, it鈥檚 well worth it and makes any visit to Tokyo much, much more enjoyable. One tip: buy the 1000 yen 鈥渙ne day open ticket鈥? That will let you ride all subway lines, unlimited, for a whole day 鈥?much easier than repeatedly trying to figure out amounts and having to buy tickets.
