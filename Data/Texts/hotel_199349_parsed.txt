<Content>Poorly managed Hotel and Rude Staff I got a great rate at this hotel through a discount travel website, but by the end of my stay I felt I had paid too much. To begin with, I arrived late in the evening, and the fellow who checked me in to my room was incredibly rude. He was unable to get authorization on my credit card, and refused to let me into my room, and would offer no suggesting as to why the card wasn't working, except to say that perhaps I had no credit left-this was ridiculous, as I had over 拢1000 credit available. He wouldn't even tell me how much he was trying to authorise!! The fellow was unhelpful and rude, so I went next door to their sister property, and the young lady at their registration desk was very helpful. She explained to me that the fellow was trying to authorise on one cent on my card, which is why it was not working--one cent is less than one pence, so there was no way that would work. I went back to my hotel and asked the fellow to try again, but he refused, so returned to the other hotel, and the young lady charged my credit card for the amount of the entire stay, over 400 Euros, and accompanied me next door, where she produced the receipt, and instructed the fellow to give me my keys and let me into my room. The next ridiculous situation occurred a few days later--I was just out of the shower, getting ready to go to dinner and realised that I had locked the keys to my suitcase inside when I left earlier in the day! I slipped on the clothes I had been wearing all day, and ran down to the desk to ask for a screwdriver or other tool to break the lock--it wasn't substantial, but would require some tool or other to break. The front desk had not so much as a screwdriver available, and no access to any tools. Not even keys to a maintenance or housekeeping closet. The hotel next door was no help either, and in the end, I ended up visiting every hotel within 6 blocks before I found one that had an emergency tool kit at the registration desk. They kindly lent me a pair of pliers, and I returned it later in the evening with a promise to stay there when I returned to Frankfurt, which I intend to keep. The room at the colour hotel was neat and clean, but I found the staff unfriendly, and they seemed largely unconcerned with the two situations above, which I feel is a total shame...hotels should be havens for travellers, places where they can feel safe, relaxed, and looked after. I felt safe in the colour hotel, (despite its location--convenient for the train station, but smack in the middle of the red light district) and it was a quiet, comfortable room, but I felt a bit like an interloper the entire time--whenever I needed anything, the staff seemed annoyed at having to help me--even giving directions or restaurant suggestions seemed to be over-taxing. The Colour Hotel would be a fantastic place to stay if they had a complete revamp of their customer service policies, got a more friendly staff, and made sure the staff could access the housekeeping and maintenance areas of the hotel, in order to provide for the guests needs!

<Content>Fuss free and comfortable stay I arrived at Frankfurt train station early in the morning and was a little confused. Luckily, the tourist info centre had a good map and gave me directions to the hotel. Turns out it is just across the street from one of the station exits. I found the hotel in 3 mins and deposited my bags quickly without any problems. The staff let me check in 2 hours early and to my surprise, the room was very clean and everything looked new and modern. I was a little apprehensive about the shared bathroom, and to my dismay there were only one bathroom on the second floor and another on the fifth floor. However, it was nice and clean, and I never had to wait to use one.Overall, I liked the place, cool and quiet, size just right for a single traveller on a budget. Not for the party kind or those who expect to be fussed over though.

<Content>Wonderful cozy hotel Pro:Best stay during our European trip, although a little more expensive than the hotel in France and Spain. The inner design of the room is nice. The staff is friendly. Very closed to Frankfurt Hbf. If you want to go to Heidelberg or Koln for a single day trip, this must be a good choice. There are many different types of food in its neighborhood, which are not expensive.Con:The window of our room is shabby. The hotel is near the red-light district, but safe in the day.

<Content>Good value for money but we found many Frankfurt hotels to be good value Double room 鈧?9. Breakfast extra at 鈧? per person (in National Hotel breakfast room next door 鈥?same breakfast as National who charge 鈧? per person)Good value for money and excellent location about 100m from Frankfurt station. But we found many Frankfurt hotels to be good value, especially compared to France and Italy. Also see reviews on two other hotels in same area all very close to station - Excelsior Hotel where we also stayed (even better value at 鈧?7 for double room including breakfast, free minibar and much more included)- National Hotel (attached to Colour Hotel and managed jointly 鈥?4 star hotel for only 鈧?9 for double room plus breakfast at 鈧? per person 鈥?really inexpensive for a good quality hotel)Large room, big bathroom, very comfortable. No complaints at all, for the price bracket.

<Content>Good Hotel in Frankfurt I arrived from an early morning flight from Hong Kong, mainly worried about 2 things; first, how to find the hotel; and second, on whether I could check-in immediately, as most hotels require a 2pm check-in time. After taking the short train ride from the airport to the main train station (Frankfurt Hbf), it was a mere 8-10 minute walk to the hotel. After being warmly greeted by the hotel receptionist, I had a bit of a scare, when I was informed that my reservation was for the night before! I then showed the receptionist a copy of the booking I had made with them online, which showed the correct check-in date. The receptionist could not understand what went wrong, but instead of giving me a hard time, she just decided to re-enter all my information, as she said the had rooms available, and that I would not have to wait for their normal 2pm check-in time! I am not sure though what would have happened if they did not have rooms free then. Rooms were slightly bigger than those rooms found in a Japanese business hotel. Clean and comfortable bed, clean toilet. Just wish they could offer free wifi internet inside room (wifi internet charge was EUR11.50, 24-hours only; free internet use in their business center located in lobby). Good deal, good service. Will definitely stay there again when I return to Frankfurt.

<Content>good for this price Hotel clean, staff not bad however they couldn't find a key to my room, so I had to wait 20 minutes. Finally they gave me another room :-S. Lounge in the hotel is kinda small and it is better to go to the adjacent hotel for a beer or so... Most important is good price and good location.

<Content>Decent value Stayed here for a few nights, to recover from Oktoberfest. Located across from the Hauptbahnhof, which is very convenient. Like most tourist-class hotels in Frankfurt, it is near the redlight district. (Luckily, nowhere near as bad as it used to be !) . . However, its around the corner from the Le Meridien, which didn't make me feel so bad, as I paid a lot less to stay in the same neighborhood. . . Rooms were okay, but looked like they could use some renovation. The staff were friendly. This hotel is actually run partially by the Hotel Continental next door, but is managed as a hostel. Having stayed at other hotels in the area before on previous visits to Frankfurt, this hotel is okay. Its a great value for the money, and thankfully, not a hot-sheet hotel.

<Content>Budget Friendly, wrong side of town! Okay, so this hotel was budget friendly and clean. But it is near the trainstation (not the best part of town) and the rooms are very dark. When I checked in the room was not cleaned yet, no big deal, they got on it right away. Bed was comfortable, plenty of room (I booked a single room). The theme of the hotel was great. The lobby was great, very modern and colorful with computers downstairs for internet access. Not bad for what I paid, but the location is questionable (although it is great if you are just spending one night and need to get to the train station right away-which is what I did).

<Content>ideal for budget travel My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. It is conviniently located across from the main train station and is therefore steps away from Hauptbahnhof U- and S-Bahn stop, from where you can access the more touristic city locations and the financial district. My only concern was that on the city map, the hotel looked very close to the red light district, which covers a part of Kaiserstrasse and the surrounding streets. I found this to be no problem. It is true that there are some strip clubs, adult shops and videotheks, but even right next to them you can find decent, normal looking bars and restaurants. Moreover, you can totally avoid walking on Kaiserstrasse if you take the metro or tram, or you can instead walk along the Munchener Strasse, which runs parallel to Kaiserstrasse and is host to many ethic grocery stores, delis and kebap houses. Very exotic actually! As to the hotel itself, it is exactly like it looks on the pictures. The reception desk and area is painted white and decorated with pillows in bright colors on a comfy looking ottoman. Very trendy-looking! There is a lounge at the back, where breakfast is served in the mornings. We didn't take breakfast, which was an extra 7 euros, so I don't know about the lounge or the breakfast. The 5 floors of the hotel are also color-coded, one color for each floor. On every floor, the room number is painted with giant letters on the door, cute. The room is again decorated exactly like in the pictures, blocks of squares in different solid colors are painted on a crisp white wall to create a hip and trendy-looking space, which I think worked well. Only problem is, the room itself is very very small. There is really little room between the double bed and the TV stand/desk, so if you want to enjoy a spacious hotel room, this is not the one. The bathroom was relatively big, compared to the room itself. No hair dryer, but soap and shampoo was provided. The towels and linens were crisp clean, as well as the room itself, no bad suprises there. As far as I observed, there is no A/C in the room, so it may be relatively warm in the summer. Even though our room was overlooking the busy street and the train station, the noise was no problem. There is only one elevator in the hotel, which wasn't working the morning of our check-out. The hotel reception was very friendly and honest. My husband forgot his cell phone in the room, which he realized half an hour after checking out from the hotel. We went back and recovered it. This is a clean and comfy budget hotel, conviniently located for easy access to many attractions in Frankfurt. I would stay here again.

<Content>Value for Money Booking from the website was no problem. We booked a 2-bedroom room and got a 3 bedroom. Space was great for the two of us. Hotel is located next to a main road with Tram and our room faced the main road. In the night we could hear the noise of the late and early trams and emergency vehicles with there load siren. This was the only downside. Everything else was what we expected for this price. The breakfast was simple, but complete and the coffee was great (As a coffee freak a good thing). Free flow of drinks and food for European breakfast. They also had pastries, something I didn't expected. Our breakfast was in the hotel itself. I understood from the counter staff that the breakfast could also be in the hotel next door in case of the colour hotel is fully booked. The breakfast room is small and cannot accommodate all travels in that case.)The counter staff where friendly and their English was simple but good enough for the necc3ecarry. Location was right next to the main train station with direct connection to the airport. No need for taxi to the station (save some euro). One minor point was the let luggage. They place this in a room open to the reception not locked. Although we didn鈥檛 feel comfortable with this, but had no choice as out flight was late night. No problems when we came back to pick up our suitcases as everything was there. All together a great hotel for the price we paid.

<Content>Large bathroom! I'm a solo, female Australian traveller, aged 51, who stayed at the Colour Hotel for two nights in early December. This hotel is very good value for money. It is centrally located right near the Hauptbahnhof (main train station) where there is a range of fairly cheap, but delicious, eating venues. A continental breakfast at the Colour Hotel will only set you back 5 euros extra per night (and it's well worth taking because there is plenty to eat in a modern, rather relaxing environment). A feature of my room on the blue level was the surprisingly large bathroom. The shower recess had a curtain rather than a screen so there was actually room to move about in the shower while washing my hair -- quite a luxury compared to most hotels I discovered in Europe and the UK. There was a long bench above the toilet and hand basin that allowed heaps of room for cosmetics etc; quite a change from having to put them on the floor in most other hotels. I even managed to dry some underwear in this bathroom overnight because they provided a little rack especially for doing such necessary chores.The bed linen was crisp and clean and the europillow was solid enough to get a good night's sleep on a mattress that was clean but not exactly the most comfortable bed in the world because it dipped slightly in the middle. Otherwise, I have no complaints. The room was quiet and I was undisturbed at any time while in it. The TV offers CNN and the BBC and even a bit of local flavour (try watching the New Zealand film 'Whale Rider' dubbed into German!).The staff, overall, were very helpful. They all speak English rather fluently (like most German people in Frankfurt). The woman serving breakfast advised me of the fabulous Sunday Christmas market and gave me explicit directions about getting there on the train. The young guy on the desk at night was particularly helpful because he helped me sort out the car hire problems I created for myself before leaving Australia. We had quite a long chat in English about the intricacies of getting around Frankfurt independently as a traveller with only a basic knowledge of the German language. Another bonus of the Colour Hotel: there is free, unlimited internet access in the foyer (where you can also smoke cigarettes if you want to, although the German parliament is about to pass anti-smoking legislation that might prohibit that in the future). Overall, I thought this hotel was a great little place to stay. You can love or hate the postmodernist (and, in my view, somewhat bland) decor. and take advantage of all the other positive aspects of the hotel. It is great value for money, especially if you're on a tight budget.

<Content>Excellent Budget Hotel Have just got back from an enjoyable three night stay in the Colour Hotel. It is definately the best budget hotel I have stayed in in Frankfurt. The hotel is in a great location near the main train station but away from the dodgy shops and bars in the area!The hotel is modern and bright with each of the four floors in the hotel being decorated in a different colour. Rooms are spacious, reasonably stylish with a good bathroom and shower. Hotel staff are friendly and accommodating. You can also get a good German buffet breakfast in the hotel next door for 鈧? - bargain!We booked through Expedia and got a really good price. If you are looking for a base to visit Frankfurt at a good price where you can also get a good nights sleep then the Colour Hotel is the place to go!
