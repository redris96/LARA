<Content>good location I am very happy with my choice of Hotel Nicolaas Witsen. The staf at the reception gave me a warm welcome and during my stay of 5 nights It was like home. The room was very new and very comfortable. I stay a lot in hotels in Europe and the beds in this hotel are the best till so far. The breakfast is also good, especialy for an included one. I really can recommand this hotel to everybody.

<Content>7 days the same breakfast I spent 7 nights in Amsterdam in the Nicolaas Witsen Hotel last september. The hotel is in a good position and the staff is quite nice. The rooms are very very small and the bathrooms also but they are very clean.The thing the bothered me the most was the breakfast: It is the same every single day! This might not be a problem if you are staying 1-2 days but for 7 days in a row .....it was to much! The same2-3 cheese and pastrami and 1 egg .........no option of choosing or changing.

<Content>avoid this place if you want privacy and good service Read this if you're thinking about staying at this place, do not be fooled by the positive reviews because those people have probably never been to a decent hotel.Well first of all this is not a hotel. It's some people renting out low quality apartments at hotel rates but with no service and you don't even get a room key! Well you do get a key but you can only use it within the hotel premises. Incredibly stupid! So every time you leave the hotel you have to turn over the key to the front desk. And every time you get back to the hotel, tired or drunk or with someone that you want to spend the night with, you have to ring the bell and wait for one of the two very unpleasant night clerks to come and open the door for you. Wow, that's exactly how people want their nights in Amsterdam to end, with a frowning arab night clerk unlocking the door in slow motion....splendidNo privacy. No service. The rooms are extremely basic, the furniture worn out and old, the carpet smelled really bad and the breakfast was disgusting.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Spot! After reading the previous reviews, we were pretty confident about staying here. You should be too....Location...It is in a really good spot...on the right side of Dam Square. It's on a quiet but safe street. The trams are very near and very regular. we used to get the 16 or 25 (i think) from the other side of Dam at times when we were too tired, but it can be walked easily . It was about a 5/ 10 minute walk from Dam. No bothers. Just near the Heineken Brewery. The Hotel...The room was really clean, comfortable and spacious enough. We stayed in a triple room (Room 17). We were very happy with the bathroom everything was spotless and clean towels every day. Breakfast...Continental breakfast, oj, tea/coffee, boiled eggs, bread, jams, crackers. Good to keep you going 'til lunch..Nightlife...Leidsplein, Cafe de Waard is good for music. The irish bar was alright, even though we sat outside. When the bars close at 1 a.m. ask any barman where Biblos is. It's just around the corner but make sure you go around the right corner. When Biblos closes at 3a.m. ask those barmen where Bourbon St. is. It's all great craic. All of the locals are really friendly and really know their languages. Can't wait to go back to Amsterdam and will definately stay here again! P.S. Make sure you go to Volendam and Marken to see windmills, cheese farm and clogs and a ferry ride with Lindburgh Excursions. Must do a canal ride as well.

<Content>Very Nice Quiet Hotel Being our first time in amsterdam, i think we picked the perfect hotel, in a great location just close enough to the centre, all the action of the centre was located 10-15 mins walk along one long road (and the heineken experience literaly around the corner) cutting out the need for public transport.the hotel was very well kept, the rooms were in imaculate condition and of a nice size.the staff were very freindly and helpfull, and breakfast was served quickly, to a high standard. A small selection of food and drinks were available at the bar, which were served around the clock which was a handy feature, if returning later on.I have no doubt that I will be staying with this hotel again and I recomend anyone in doing so.

<Content>Comfortable and well located Previously in Amsterdam we have stayed close in near Central Station but this time went a little further out on good advice. This hotel isa straight line 10 minute stroll along an attractive canalside to Rembrandt Square - and from there 5 more minutes to city centre. The hotel staff are welcoming and helpful: our room was clean and fresh with a modern (if small) bathroom: the breakfast of egg, cheese, meats and lovely bread selection was excellent. It sits in a quiet street off a main artery.We took the Airport Connexxions bus to and from hotel - from airport it was a slow process as more people wanted the service than they hadthe capacity to provide; but return was on time and only 20 minutes to airport. If you have luggage this is the way to go - but if you can manage it, you are much better taking the train in from the airport to Central Station and then either the 4 or 25 tram to Freidrichsplein. The tram stops are just 50 metres from the hotel's street.If you want to avoid the noisy and overpriced centre for dinner, there are two local restaurants we would be happy to recommend to anyone. Thney are located about 200 metres along the main street (to the left) and sit close by each other. One is an Italian (live piano playing and owner occasionally sings!!) called La Storia Della Vita. The other a traditional Dutch called Van Aanderen which would be a wonderful choice for a special occasion dinner, a bit pricey but worth every cent for both food and extraordinary service and ambience. Reservations at both are recommended.Also close to the hotel (opposite the 25 tram stop) is a lovely cafe called Cafe Kale - like a tradional brown cafe which serves the most wonderful Apple Cake with coffee (and a full range of other snacks/meals and drinks). The young staff are as delightful as the fare they serve. My wife left a ring in the toilet and when we returned an hour later, they had it behind the bar for her.We were reminded this trip just how lovely Amsterdam can be when one avoids the crowds in the centre.

<Content>Lovely quiet hotel We stayed at the Nicolaas Witsen for 3 nights and found it to be a great little hotel. When you arrive in Amsterdam take the train from the airport to Amsterdam Central Station and then get the number 4 tram this stops at Fredrik Plein which is about 2 minutes from the hotel - really easy to find. The hotel is very clean and the staff really friendly. The room was small but comfortable, with a toilet and shower - very clean - the room also had a TV. There is a small bar which stays open till late. The breakfast consists of friut juice, tea and coffee a boiled egg and various bread and jams, cheese and ham - its just enough to get you through the morning. The hotel is in a very quiet street, however in the surrounding area of the hotel there are bars and restaurants and the hotel is 2 minutes from the canals. The hotel is extremely quiet you could hear a pin drop during the night - best nights sleep i've had in years! I would return to this hotel and recommed it to anyone wanting to visit this beautiful city, the hotel is in a great location - about 15 minute walk into the centre - with loads of bars, shops and restauarnts along the way. Visit the Heineken Brewary if you get the chance - its wonderful, costs 11 euro but you het 3 free drinks and a gift at the end (not telling you what it is but is useful!) the tour is great with loads of hands on things and great for the kids too. Amsterdam itself is lovely with loads of shops, its really clean and we didn't feel threatened at all and really easy to get round, take a boat trip for 7 euro it lasts an hour and you get to see loads of the lovely buildings, all in all a great place and well worth a visit - we shall return and stay again at this hotel

<Content>Hotel Nicolaas Witsen Amsterdam This hotel had everything we were looking for. It was very clean and tidy, it was conveniently placed yet very peaceful. A short walk along the canals brought us to the city centre but several trams were also available. The Hotel Nicolaas Witsen staff were friendly and obliging and the price was sensible. The Connexxions Airport Shuttle (very reliable) delivered us to the hotel and returned us to the airport without any hassle. Within easy walking distance of the hotel we found several good eating places namely Vamos a Ver in Govert Flinckstraat, Eetcafe in the same street and De Waaghals vegetarian restaurant in Frans Halsstraat. The city itself is extremely interesting if a little dirty. There is a shortage of public conveniences and a few permanent city maps would have been useful. Thank you to the people of Amsterdam for your friendliness to these two senior citizens. Mr and Mrs W from Denmark April 2007

<Content>Super Clean! Clean and comfortable with a very friendly and helpful staff.Our only intention was to sleep and this hotel was perfectly acceptable in that respect. If you're looking for luxury--look elsewhere. Our room was quite dorm-like. Exceptionally clean.Breakfast was basic but served quickly.A bit difficult to find as their website featured only driving directions. Check with the hotel for exact walking directions from the tram or be certain that your map has this small street labled.

<Content>perfect placing OK so it's not the Ritz but both myself and my boyfriend found the hotel and staff pleasant.It was a little difficult to find on our first day (the cycle taxi we took had to circle twice) but there was a sign off of the main road.The location of the hotel was perfect for ambling around the city. It is just across the bridge from the Heineken Museum, 5 minutes away from the Van Gogh Museum, 5 minutes from Rembrandtsplein (where several restaurants are found) and an average walk into the centre took us about 15 minutes (and to Amsterdam train station dragging bags took about 20 minutes).Breakfast was basic but satisfied (Boiled Egg, Selection of Breads, Cheese and Meats) The room was all you want really: bed, TV, cupboards, shower and toilet and was clean and fresh. All i will say is we stayed in a room out the front of the building and when we had the window open you could hear quite a lot of background noise (but not being used to living in a city i'm not sure how normal that is).Overall a really nice little hotel. You get what you pay for.

<Content>It Was Okay it is very difficult to find this hotel and even the people who lives around it, dont know it! and the street where it is the hotel is not so nice like in the picture.the room is okey, is clean, tiny, has a nice bathroom, but the walls are very thin so you can listen almost everything and i think it isn t that close to the main places at least not walking, and you can get lost. the location is the problem but if you are traveling in a group maybe it wouldn t be!

<Content>A good no frills hotel We arrived early at the hotel (9am), aware that check in was at 2pm and were surprised and pleased that our room was ready for us.The room was quite basic and the bathroom was small, but everywhere was exceptionally clean.Breakfast consisted of boiled egg and a variety of bread - which was fine, but some fresh fruit would have been good.The hotel is a family run business, we found the staff pleasant and accommodating.The hotel is in a good location, 5 minute walk from the Rijksmuseum and Heinekein Eexperience (we recommend both) and a fifteen minute walk or a few minutes on the tram from the centre of Amsterdam.We throughly enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Facilities decent, customer service nil One soft boiled egg and bread with a live worm in it is considered breakfast in the Netherlands, if I was thinking I should have taken a picture with my camera to post? Beware of the Arab night clerk who had a very nasty temperment and had no qualms showing it, in fact he was that way with my wife an international call. All of these incidents were reported to management to no avail. I've travelled extensively and received far superior treatment in third world countries.

<Content>good hotel well located for museum The hotel is located not far from the major painting museum (walking distance) and close to the city center (tram or walk). The rooms are clean and confortable. The street is calm and rooms are also available on the back of the hotel situated over a small garden. This is a pleasant stay in Amsterdam not in the center of the city but sufficiently close to make all the visit walking. Breakfast is included in the price and large enough to make only a small break for lunch.

<Content>Charmless; not worth the money I stayed at the Nicolaas Witsen for three nights and this trip confirmed my belief that there is a vast range of two-star hotels out there!! I thought 100 euros for a double room was excessive considering that this place was akin to a Motel 6. It was clean, with basic features, but it was utterly charmless. Breakfast - a couple pieces of Wonder Bread, a slice of cheese, and an egg - was served by surly waitresses who looked really annoyed to be working at the hotel. The rest of the staff wasn't much friendlier.The Nicolaas Witsen will do in a pinch, as it is fairly centrally located and clean, but you would be much better off trying to find a more interesting, charming place for your money.

<Content>Good location, but lacking in ambience . This hotel is well priced given it's convenient location in the Museum district and it's close proximity to transport. We found the rooms small and smoky , but were told by the rather unfriendly staff that non smoking rooms did not exist. Bathroom was tiny and not very clean. Heating in the room had been disabled and was not available , staff (rather unfriendly!)told us that the cold season was over! Breakfast was OK. This would be a good place to stay if you are a smoker who is only looking for a bed to crash in and do not intend spending much time in your hotel.

<Content>No Welcome I picked this hotel because its reasonably cheap and the recommendations on trip advisor are positive. I found the hotel to be slightly above average due to having a lift and tv in the bedroom, but what was dissapointing was the staff, who were not friendly didnt smile (they never looked happy)which was uncomftable when you are sitting eating breakfast. When we arrived at the hotel no one said welcome to hotel no one asked us if we had reservations or what are names were or offered any advice about trips etc.I would visit this hotel again only if I was strapped for cash.

<Content>Good bu! This was my second stay at this clean, friendly and convenient place. However, due to excessive external night noise, with the windows open for ventilation, and a high level of internal night noise it would be unfare to give a better rating than only 3 stars. During this stay the night noise was predictable as it came from guests who indicated a general disregard for other guests. I may have picked bad dates to stay it deserves a fourth star and I will try again. (once)

<Content>Quiet, Clean, Close to Attractions-- Booked 2 nigts on the internet--sight unseen. November 13,14, 2004. A bit difficult to find. Quiet, our room was at street level behind the reception area, clean, modern, all staff very polite and extremely helpful. Within walking distance to shops, museums, restaurants, casino, Hard Rock Cafe, and other attractions. Would recommend it. It is a small hotel with large hotel appeal.

We found it to be in the best possible location : close enough to the night life without being intrusive and near to many museums and other such places of interest. The room was small but very clean and the staff were helpful and friendly. However.......if you are not keen on lifts, beware of the stairs! We will definitely return.

<Content>OK if you're not in your room very much! The Nicolaas Witsen was not bad ... It's kind of modern and not in a bad location. Perhaps I just enjoy a different type of hotel (more cosy and smaller too). The staff were friendly and the breakfast was very good. So - there was nothing wrong with it, for the money it was good value.If you're not in your room overmuch it's not bad, it's just very small and rather plain, that's not a criticism per se just the facts.
