<Content>A little hotel with a lot of heart! We started our honeymoon in Mexico with a 3 night stay at the Habita. We managed to get a good internet rate (I don't know if we would have been so happy if we had paid the rack rate). The restaurant was great and we really liked the staff. Breakfast was particularly good and we had a delicious dinner there too. The chef was amazing! One night we had room service and that was really nice too. It is a very well designed hotel and we had a standard room. Although it wasn't massive, it was good for our purposes and is certainly very modern. We liked the toiletries provided. There was no view to speak of, but that wasn't a problem for us. It is central and easy to get around. We walked around a lot or got taxis and the subway and we always felt safe.The bar and swimming pool at the top were very cool, but we never went there or used the pool. It was useful to have access to internet on two PCs.We moved onto the W hotel for the last three nights. Although the W is more impressive, we liked the personality of the Habita. It is much smaller and less glamorous but has more heart. We loved Mexico City and would recommend it to anyone, there is a great mix of restaurants, museums and culture.

<Content>Very Nice... Very nice hotel in a GREAT area. The rooms are clean and very chic. Some of the best restaurants are on the same street as the hotel as is some of Mexico Citys best shopping. BEWARE of room 45, it is directly under one of the LOUDEST tredmills the fitness center has. The thumping starts at 6am and ends at 10pm.

<Content>Lovely staff! After a seven day stay at the Habita, we're loving it!!The staff are warm and accommodating. Roman, the concierge, is especially helpful. As architects, we were captivated by the innovative design details of the hotel and found the neighborhood interesting architecturally. When a tour of the Barragan studio was shown as full on line, the hotel made last minute arrangements to successfully get us in and I'm grateful- it's not to be missed. The hotel also provided us with a very knowledgeable guide and driver for a tour of the pyramids of Teotihuacan- do not visit Mexico City without this side trip!Breakfast at the hotel is delicious- loved the fresh fruit! Booking this hotel at the Tablet Hotel site proved to provide the best rates.

<Content>Cool, Modern Boutique Hotel We stayed at Habita for 4 nights in August 2007. This is a modern boutique hotel and you would have no idea you were in Mexico by the decoration and style of the hotel --however the micro-lobby did have a bottle of tequilla, limes and glasses set up for guests to have shots (gratis) while they waited for the elevator which we thought was a nice local touch!The staff seemed very young but eager to be helpful--they arranged for a small group tour for us to the pyramids with almost no notice (worth it) and gave us maps, ordered taxis etc with a smile.We loved the boutique-y modern rooms  friendly staff and would recommend Habita to someone who likes cool  fashionable hotels though for our next trip to Mexico City we'd probably stay in a hotel that was a little less slick and had a little more soul of the city.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Habita is an amazing hotel located in a cool and central neighbourhood in Mexico city. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. When our taxi arrived at the door the doorman were waiting to take our luggage and welcome us to the hotel. When we checked in at reception we were upgraded from a standard room to a superior and when we asked for a late check out at 5pm on our final day we were not charged. The hotel is beautiful with tasteful minimal style rooms, a great rooftop bar, nice (but small) pool area and a great ground floor bar  restaurant serving top class food and a good selection of wine. This all made for a really enjoyable stay and by far the best experience we had in Mexico. What most impressed us overall about Habita was the friendly and excellent staff. Everyone seemed genuinely friendly and happy and all were incredibly nice. Nothing that was asked for was too much trouble and the service in the bar, restaurant and at reception was fantastic. For this I imagine that management deserves a lot of credit and this hotel refreshingly seems to be really well managed. Finally for the location, style, service, food and rooms the hotel is very good value for money particularly if you book online.

<Content>Great hotel, but sneaky tactics If I had written this review before check-out Habita would have, without doubt, received five stars. The room (we stayed in a middle-range one) was large by normal standards, well decorated, with an incredibly comfortable huge bed and a well-stocked bathroom. All the service we received was exemplary and the food and drink were good quality without being too crazily priced for a high-end hotel (buffet breakfast is not included in the room price but is US$12 and actually worked out slightly cheaper than eating the same at a local cafe). So we were pretty impressed - until we got our bill which revealed a number of underhand tactics. Firstly, the exchange rate offered is extremely poor even by hotel standards (we were given 11 pesos/dollar when the official rate was 10.2) So if you want to pay your bill by credit card or in pesos cash you end up paying nearly 10% more. The only way of avoiding this is if you pay in US$ cash - but as the rooms are about US$200 you're looking at a carrying a pretty hefty amount of cash around. Not a particularly pleasant prospect in Mexico City (in the end we never felt threatened but had been given loads of warnings about robbery etc before we arrived and hence avoided big wads of cash). Secondly - there are a load of things left out in the bathroom like an Evian atomiser spray and bottled water alongside the sewing kits/shower caps etc. A nice touch we thought, until at check-out we realised the sprays were US$10 each and the water was also chargeable (incidentally, we did check the minibar menu and checked for price tags on all of the items and there was no indication they were not complimentary). And finally, we asked reception to book a tour to Teotihuacan for us as we realised it was going to be tricky getting up there independently. We were given a price, but when we got the bill we found they had charged us a percentage commission on top of the price agreed. This was not mentioned when we booked it, and seemed like a rather odd practice - surely it should be the tour company paying the hotel commission for getting them custom, not the customer?Anyway, to cut a long story short we raised all of this with the manager when we got the bill and he basically said many guests had complained about the underhand charges, admitted it was 'unclear' the items were not free, but despite this would not budge on removing any of them from the bill. So a pretty unsatisfactory outcome.Overall I would recommend anyone staying at Habita to try and enjoy their stay but be aware they are likely to get stiffed financially.

<Content>Very nice The service  care I received was amazing. The Hotel is very trendy and has a boutique hotel feel to it. I loved coming into my room and having music play in the room speakers. The hotel is located in Polanco which is a very nice  upscale neighborhood in Mexico City. Breakfast in the morning was very good, fruits were fresh  the ambiance was nice. This was included in our room rate!I recommend this hotel to anybody that wants to stay in a non resort like hotel  in walking distance to the many luxury shops in the area.

<Content>Nice "cool" hotel We stayed 2 nights at the habita in Mexico City. We booked through Expedia a Queen size bedroom. But as this room was really small and there was no view at all (wall 隆隆), we asked for another room. They changed us to a king size bedroom without additional charge an no problems at all. This room was bigger and the bed was really good.The first problem was breakfast. Expedia mentioned that it was included, but the hotel did not know about that and didn't want to discuss the matter.The service at breakfast was slow and not friendly at all.The second problem was checking out. Our bill had additional charges from the minibar though we didn't have anything. They explained that the botteled water had a cost. After 3 weeks travelling Mexico and stayed in 5 star hotels we were really astonished to hear that. There were other charges on our bill we couldn't explain ourselves were they came from. They cancelled one charge but we found tips we never signed for. Though we speak spanish quite fluently, we gave up trying to get an explanation for the charges. So do check your bill!!We really would like to thank RAMON. He was very friendly and helpful with our luggage. Would be great if all the staff was like him.We would stay there again. We told the hotel about the bill problems and friendliness of the staff and hope, that they will improve their services in the future!

<Content>I'll Give It One More Night I'm writing from the Habita right now. Just changed rooms, which was a hassle, but I hope worth it. Was on the fourth floor last night and couldn't sleep until 2:00 am when the rooftop club shut down and the music and loud talk stopped. The staff was very nice and hospitable about changing, so we'll see what tonight brings. It's been very chilly in Mexico City and I had to ask for an extra blanket ... first they said, No hay but eventually I got a portable electric heater and a blanket. Although I'm a graphic designer, the decor is a bit too minimalist even for my taste. I could use a larger closet, and bathroom fittings and light switches that are easier to figure out. The location couldn't be better, though, especially for a woman travelling alone... who likes to shop.

<Content>Fantastic stay!! We rated the best during our Mexico trip My husband and I stayed at the Habita for 3 nights and could find no faults in the hotel's location, facilities or service. First, the location: it's located in the posh Polanco area, just a block away from the Polanco subway station. For over-crowded, over-polluted Mexico City, this neighborhood is like an oasis calm in the middle of a huge bazaar. The streets around the hotel are perfectly safe with plenty of shopping and dining options. (We recommend nearby D.O. for a superb Spanish dinner)Facilities: We booked a deluxe corner room. The room itself was clean and well-equipped. My husband particularly liked the in-ceiling stereo system, while I was a fan of the huge shower that doubled up as a steam room. The hotel is wired with free wifi throughout (which we had to pay at the Puerto Vallarta Westin). Terry slippers and bathrobes were provided. The bed was super comfortable as was a wooden chair. Take note though that the decor is absolutely minimalist -- an aesthetic that pleases some but not all.We took a swim the first morning at around 730am. Thinking we would have to plunge into an outdoor pool where the water was cooled overnight, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel heats the pool in the morning. Although the pool and the gym are small, that's well-justified given the number of rooms in the hotel. We hardly saw anyone else at the gym or pool. The sauna was ok. Not hot enough. One needs to call the reception ahead of time to heat it up.Service: Service was friendly and intimate. The receptionist, doorman, and concierge quickly recognized us. We were particularly impressed with the efficiency of the concierge. When we expressed an interest at 9pm for a private tour the next day, the concierge quickly had it arranged. Of course, it is a smaller boutique hotel, so the style of service is not the same as at ritz-carlton. For example, the concierge doubled-up as the bellboy to carry our luggage. We thought that was cool and more personal, but some may find it odd or awkwardOverall, we were extremely happy with our stay at the Habita and would definitely recommend to our friends

<Content>Funky but great service The Habita is in many ways a typical designer hotel - the facade has a largely opaque glass exterior with steel trims. The small yet adequate lobby has exposed (but painted) concrete ceilings with the Aura restaurant (serves all 3 meals and is open almost all the time) abutting the passageway leading to the front desk. The room itself (I stayed in room 19) is compact with an open area to relieve any build up of claustrophobia. The bed is comfortable but just about adequate for a couple. WiFi service is great in the room but the lack of dressers leaves no room to unpack clothes besides some hanging space. Despite all the high-end designing, functionality is far from perfect as the closet door could not be opened until the bathroom door was open. The hotel also provides only one bathrobe per room despite double occupancy - so ask for one if you are traveling as a couple.The roof top bar has spectacular views and a (too?) lively crowd particularly on Saturday evenings. The swimming pool looks great but is less welcoming to actual swimmers as there is just about one lane for swimming. The gym has one each of a treadmill, a cycle and a elliptical trainer - barely adequate even for a small hotel. There is also a business center with two computers next to the gym which is open 24/7.Food and service in the Aura restaurant is simply outstanding and a table by the window overlooking ave Presidente Masaryk - the street on which the hotel is located - is well worth the very reasonable prices on the menu. The hotel's location in the very fashionable Polanco district of Mexico City is second to none. Overall a great hotel, particularly for travelers looking to avoid the large crowds in major hotels.

<Content>Great location, fair hotel If you like trendy hotels, or hotels designed by famous architects, the Habita hotel may be for you.The location, on the most important street in the fancy Polanco district, is excelent. The rooms are too minimalistic for my taste. I would add closet space for guest's cloths for example.Staff was pleasent and helpful. Food was good. The roof lounge was very nice and hip. The gym has 3 cardio machines, about average for a hotel this size.The a/c was broken during my stay and never got fixed.. I stayed durign 3 days during an unseasonable warm winter ( 80F during the day) and the room got to warm. Fortunetly you can open you balcony door without loosing to much privacy.

<Content>Minimalist decor---minimal service This hotel has been touted as something special. I did encounter something special during my stay---street noise and sewer gases! I was given a small room on second floor which at first appeared to be within a normal comfort zone though it was a bit worn. However, the next morning I was awoken before six am to the sounds of street noise below.Staff agreed to move to third floor. Might have been happy there until the second day when my bathroom filed with sewer odors eminating from the floor drain. I quickly learned the word for smelly in spanish (hold your nose and the maid gave me a huge can of air freshener. That worked until she retrieved the can next day.) Management ignored my complaints on Tuesday of the week. So every night I covered the drain with a towel and waste basket. Every day the maid removed the cover and neatened the room. The neighborhood was safe but the staff of Habita are in dire need of some customer service training. I received blank stares or some mild mummers of concern when I reported the problem with my room.And then there was my colleague who had the water cut off in the morning while she was out on a run through Polanco. At least she didn't have to deal with sewer gas!

<Content>Know what you are getting We spent 4 nights in the Habita. I love the hotel design, the books in each room, the rooftop pool with gym, jacuzzi and sauna. The minimalist aesthetic is what I like and the beds are really comfortable. But remember this hotel has a lot of drawbacks: The plumbing has all sorts of problems from drain smell, to a pump that jumps and whirs all night if you are unlucky to have it next to your suite. Plugs don麓t work, dryers are missing and they promise to bring one and forget...whilst we were there they were changing the carpets, one day it meant banging and drilling all day and next day they moved us to another room without even telling us while we were away. The rooftop bar means noise, and as New Year麓s Eve was the next day we really felt we were in the way as they were moving furniture and totally concentrating on that bash. The breakfast was heavenly and some of the staff friendly.Street noise is very noticeable. Many fixtures are failing. This hotel is not worthy of one of the Leading Small Hotels of the World status. It needs to decide which customers it wants to cater to and concentrate on looking after them.

<Content>Good but not for everyone The reviews of this hotel seem to be extreme on the positive and negative side. I can see why. This hotel is not for everyone. I recommend it for young(ish) clientele who appreciates minimalist chic. The rooms are so minimalist that they border on barebones. I did enjoy my stay. Positives: great area of town with proximity to shopping and restaurants, great bathrooms with Hermes bath stuff, comfortable beds with premium sheets, access to AREA (the club upstairs). I didn't find it noisy. Downsides: gym and pool are nothing to write home about even though they have rooftop views. Young staff seems to be always a little distracted. The hotel cars are expensive yet old and uncomfortable. The verdict: a great hotel for a shopping/party city break or for passing thru town. Best for yuppies and the design crowd.

Great service and staff. $165 USD/night (corporate rate). Internet access from the room (wired) and from the lounge (wireless). Great place to stay on business travel as restaurants are all within walking distance -- and very safe.One drawback is that it is quite noisy from the street and the nightclub on the roof.Recommended.

<Content>What a great find Just came back from my first visit to Mexico City where I stayed at Habita. The staff at Habita made the biggest difference to my stay!! They were super friendly, made me feel looked after, gave recommendations of where to go and what to do. When I got ill during my stay they really went out of their way to make sure that I was comfortable. The room was an oasis from this chaotic but great city and I will have to go back just to make sure that I enjoy their beautiful roof top bar and pool a bit more. Couldn't have wished for anything better!

<Content>Very good hotel in a safe area We spent four nights in the Habita in July 2004, our first trip to Mexico City.Reading some of the recent postings now, i cannnot believe they really had their accommodation in the Habita.We had a large, spotless cleaned room, the staff was very helpful and friendly. They organized some tours for us with guides who gave us excellent information not only on the sights but also on the living conditions of the locals in DF and mexico in general.Our advantage of course is, that my wife speaks spanish quite fluently and this sometimes opens doors which normally remain shut for other tourists. Teotihuacan, Diego Rivera's murales, Museo Anthropologica, Zccalo, Museo Frida Kahlo are worth to be visited.The Polanco district is safe to walk around even at night, there are many stylish restaurants of high standards and good value for money in walking distance from the hotel. The buffet breakfast in the morning was excellent, we only had once dinner in the hotel, the food was good, but there are better alternatives in the neighborhood. Late at night the hotel terrace is a nice place to chill and to meet locals from DF's High Society.There are not many of these styled hotels in Mexico DF. If you don't like the often uniformed decorated hotel rooms of Hilton, Marriott and other big hotel chains, the Habita is the place to be. The only strange thing that happend during our stay, was a french couple with two kids (about 2-3 y old) who polluted the restaurant during breakfast twice with two giant joints.Nice to start the day with it???On our next trip to DF we will defintely choose the Habita again.Also check the Deseo Hotel in Playa del Carmen/Cancun under the same management.

<Content>Worst service, thievery  I recently stayed at Habita Hotel in Mexico. Despite the high prices and faded accomadations, the staff treated us horribly. When problems arose, the general manager refused to return our calls and the staff continued to cover up for each other's many lies. There are many, many better options now in Mexico City (perhaps Habita was once good but its time has long passed.) I suggest the Four Seasons, La Casona or even the W hotel. You can't possibly do worse than Habita no matter where you try.Avoid at all costs.

<Content>Habita is the best hotel in Mexico City!!!!! Wow! I usually stay at Hotel Nikko when I travel to Mexico City. Habita was recommended to me recently, so I spent four nights there.What a great hotel. First off, let me tell you about the food. My gosh - don't eat out...hang out in the room and order the best room service ever! It's lightning fast, and the quality is beyond five star. Their tortilla soup is the best soup I have ever eaten. Also try the shrimp tacos (much more complex and out of the world-kind of fusion-like than they sound. Their guacamole and homemade chips are superb. I ate so much each night (after full days of meetings) that I couldn't move.The business center has free high-speed internet and a great printer.The health club has machines in very good repair, and you can work out while looking at the very unique pool.The location is very busy - expect some noise from the street.The rooms are a very good size. The honor bar is very well-stocked and the rooms have a lovely bowl of fresh limes (very handy when the aforementioned soup arrives).I'm hooked on Habita. Oh, forgot to mention, by Mexico City standards, it's sooooper cheap for a hotel this nice.Enjoy your soup.

<Content>It's where the beautiful people congregate! Sitting in the Lobby/Bar/Restaurant of this small design hotel is a great place to see and be seen. The soft white lights bounce off the reflective steel accents everywhere and everyone seems to glow, including the manager behind the who went out of his way to assure luxury treatment. A great place for Americans to feel comfortable...most of the staff spoke english and the room service food is familiar, with a Mexican flair. The shopping district is within a short walking distance and appears to be very secure. As promised to the hotel manager, Kurt, I will be beack very soon.

Apart from poor service, smelly bathrooms, noisy private parties until late on the terrace, the fact you could hear pounding from the gym all day in the bedrooms, reception staff who (deliberately or not???) gave incorrect change of dollars to pesos, the final insult was having left a copy of my visa card at reception as security a hotel staff member copied it and has spent (so far!)

<Content>Horrible Lured by favorable reviews I recently reserved a room at Habita. After our arrival my wife and I only remain in the hotel 10 minutes, the time to pay the bill for one night and the transfert , much to expensive for what it is , and run away from this horrible place. The small diminutive intrance was smelling food like a cheap noodles shop, the reception was unfriendly and unprofessional, the room was small , noisy and unconfortable for somebody travelling with three pieces of luggage. I believe they wish to sell the place as design hotel but I would better defined it an hotel of poor design.

<Content>Heaven on Earth Right Here... I thought I died and went to heaven. The Service is beyond compare. As soon as your wet, they make you dry, when your ready to eat, they serve you only the best. The Pool bows down to you and eases you into a sublime swim. The unique touches, such as the movies run accross from the Cantina and the terrycloth lounge chairs create a illusion of paradise, in Mexico City. I could have a spa experience next to the pool or in my own private oasis. This trip melted away all my tension and left me mellow and relaxed to dream of my next visit. I reccomend this Resort, I have traveled extensively and this by far was the icing on the cake!

<Content>Loved the Habita What a wonderful Hotel! I stayed at the Habita for a couple of weeks while in Mexico City for business, and I had the most wonderful experience. I was staying at the Nikko, but truth be told, the beds are way too hard for me there. Speaking of beds, I don't think I've ever slept in such comfortable beds as those at the Habita. The comforter, the sheets, the pillows, everything was wonderful. There is overhead progressive music playing, which really adds to the minimalist art-nouveau ambiance. The cafe downstairs is very good, especially for breakfast. If it's nightlife your looking for, go no further than the upstairs loft area. All the pretty people in Ciudad de Mexico, D.F. gather here during the night for socializing. No doubt about it, when I go back, I'm staying here!
