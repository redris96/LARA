<Content>Nice hotel but it was very loud This hotel has a very upscale feel and the bar area and my room were quite nice. My biggest issue with my stay was that my room was located at the foot of some stairs just outside of the main lobby. As a result it was hard to get to sleep and I ended up being woken up early in the morning. You'll hear people walking up and down the steps and dealing with the front desk staff. If it's possible I would try and ask where your room is and if it's near the stairs or on the lowest floor then I'd recommend you book at another hotel. If you can get a room in a better location then I'm sure you'll have a better stay. The location is a bit of a walk from the train station and from the main museums but if you're in good shape it shouldn't be an issue. If you have problems walking then you'll want to look elsewhere. It's in a nice neighborhood next to a large park and I felt very safe there. If you can verify where your room will be then I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Pretty Good...the Pros and Cons Overall, a very good hotel for the price. Pros:+ Very convenient location - so many things within walking distance!+ As a single woman, I felt it was a fairly safe location. + Clean rooms+ Friendly, helpful and very efficient staff+ Very good breakfast, lovely breakfast room+ Computers with fast and free internet access in the lobby for guestsCons:- Very dim lighting in rooms and lobby- My bed was extremely soft. Back-ache!- View of the room was directly into windows accross..no privacy.- Hard to use the safe they have provided. But there is one!Helpful to know if you've decided to stay there: * Key card for door works like bar code - you scan it * As you enter your room, you must slide your key card into a slot inside near the door - it allows you to turn the lights on and off. * Hot/cold on the shower faucet was not obvious! Take a really good look at the snowflakes carved into the handle. One is larger than the other...that's your clue.

<Content>Disappointed I used Trip Advisor in May when going to Barcelona and consequently loved the Hotel Monte Carlo on Las Ramblas. I was therefore confident that the Hotel Piet Hein would provide the same experience. I booked what was described as a 'deluxe' room but was disappointed on arrival to be shown to a very small basic room that had not been refurbished for four years and was therefore nothing like the stylish images of the hotel shown on the website. I looked out of the very small window onto the side of a building and could see into an adjacent window. My son was very disappointed and I asked the receptionist if we indeed had a 'deluxe' room. She said 'What is deluxe?' Well, I appreciate 'deluxe' could be a matter of interpretation but that room did not even come near. We were, however, shown to a different room which was more in line with our expectations. Apart from this, our stay was very enjoyable. The hotel indeed has a lovely bar area and a very helpful barman. The restaurant was lovely, the breakfast good and the service in the restaurant was superb. In particular, Diana made our stay memorable. The location was great, we loved the area and felt very safe. I would recommend this hotel; just make sure you are clear about the type of room you are getting.

<Content>wonderful stay The hotel is clean and modern. Beds are comfortable. Bathrooms are very clean. Rooms are small but two people can move around. Breakfast room is lovely and the food is standard but very good. A rice table restaurant and a bakery are just around the corner. Van Gogh and Rijick will only be a 5 or 10 min walk. You can buy the tickets at the desk. Also, you can buy the tram strips at the desk. Vondel Park is just in front of the hotel. If it rains they provide umbrellas. Mike's Bike Tours are in front of the Rijick Museum at 1100 everyday. We took the countryside tour for 22 euro and it was fun and easy. Marteen , the bartender, is the best ever. William on the night desk was very welcoming. All the staff are helpful and friendly. The Blue AmsterdamCanalboat Tour is outside the door to the right. When returning to Amsterdam this is the only place I would stay.

<Content>Wonderful and stylish. What a great hotel! Very clean and the staff was very nice. The lobby is very modern and stylish. They have 4 free computers to use in the lobby which is great to quickly check the weather or email from home. The breakfast is really yummy-they bake fresh croissants that are to die for. The room is small-but it was fine for our needs. The bed was comfy and tub was deep. The room was super quiet and we never were disturbed by noise. The hotel runs along the side of Vondelpark, so the street is also pretty quiet.

<Content>Wonderful place After much research, we decided to stay at this hotel. We loved it. It is small, but clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are quiet. Walking distance to everything - the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum (closed, but one part is open), Vondel Park, we even walked to the Anne Frank house, which everyone said was very far, but it was an easy walk. The room was clean, the bathroom clean, everything worked very well. A couple of blocks away is an amazing shopping street - Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and every designer you can think of. The hotel has free internet, a small lobby and bar, but the ambiance is relaxing and the surroundings are beautiful. Highly recommended.

<Content>Excellent Hotel - Great Location My teenage daughter and I stayed at Hotel Piet Hein for 2 nights in July 2008. Our room was excellent: clean, plenty of room, wonderful bedding, big bay window with view of the park... Only problem was the 4-inch step leading into the bathroom! VERY DANGEROUS!! I did fall once, and thank goodness did not get hurt. That aside, everything was wonderful. EXCELLENT breakfast!! GREAT location - we could have walked everywhere, but we took the Canal Bus (fun and informative) to explore the city. We had a delicious Indonesian dinner at the Orient (right around the corner). We were able to take an airport bus to the airport (it made regular stops at the hostel next door) for 8 euros!

<Content>Wonderful stay at this hotel My husband and I spent four nights here in July. We highly recommend this hotel to others who are looking for a moderate-priced hotel in Amsterdam. It is a short walk to the Van Gogh, the Rijksmuseum, Leidseplein, and the #5 tram. The rooms are clean and comfortable, a good breakfast buffet is included, Internet is free, and the ladies at the front desk are helpful and friendly.

<Content>Great hotel, lovely staff My boyfriend and I stayed in the Piet Hein in February 2008 for a long weekend. We loved the Piet Hein - the room was gorgeous. It was big, the bed was huge and very comfortable, we had a great flat screen TV. The bathroom was great, and everything was spotlessly clean. The breakfast was lovely, plenty of variety, great quality. The reception staff were very nice - they provided us with a map when we checked in, and marked the hotel location on it as well as some directions for us to get to various locations we might want to see. We later asked for restaurant recommendations, and we ended up in a fantastic place - I'm afraid I can't remember what it was called, but it was an excellent choice. They also helped us with the metro. The barman was also great, very friendly and chatty. There was free internet access in the lobby area.On our last night, we were a little worse for wear (too much dutch beer!) and I had a terrible hangover the next morning. I called down to the reception and they let us check out a couple of hours late at no extra cost - which was very helpful. All in all, I loved the hotel, the staff were brilliant and I would absolutely stay there again if I went back to Amsterdam. As with most places, they really do love it if you make the effor to speak a bit of their language, even though everyone speaks English extremely well. Ask how to say please and thank you in Dutch - they were very patient with me when I kept repeating it back to check I had it right, and kept getting it wrong anyway. :)

<Content>Good value  helpful staff but very basic rooms Piet Hein Hotel is located next to several museums in Amsterdam (including Van Gogh and Rijkmuseum); and an easy tram ride from the central Dam Square (or a 30-minute walk). The location and staff are very good. The hotel has free wireless Internet (although it was slow or broken at times). The rooms are very small, and basic, but clean. Normally, you don't need air conditioning in Amsterdam, but open window can be noisy.It's a good value, however, and I would stay there again.

<Content>This is not a trendy designhotel! Booked this hotel because the website looked very well. But in fact the hotel was too bad. The room was small en very sober with a tiny window facing a wall. Breakfast was nothing special. The hotel is claiming to be a trendy design hotel, but there is nothing trendy in the hotel! Especially the rooms are far from that. It is very overrated I think. The only good thing is the location: opposite Vondelpark in a very good, central neighbourhood.

Good location, close enough to action yet reasonably quiet and my single room was very adequate with good design and nice bathroom. At 90euros per night it was the upper end of my budjet however I cant complain given I got it on2weeks notice when everywhere else was fully booked.Receptionist was a bit chilly and some of the internet computers did not work but all in all a pleasant stay.

<Content>Disappointed Impressed by Tripadvisor reviews I decided for this hotel and made reservation for twin superior room. The room we got was not twin, but we were adviced by recepitionist to put beds apart by ourselves. Well, it was no spare place to move beds as the room was very very small attic room. Window was very small as well. Acctually there was wall of another building in front of window and smoke from chimney was comming into the room if window was open. Furniture was poor and we had impression of very cheap hotel, but the price was not so low as the quality. One of probles was also noise, if somebody went to the bathroom in neighbouring room it was like he would been in our room. We were very disappointed.

<Content>Nice Location Although the hotel is a 10 min tram trip to the old centre, its in a really nice location just by the park and behind a very posh shopping street. We didnt mind having to jump on the tram but you will need to use a cab if your staying out late as the trams stop and I dont think you could walk it back easily.I think we were given one of the worse rooms as we did get a good deal on the hotel. It was very small and basic but the bed was comfy and if your not planning to stay in your room other than to sleep its all you really need.The downstairs of the hotel is really nice and Im sure from what others have said that there are some good rooms.Overall, good location and good value for money compared to other places we looked at. However its pretty basic and if you want to be in the centre of it all its probably not for you.

<Content>Fantastic... Book now!!! I honestly cannot say enough good things about this hotel. When I booked my room, I requested a room with a view overlooking the street. I was quite impressed that despite the hotel being very busy when I was there, they did meet my request. I arrived early for check-in by about about 40 mins and they informed me that my room wasn't ready yet. They offered me a drink (free of charge), and after a 5 or 10 minute wait, the room was ready.The room itself, was lovely, very clean and comfortable. Very modern, and with a flatscreen tv on the wall above my bed. The view from the window as I mentioned earlier was overlooking the street and the adjacent Vondelpark. Could hear a wee bit of noise but nothing that kept me awake. The staff were very friendly and were able to recommend some good restaurants nearby. The location was a little bit out but only about a five minute walk from the Leidseplein where there were many cafes, bars etc and most importantly a tram stop!

<Content>Pretty Good If you're in Amsterdam for a couple of days and want a GREAT location and don't mind a small room, this is the place. It is two blocks from the Rjiksmuseum and Van Gogh museum. I walked all over the city from the hotel. The staff are very helpful, particularly Martina.The breakfast is so so. Also the hotel is located near the PC shops. If you go there, go to the PC Cafe. I'm still thinking about the sandwich I had.The rooms are SMALL!! But the bed was comfortable and it kept me out of my room since I was there to see the city anyway not lay in the lap of luxury. The free internet is also a nice feature.

<Content>More than a 3 star in many ways The Piet Hein is a hotel I would certainly like to stay at again. It is a very modern-style boutique hotel, very well presented, and reasonably priced. They bill themselves as a 3 star. In a sense they are because it is relatively basic in facilities (such as no minibars), yet the overall impression is of a higher caliber. Call it a 3.5 star.My first night, I was on the top floor back, which is very quiet, overlooking a commons and the back of other buildings on the block. Personally, I rather like that sort of view. The room was a bit small, but had a nice bathroom and a nice double bed. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the heating system, so I was upgraded to a wonderful front room for my second night. It was larger, with bay windows overlooking Vondelpark. On the downside, the front rooms do get some street noise (cars, trams, buses), but it dies down after midnight. The beds were comfy, not quite as firm as I like, but fine. The rooms are modern, with some nice non-hotel feeling furniture, so in spite of being modern, there is some character to the rooms. There seems to be a nautical theme running through the place. The lobby is attractive, has a bar, a sitting area, and free internet access. If you are a business traveler without heavy demands, you will like this place. In fact, a lot of business travelers seem to stay there. I didn't try the breakfast, but it appeared to be a standard simple cold breakfast selection of bread, cereal, fruit cocktail, cheese, meats, hard boiled eggs, etc. Freshly toasted cheese and meat sandwiches were offered, though.I can't say enough good things about the staff. Anything I needed or wanted to know, they were on it. My only negative comments have to do with the bathrooms. The toilet paper dispenser, in my room anyway, was a bit of a reach, and the control fixtures in the shower were counter-intuitive. Being modern, it took me a few minutes to get the hang of them. One knob is for water flow, the other is for temperature mix. But now I'm prepared for the next time I stay there :-).The Piet Hein is in a great location, 10 minutes or less walk from Leidseplein, the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and high-street shopping. So you are close to everything, or can take a tram or taxi if you need to go farther, like the Central Station. I also want to recommend a really great Thai restaurant not too far away at Leidseplein. Its the Royal Thai at Lange Leidsewarsstraat 94.

<Content>Nice little hotel This cute little hotel is in a quiet location. Unfortunately, the renovations are not yet complete and the noise from construction was a bit disruptive. Fortunately, we had no issues with smoke odors in our room (3rd floor). The beds are very comfy. The rooms are not large, but tastefully decorated. The location is great for people who want to visit the museums. There are many shops within walking distance and (if you're in average shape) you can basically walk anywhere in the city within a half hour. Bring a good map because it's easy to get lost. The staff were pleasant and spoke English well. The cold breakfast buffet is perfectly edible. I would stay here again, provided the construction is over  done with.

<Content>Good tourist base, not for asthmatics This small hotel is located beside the Vondelpark in Amsterdam - we stayed in two rooms with three guests for four nights. The location of this hotel is its prime selling factor, it is minutes away from the Van Gogh museum, a five minute walk to the trolleys and canal boats. It is a quiet street away from the bustling of the city centre, so not in the heart of the nightlife but still in good walking distance to many attractions. The rooms were simply decorated in a nautical theme, small as one would expect in Amsterdam, but fine. The toilets were clean and fresh towels provided daily. My main complaint with this hotel was the smell of smoke was everywhere, there was no such thing as non-smoking rooms, the rooms were not airtight and it was a bit oppressive. The lobby stank of smoke as the bar opened right onto the main sitting area, and this smell floated up the hall to the upper floors. I know that not all hotels in Amsterdam provide for the non-smoker but this place was a bit much and sadly would prevent us going back - although it is very nicely located and for the price the rooms are nice. If you don't spend much time in the hotel, as we didn't, it might be ok, or if you are a smoker you will love it!

<Content>LaiYee I stayed in Piet Hein during 3 nights and it was a pleasant stay. The room was small, but for an Amsterdam room it was big!!!! My room had a view of the garden, and Air conditioned. This hotel doesn麓t have the Amsterdam typical stairs. The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was very nice. The location was great, walking distance from the Museumplein and the heart of Amsterdam. If you don麓t like to walk, trams are near (exit from the hotel, turn to the left, turn to the left again, walk for 1-2 min. and you麓ll find the tram stop on the 2nd road on the left . The trams are very fast, in a few minutes you麓ll be in the center (tram 2 or 5 go to the central station). The hotel doesn麓t have restaurant or minibar in the room but you can go to the supermarket (Albert Heijn) in the Museumplein. Take a boatcruise in The Blue Boat Cruises (near Leidsplein), it takes 75 min., it麓s nice to see Amsterdam from the canals. Next time I'm in Amsterdam I will be staying here for sure.

<Content>Can't Wait to Go Back I really enjoyed my stay at Hotel Piet Hein. The staff was very nice and the location was great, just a few blocks from the Van Gogh Museum and the heart of Amsterdam. Yes, the rooms are small but very nicely done. I had a very nice room over looking the garden, and had a room with A/C (which I really didn't need because it was cold while I was there). While they were doing renovations during my stay, it did not cause any inconvenience to me. Truly a very nice place to stay. Also, I thought very reasonably price.

<Content>Average Accomodation but very bad service We stayed at the Piet Hein this spring and I can confirm that the service was bad. We decided that we would be taking de luxe rooms, because the standard rooms were too small. The room was OK, and quiet ( a luxus these days, it seems !). Our room was on the -1 floor, and we had very nice view on a little inside garden.The Dutch Breakfast was OK, but the staff lacked friendliness. The reason why we WILL NOT RETURN TO PIET HEIN ( and therefore DO NOT RECOMMAND IT) is the following : A young receptionnist booked us a tour to the famous Dutch Mills and told us to show up the next day at 13.15 in front of the hotel. So we did and discovered that he had booked us instead on the morning tour and that we couldn't go in the afternoon. The receptionnist that attended us that day - a young lady- told us that she was sorry.- She arranged for us to go in the afternoon anyway and since we were running out of time, she offered to pay us the taxi ... but she said, the taxi fee will be deducted from the receptionist salary.- Since I worked in the hotel business and knew how little people make, we said it would be OK to take the tram ( it was only 10-15 mn away). She thanked us and say that she WOULD MAKE IT UP TO US.... When we returned that day, the young receptionist was there again, he purposely turned his back on us, pretended to be busy, and NEVER TALKED TO US AGAIN. When we checked out, I told the story and asked what THEY COULD DO TO MAKE IT UP TO US...We asked several times, AND THEY SAID THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT... A little effort on their part would have greatly been appreciated... but nobody seemed to care ... So, PIET HEIN ? Thanks, but NO THANKS!

<Content>Timing  This was our 3rd trip to Amsterdam in the last 5 years and was definitely our worst accomodation. The hotel had some wonderful assets like new bathrooms, nice Dutch breakfast and an attempt at chic, but the negatives far outweighed the positives. We were treated with total indifference and a slight abruptness at check-in. We were used to a very pleasant welcome on previous visits at other hotels in Amsterdam. For the price we were paying 150+ Euros/night per room we were disappointed to be in a room that had workmen building a scaffolding inches from our room's only window on the 2nd floor below ground level (-2). From 7:15- 5:30 the workers were singing, banging, clanging, and shouting. Also the sidewalk and road were blocked daily by the construction work. Apparently the PH is annexing the neighboring building. We had 2 rooms on the same floor and in the second room you could not hear the construction clatter. The room we had was either 200 or 210 ans was one to avoid! We will NOT stay there again. There are too many better values and locations to be found next time in Amsterdam.

<Content>Lovely Hotel The Piet Hein hotel located on the Vossiusstraat nearby the PC Hooftstraat and the Van Gogh museum is in my opinion one of the best hotels in Amsterdam.For me this hotel was for a few years a little secret, I kept it for myself! Right now the hotel has become more known and it's many times occupied.The check-in is very pleasant, great staff and friendly service.The rooms vary in space and comfort but are all ok and very clean.The rooms are equipt with a very nice bed and a small workingdesk, the bathroom is small but has a good shower in the bath.Biggest plus is the reasonable pricing, especially when you stay for just 1 night the Piet Hein offers room for like 100 euros.Overall; one of the best places to stay, near musea and Leidseplein, good pricing and comfortable rooms.Keep in mind: except for breakfast; no food available.

<Content>It will now be my hotel whenever I stay in Amsterdam I placed my booking via the hotel website itself, as my friend, who lives in Amsterdam now, suggested it as it was very close to where she and her fiance (now husband) lived. She didn't know too much about it, only that it was nice and quaint and right next to the park and close to Van Gogh Museum, as I was going there for her wedding and to give her a hand in the preparation, I was absolutely ready to put up with whatever as long as it wasn't too expensive, and that it was clean and not too far from everything else. Initial impression over the internet was wonderful, they were friendly and efficient, and got in touch with me very quickly, and took note of any request that I placed and repeated them all back to me in their e-mail of confirmation. I then didn't think about it and got on with life until it was time for me to leave for the airport.It was just as lovely as my friend said and more so, as she had never been in there. I love a fry up breakfast every now and then, though the hotel did not provide that, they provided plenty others, fresh produce, fruits, cereals, breads, eggs, cold cuts, the whole place from top to bottom was spotless, and I never saw a sour face among the staffs, including the chambermaid, who wouldn't take the tips that I left out on the table until I saw her and gave it to her personally.The bar area was small but cosy and big enough for entertainment, on nights when I didn't fancy going out due to the torrential rain, I hung out at the bar with fellow travellers, the bar man was always in good spirit and endlessly amusing and fun. It was all in all such a wonderful experience that I'll recommend it to anyone who'd listen, and I hope to see some of you there and be as charmed by it as I am.

<Content>Charming, Great Value I just returned from a European cruise. Prior to the cruise I stayed three nights at Hotel Piet Hein. My overall experience was excellent. The hotel is charming. Our room was spotlessly clean. It did not have a lot of storage space, but it was enough for a short stay. The bathroom was large and the room had a safe and hair dryer. The hotel is conveniently located to many attractions such as the museums, canal boat tours, Anne Frank's House and shopping which were all within walking distance. The staff was friendly and helpful. The airline lost my luggage . Linda, at the front desk, was extremely helpful in calling often to try to locate my luggage, which was fortunately found prior to my cruise. There is a breakfast room with an ample breakfast. This hotel provided excellent value and service. I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Amsterdam.

<Content>If I had a hammer... I had an enjoyable three night stay at the Hotel Piet Hein from June 11 - 14. I took the train from Schiphol to Central Station and the #5 tram from the station to the hotel. Public transportation in Amsterdam is excellent... user friendly and inexpensive. I arrived at the hotel to be greeted by the sight of scaffolding and the sound of power tools. The hotel is currently in the midst of extensive refurbishment, half of the ground floor is closed and under construction. The reception staff, situated at a table next to the bar, were efficient and professional. I was initially fearful when I was directed to my room in the basement, two floors down. I was traveling alone and expected my single room, (#204), to be small... and it was. The room was an ugly, dark shade of brown but was made much brighter by the very large window/door that opened onto the garden. Wow, what a surpise. I was thrilled to have outdoor space. The garden was lovely and well maintained. I was never bothered by construction noise in my room, (although it was audible during the day), simply closing my window/door blocked it out. I chatted with a couple of guests who were not as lucky. The room was clean and well presented. The twin bed was comfortable. I stocked up on bottled water and a few snacks from the Albert Heijn supermarket just a few blocks away so a refrigerator/mini bar would have been useful but there was none. The room did have a working safe and decent television reception. There is no restaurant in the hotel but breakfast is served and was included in my room rate. I'm embarrassed to admit that I was never up in time to take advantage of that. The lone piece of art on the walls was a sailing print, not bad for hotel decoration.The bathroom was a mixed bag. On the upside: it was clean and modern looking, and there was space to move about. On the downside: the soap and shampoo were one and the same and dispensed from a wall mounted fixture in the shower. Considering that traveling with liquids through airport security is such a hassle these days... it would have been better if there had been basic amenities. The hotel provided a shower cap and a shoe shine clothe. I'd rather had a decent bar of soap and a little bottle of shampoo. It didn't matter, I had the assortment I took from the Stockholm Sheraton. The towels were disappointingly thin and small. I booked this room on Expedia for 拢64 per night. I'm satisfied that I got value for money. The hotel has an excellent location: the tram stop is close, it's only a very short walk to Leidsplein, Vondel Park is right across the street, the major museums are within easy walking distance, and there are plenty of good cafes and resturants nearby. I recommend this hotel, especially if you find a good internet rate, but the construction could be a potentially serious problem. The busy tourist summer months seem an odd time to remodel.

<Content>**Please read- You will thank us...** ***** Please read this if you are travelling soon...*******we stayed at this hotel June 6th until the 10th. A few notes on this hotel.-it is good walking distance to the sights.-it has breakfast included, and rates are reasonable-the morning staff at counter (females) are very nice-breakfast is simple yet nice.also nice breakfast room.*** our downside experiences*** PLEASE READ*****there is construction going on both in the lobby, and ESPECIALLY on the building next door. this started at 7:30 am, so expect to get up early!!, also if you are staying in one of the rooms on the side the scafolding goes up past your window, so unless you want someone climbing into your room, keep your window closed!!!** no air conditioning, and I wouldn't advise to keep your windows open** our veranda was nice, but there were left over booze bottles and cigarettes from previous people, and the tiles don't cover the whole porch and are a tripping hazard, it looked unfinished.** the evening staff are young and useless. we asked for car rental info, they told us they closed at 6pm (both in the area and at the airport-or so we were told) and made no effort to help- I got on the internet and found an Avis ( two min walk away) open until 8pm and found out the airport had car rentals open until 11pm, shoud they not have known this????**** we had our car parked RIGHT OUTSIDE the front doors of the hotel, and went in for 10 minutes to have the front desk check on an address for us, and OUR CAR GOT BROKEN INTO. A side window was broken and our camera and equipment which was in the trunk and out of view were gone. We spent the last day in a police station filling out reports and getting replacement cars.*** My advice -- remember, you get what you pay for. At this hotel they have 1 or 2 staff members on a good day taking care of requests, and most often you have to push to get help with something. I found they were not well informed and felt it was very much like a self service experience. My advise, if you can afford it spend the money on a better hotel, possibly with a doorman that can add extra piece of mind. ( by the way, after they broke into our car, I noticed that there was a hostel on the same street.... go figure.Also, if you are renting a car, get full insurance. our deductable for that little window wa $30 euro. it would have been 200+ without. and parking outside the hotel is 3.60 euro per hour... food for thought.... have a great trip everyone!!!

<Content>average hotel, could improve I would agree with all that has been written in the previous recent reviews. I would like to add a few small grips though. I booked 2 executive single rooms through the hotel web site and requested that if possible could the rooms be on the same floor. At check in we were told that this would not be possible, but the next day one of the staff told me that the hotel was not full. In one of our rooms the safe would not work. The receptionist informed us that this could not be resolved. In the other room the tv remote control was missing and it took 3 visits to reception and 24 hours before one was provided. The carpets were badly stained in both rooms. We did enjoy our stay in the hote however. As the other reviews have stated it is clean and in a good location, a good buffet breakfast is provided and there is free internet in the lobby. Note that while we were there in early May, there were renovation works going on in the hotel, but the noise didn't start until after 9am.

<Content>Excellent Hotel - Ideal Location My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate her birthday last weekend.On arrival we were greated by a helpful man on reception who immediately wished my wife a happy birthday (we had mentioned this on booking). The room we were given was at the rear of the hotel and had a balcony.It was a large room with what appeared to be a newly fitted bathroom suite which had a very nice shower ! The hotel staff had also left a complimentary bottle of wine and card to wish my wife a happy birthday - what a nice touch and I doubt that many other hotels would have done that.There is also a nice relaxing bar area.We felt the breakfast (cereals, fresh fruit, cheese, ham, rolls, eggs,jam and cofee, tea  juices) was very good especially when the deal we had included the breakfast for less than the cost of many 'accommodation only' deals we had looked at.The breakfast room was nice and also appeared to have been recently refurbished.The hotel itself is situated in a nice location - a quiet street right alongside Vondelpark (though this is currently being relandscapped where the hotel is situated). To get to the hotel you need get tram 2 or 5 from centraal station and get off at the Van Gough museum or the stop just before (I cant remember the name of this one though). The Leidesplein is only a 5/10 minute walkaway where there are plenty of bars and restaurants.Pretty much everywhere in Amsterdam is walkable if you are reasonably fit and I feel sure that if you stay at this hotel you will enjoy your stay.

<Content>Great Little Hotel in Wonderful Location Booked this hotel based on the reviews I read here and I was not disappointed!My single room is definitely in the typical european fashion of being about as big as a closet but, everything in it is brand new and very clean. The bed is truly a single bed but the linens are nice with a white duvet (but only one small pillow). The view of the garden is beautiful even in the winter and it is nice to be able to have the window open without it being too noisy. The bathroom is small but has all the standard ammenities. The free wifi internet access in the rooms is also a huge plus.The front desk staff have been very nice and helpful.The location is within walking distance to the mueseums and the tram is very easy to take pretty much anywhere you need to go in the city. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to tourists and business travellers both.

<Content>Good value This is a lovely little hotel in a great location. Good value. Rooms a bit on the small side but then....this is Europe. Staff were a bit clueless when it came to why the computers in the lobby were not printing but other than that, very friendly. The only bad thing is the fact that staff seem to congregate and smoke in the entrance foyer, lobby and bar area and unfortunately, with the staircase being where it is, the smell of smoke permeates the entire building. Our clothes ended up smelling of smoke INSIDE our cupboard in our room and neither of us smoke.... Should give you some idea as to how strong the smell actually was.

Public tranportaion everywhere is in 1-3 minutes walk.It is in a very quiet street (we stayed ther at new year's eve and it was quite).Nice breakfast, the stuff is nice too.As it is smallit gives a familly atmosphere.True - rooms are small, but cleen and comfprtable. If you came to see the city you don't need much more than a goos bed and good bath.I will return happily.

<Content>Well chilled On arrival, thought it looked a bit minimalist, but found it to be a very relaxed stay in a great city. Just outside the Vondelpark - not much use in December but would be great in summer! Very convenient for Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh, Heineken experience; also for Canal bus at Leidseplein. The bar area was comfortable with Internet access available, relaxed but friendly welcome. No restaurant, but there are plenty of all descriptions near Leidseplein, a short walk, or elsewhere, so this wasn't a problem. We had a great Dutch-style meal at Blonde Hollander (Leidskruisstraat), also nice Italian at Canaletto, just round the corner. Looking forward to returning!

<Content>Good location We stayed at the Piet Hein Hotel in December 2006 for four nights. Our room was clean but was very dark even with all the lights on. The carpet is a very dark colour and the walls were a dark mucky brown colour. It was very difficult to see anything on the floor, for example, black socks. There were about three steps up to the bathroom. The bathroom was fine except that the soap/shampoo dispensers were empty the whole time we were there and not filled up. No other freebie toiletries were supplied. Breakfast was nice and the decor of the room was lovely. The breakfast staff were friendly but they kept asking everyone for their room number every five minutes, I think they kept forgetting who they had already asked! The location of this hotel is pretty good for walking into the main part of Amsterdam (the capital is not very big). The majority of the reception staff were very friendly except for the lady who checked us out. She was a bit abrupt and as soon as she'd updated the computer she just left us and went to talk to someone else. I thought it would have been nice for her to have thanked us for staying or to wish us a safe trip back. Overall, would I stay there again? Probably not, but only because I wasn't that impressed with Amsterdam.

<Content>Good Location Hotel was in a great location, very near the important museums and shopping areas.The rooms were very small and simple as was the bathroom. An extra blanket in the room would have been good as there is only fan heating. For travellers like me that sometimes forget, a mini tube of toothpaste would have been helpful. They had none in the hotel when I asked. Also towels were tiny and bathroom floor needed a good clean. No mini bar so if you wanted a drink of water before bed you had to purchase from the bar.The choice of breakfast was very good and the atmosphere in the hotel was very friendly. I would recommend this to a friend.

<Content>Stay Here! The Piet Hein is a wonderful hotel with a very friendly staff (including the bar staff). The rooms were small (like most) but very tidy. The most important element, the bed, was very comfortable with soft comforters. The immaculate washroom had an adjustable shower head with strong water pressure. This comes in handy for people that are tall ( 6'-6 like me). The location is within two blocks of the ELITE shopping district and trams that will take you everywhere. If you're into gambling, the casino is a pleasant 5 minute walk through the park. Speaking of Vondel Park, enjoy a beer or sandwich a Cafe Vertigo. The only shortcomings were:The breakfast is VERY basic (but good) and we could only stand it for two days in a row (Get me some Dutch pancakes).The hotels soap is liquid form and I couldn't use it.Plastic cups in the room. Where's the glasses?

<Content>Decent hotel if your flight is not delayed/cancelled I used Expedia to book my room at Hotel Piet Hein and prepaid the full amount for my 6-night stay. When my flight from Chicago to Amsterdam was delayed for 22 hours due to mechanical failure, I phoned the Hotel Piet Hein to inform them that I would be arriving a day late. Their immediate reaction was to advise me that they could not give me a refund because they were holding the room for me. They said I could take it up with Expedia when I returned to the U.S. Upon arrival at the hotel, the manager came out of her office to apologize for the fact that the room they were supposed to hold for me had been given to someone else the night before due to overbooking by the hotel. Consequently, I couldn鈥檛 check in until the person occupying the room had checked out.When I checked out of the hotel 5 days later, the desk clerk said there was a notation on my account indicating that I owed the hotel for an additional night鈥檚 stay because of my late arrival. She backed down, though, when I explained the circumstances of my late arrival. Upon returning to the U.S. I contacted Expedia to request a refund for my first night鈥檚 hotel accommodation. When Expedia contacted Hotel Piet Hein to inform them of my refund request, the hotel claimed that they had held my room for me the first night and had lost the income that would have resulted from renting out the room. As soon as I provided Expedia with the details of my interactions with hotel staff, Expedia understood what had happened and granted my refund request. I will definitely use Expedia in the future to book hotel reservations!

<Content>Friendly, warm atmosphere Booked the hotel Piet Hein after reading several reviews of lots of other hotels in Amsterdam. We were not disappointed.Only a couple of minute's walk away from the Van Gogh museum and round the corner from the tram stop.The staff were friendly and warm and very welcoming. We booked a superior double and were allocated a room at the rear of the hotel overlooking the garden. Spotlessly clean and very comfortable with excellent bathroom. Only downside was the lack of cupboard space - only one wardrobe and no drawers - but as our stay was only for three nights this was not too inconvenient.Breakfast was typical continental fare - in a pleasantly decorated dining room. A real find! We would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay just outside the hubub of the centre of Amsterdam, but still within easy reach of all attractions.Linda and Tony Hibbert, Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire

<Content>Great location Excellent location. Within 5 mintes of 2 tram lines which run very frequently into the city centre or walk for 10 minutes across the park (entrance right on your doorstep!) to the city canals. We stayed in October and hotel busy but rooms remained very quiet. Rooms are on the small side, but true of most hotels in European capitals! Staff very friendly and helpful. Amsterdam is a very 'smokey' city so expect bars and eating places to be smokey. Non smoking areas seem at a real premium! The hotel bar is certainly smokey most evenings. Would recommend this hotel.

It's in a great (and VERY safe) location with a beautiful park directly in front of the hotel, incredible shopping around the corner and public transportation very close by.The room I was in had two twin beds pushed together and compared to American standards, very small. However, it was immaculate, comfortable and had a great bathroom in the room as well. The staff was very welcoming and helpful, the hotel lobby had internet access (you only pay for the time you use) and though I didn't spend a lot of time here, it was well worth every dollar.

<Content>Excellent Location I chose this hotel based on recommendations on TripAdvisor.com, and was entirely satisfied with my stay. I arrived at 8:30am in the morning from a flight from the US and they had no problem allowing me to check into a room right away. I had reserved a 'Business Single' room on the hotel website, but I think I received an upgraded double room, and was ultimately charged for only the basic single room. The rooms are not large but are very well maintained and spotlessly clean. The location of the hotel is great, literally across the street from the Vondelpark, and just a couple of minutes walk from canals, trams, Leidseplein, museums, etc.Book online through the hotel's website to get free breakfast included (though the breakfast is nothing to write home about).I would definitely stay here again on a visit to Amsterdam.

The hotel was comfortable, bathroom really modern and clean with a great shower, beds really comfortable too and the room spacious. The people who worked there were professional, pleasant and really helpful too. Its tucked away near the park so is very quiet too, but near enough to the centre so you've only got a 5 minute walk in.This must be one of the best value hotels in Amsterdam

<Content>Perfect Location Not having been to Amsterdam before I took a chance on booking my stay in a quiet part of the city. That usually means dull or remote, but nothing could be further from the truth. The Hotel Piet Hein puts you three blocks from the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum, a block from high-end shopping, just across the street from Vondelpark (the city's main park) and just over a canal from the bustling Leidseplein. Plus there's great dining (a bakery, a cafe, a herring stand, a great Indonesian place) right around the corner. We booked a deluxe room (A superior room is just their regular room, BTW. Don't think you're getting anything special in a Superior.) in order to assure ourselves of AC and it was great. A nice queen bed (not two twins pushed together) for my wife and I. Friendly, helpful staff. A really modern but comfortable decor. Good breakfast in the morning. A nice little bar to welcome you back from your day exploring too. Can't imagine how hectic and perhaps intimidating the city would have felt if we had stayed near the Dam or Centraal Station.

We had a wonderful 5-day stay at the Piet Hein - friendly staff, ideal location opposite the Vondelpark, a stone's throw from the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum, within easy walking distance of the centre.The buffet breakfast was delicious, served in a charming basement room.Best of all was our wonderful bedroom (one of the DeLuxe rooms with a Sand bed), with big picture windows giving onto the little courtyard garden. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in! We also obtained a reasonable rate (for Amsterdam!) on the hotel's own website, including breakfast and taxes.I would certainly recommend this delightful hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Nice Hotel I stayed at the Hotel Piet Hein on July 20 through July 23rd and found it to be a very comfortable hotel. The rooms are small (typical of Europe) and some of them don't have air. It was super hot during my stay and I had booked a single room that did not have air. Luckily, there was a larger room available that had air and they allowed me to change rooms for an additional charge for the larger room. I found the staff to be very helpful  friendly and the location was supurb. I used the hotel recommended taxi service to the airport and found it to be very reasonable priced.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Amsterdam.

<Content>A really nice but affordable hotel Was so pleased with my stay at the Piet Hein mid June of 2006. Entire room was very clean and comfortable (I paid a bit more for 'business class' sized single, which was still small by US standards but not too bad). The hotel has internet service in the lobby which you can charge to your room, several international TV stations in your room and A FABULOUS FABULOUS BREAKFAST with toast, salami, cheese, soft boiled eggs, cereal, juice, tea, coffee, yogurt, fruit,... really comprehensive and delicious. When it rained one day and I asked where I could buy an umbrella, the desk clerk gave me one from the hotel to use free of charge. All staff I met spoke English and were very helpful in pointing me in the next direction to go. Hotel is located just steps from the Van Gogh Museum and the Leidesplein. You can take the #5 Tram from the WTC to and from the Airport. Fabulous stay, would do it again.

<Content>Marvelous staff, fantastic location I love the Piet Hein and would never consider staying anywhere else in Amsterdam. It's less than a 5-minute walk from the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum, and very convenient from the train station via tram or on foot (about 25 minutes on foot). There are dozens of restaurants within a 5-minute walk, of every kind imaginable, yet the hotel is across from a park and in a very quiet location. The beds are comfortable, the pillows absolutely divine (I was tempted to try to stuff one into my luggage) and the room was so clean it seemed one could eat off any surface. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. The only thing I didn't love about the hotel is their noisy doors. If you happen to be next door to guests who love the nightlife, be prepared to be awakened at 3 am or so by a slamming door. The hotel's website, and information given out at the train station, indicates that to get to the hotel you should take tram 2 or 5 and get off at Hobbemastraat. But we found if we waited to get off until the next stop (across the street from the Van Gogh Museum), the walk to the hotel is considerably shorter.

<Content>Piet Hein a delightful cocoon! I was initially skeptical of the Piet Hein, since I was a bit shocked by the small dimensions of the basic single room and problems connecting with the hotels toll wifi network. However, after a night of quiet and undisturbed sleep in a delightfully serene room facing the garden, luxuriating under the down comforter and cocooned in a haven of pillows, I was more inclined to appreciate the benefits of this hotel. Book with the hotel website directly for the best deals, particularly since breakfast is included in the room rate, which isn't the case with some consolidators. The breakfast is quite exceptional, expansive and presented in a gracious and comfortable setting. It compares well with similar offerings at 5 star hotels in the city, or even up the road at the Leidseplein! The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and I'll forever be thankful to the woman at reception who clued me into the free internet signal available from the very comfortable lobby. The bar/lobby provides a most amenable space either for socializing with friends pre- and post-urban adventures or for getting things done. Extraordinary bargain for the price!

<Content>Not particularly outstanding . . . . Given the reviews on this site, I expected way more than this distinctly average to below-average 3-star hotel. In fact, when I asked about a simple amenity, the girl at the desk flipped out and cried, We are only a 3-star hotel! We are only 3 stars!The carpets were very dirty, there was a bad smell in the hallways, the bed was uncomfortable, the room was the typical European tiny size, the shower was the usual splash-and-puddle all over the floor, the room was cold and so was the staff. In fact, one of their staff personally told me that they often intentionally left their guests waiting 1-2 hours or longer after their rooms were ready if any remark was made about having to wait at all. This person also told me they enjoyed making those guests wait because there was nowhere to store their luggage in the meantime and their plans would be ruined for hours! I was not surprised so much that this happened but was very surprised at the venom and the glee and the name-calling (generally, stupid idiot guests) . . . . I actually witnessed this occurrence (except for the name-calling) but could not say whether the room was actually unavailable. However, the clerk was not very nice and seemed to enjoy giving the folks the bad news.The location was not terrible but it was a long walk to the main drag. I will probably inquire at the Park Hotel or another the next time I visit Amsterdam. I will not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>among Amsterdam's finest this is the nicest of all my many A-dam experiences:friendly clerks (a rarity in Holland), pretty recent renovations, a garden in the back and a park in the front (for early morning running). They even have wi-fi (12,50 a night) but more often than not, it doesnt work. ask for a room in the new wing and ignore the dunces who work the reception at night but in reality just stand at the bar, get drunk and forget to write down your wake up call.

<Content>Small, but great location Even though I was prepared for a small room, I still was a bit surprised by HOW small it really was, and I had a deluxe. Still, once I dealt with that, I really enjoyed this hotel.The outside of the hotel and the lobby are very stylish. The breakfast room is narrow, but pleasant enough. The room itself was small (as I've said), but the bed was decent, and the TV and other standard elements were sufficient.The location of the hotel is really the best thing - it's an easy walk to Leidesplein, the casino, etc. The hotel is across the street from Vondelspark, so if you have a room that faces that way (I didn't), it's probably a very nice view.I chatted with a couple of the women behind the counter at the hotel, and they were quite friendly, as was the barman. All in all, this is a nice, solid 3 star hotel.

<Content>Will stay here everytime!! A great hotel, located snugly in between the Park, the Museum district and the centre of town. An easy walk to anywhere, and the tram lines are closeby too.Clean, cosy rooms - ours had a view of the park. The bar downstairs is a great place to prepare for an evening out! The staff are very helpful, speak wonderful English and even let us use the internet without charge when checking in for our flight!Considering the low price, we will most certainly be returning to Piet Hein the next time we stay in Amsterdam!

<Content>Good, relatively cheap stay Myself and my wife stayed at the Hotel Piet Hein in February 2006, purely based upon the recommendations on Tripadvisor. We were looking for a relatively cheap, good quality hotel handy for the sights and sounds of Amsterdam. The Hotel Piet Hein did not disappoint.The hotel room itself was small but well formed, with a good quality bathroom and the breakfast provided was of a good quality too. This was not the best hotel we have ever stayed in (the Hotel Rival in Stockholm would fit that bill) but, for the price, the Piet Hein was not a disappointment at all.

<Content>Great value and more... This was my 3rd trip to Amsterdam and 1st to Piet Hein Hotel. Stayed six nights mid January for holiday. Chose PH hotel based on positive reviews and location adjacent to Vondel Park / near Leidseplein. Very clean modern hotel with very friendly staff and agree with other review that Martin(bartender) is great and very helpful. Room and bathroom not large but were very clean and bathroom had shower with plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Breafast buffet nice and was included in our rate (normally about 10 Euro/person). -I booked directly through hotel. We were allowed to check in 0830 and this was appreciated after all night flight. Location is superb -museums, nightlife and restraunts ALL few minutes walk at best. For a 3 star hotel PH did not disappoint.

<Content>Lovely Hotel in a good location My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Piet Hein chosen partly for previous good reviews and partly due to its closeness to the museum area. The room was fine, the breakfast good and we found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The area was very quiet but any action was fairly close. Only negative point was that the room still felt a bit cold despite the air conditioning cranked up. We would still recommend it and will return one day.

<Content>Great Place and Superb Location We have just spent 5 nights at this hotel in Amsterdam. Good for public transport - the 2 and 5 tram takes you straight to Central Station. Great for the Van Gogh and Rikjsmuseum and a short walk into the centre of Amsterdam. The next street has all the designer shores plus a brilliant Italian deli. Vondelpark (adjacent) gives a really interesting snapshot on family life for Amsterdammers - as well as cyclers and joggers. Had a couple of great dinners at the Cafe Americain (5 minutes walk), and Puri Mas (Indonesian) and fab pancackes at Le Soleil (all within walking distance). The staff were very friendly - the guy who runs the bar is good fun and directed us the Joordan district for individual shops where we did all our Christmas shopping. Would definitely visit again.

It is within walking distance of the major museums and streetcars.The staff is very friendly and they gave us good advice on where to visit and where to eat. The hotel serves an excellent buffet breakfast every morning.The only negatives were that our room never got quite warm enough and there were only bottom sheets on the beds - no top sheet to separate you from the bedcover. This hotel is an excellent value and I'd definitely stay there again.Joe

<Content>Very nice hotel, great location We had a very nice 3 night stay at the Piet Hein, and we will stay there again when (hopefully) we return to Amsterdamn. At first the staff was a bit cold to us, actually a little insulting regarding our parking situation. They did warm up after our friendly interaction regarding the one problem with our room. It seems that someone left the hotel in haste and forgot to remove their items from the closet. The staff was extremely apologetic and was grateful that we were understanding. Neither my wife nor I though it was a big deal but they certainly did.The breakfast buffet was nice, we had to pay but I think it was worth the money. The hotel bar was very pleasant, and the back garden area was quite nice. Our room overlooked the garden and was quite and comfortable. One sidenote I will make is NEVER drive into Amsterdam. What a waste of money for parking. If you do drive, bring tons of coins for the parking meters. An evening pass will run you @18 euros, all in coin. We did manage to but a full day pass from the hotel which really helped the other two days (@ 31 euro each day).

<Content>Not What We Expected We read rave reviews about this place and were very disappointed in what we got as a superior double room. Perhaps they were out of the best rooms and we had the bad luck of being assigned room 121. It did have hot water and heat and CNN. Otherwise, room 121 looks directly out at a brick wall (no trace of a green tree or any other foliage ANYWHERE from our room), the walls inside the room were painted dark brown, not a cozy, inviting place. The bathroom was tiny, barely any room to move inside the shower, no bathtub. If you decide to stay here, make sure you ask for a view and stay away from room 121!

<Content>Loved This Place! We really loved the Hotel Piet Hein. The rooms are very small, but very clean. The bathroom looked fairly new too.One thing we didn't like: You could hear people walking up the stairs at various times of the day. Not sure if the walls are thin or what, but it was kind of annoying. However, it wouldn't keep us from staying there again.Also: Our big bed was 2 little beds pushed together with two blankets. No big deal on that though. It was all above average for the price that we paid. Front sitting area and bar area were very nice. People were friendly too. Breakfast was nothing spectacular, but it was included and more than enough to get you started on your day.Great location too: Within walking distance to a lot of attractions as well as public transportation stops. Definitely would recommend this place.

The hotel staff was very helpful in answering all our questions regarding transportation and destinations. The hotel bar was a great place to have a drink at the end of the day. The bartender and front desk clerk provided us with great suggestions for side trips.The location was perfect as we were able to walk to all of the museums and shopping areas. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Smart Hotel, good location The hotel is in both a quiet and central location; 2 steps from the Vondelpark and 2 minutes from Leidersplein. The public areas are smart and modern and the rooms functional, clean but a bit small. We travelled with a baby and though a very clean and comfortable cot was waiting for him in our room, the lack of space and facilities like a kettle made things a bit difficult. The staff were all helpful and friendly and overall I would recommend it as a good city hotel, but perhaps more suited to singles / couples than families.

Most of the reviews we read were favorable, and we were very pleased with our stay here in mid-June of 2005, especially having an air-conditioned room since all of Europe was experiencing a heat wave. The room was small but clean and comfortable, the location excellent, the staff very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellent and served in a very attractive room. We felt that we received excellent value for the price.

<Content>Loved it! We stayed a week at the Piet Hein and loved it. When we arrived, we were given a large room, as I had requested, but it was in the older section of the hotel without air conditioning. Unfortunately, Amsterdam was unusually hot, but the staff kindly moved us to the newer annex to a smaller room that had air conditioning. The location of the hotel on Vondelpark and close to tram stops seems unbeatable. We travelled all over the city with ease and spent lots of time walking in the park. It is a very joyful and active place with happy people having picnics and playing. The staff at the Piet Hein was friendly and we enjoyed the small bar in the lobby area. Martin, the bartender, was especially nice. Amsterdam is a city that accomodates pedestrians and bicyclists, but not motor vehicles. Some construction was going on near the hotel in June 2005 and our taxi driver became quite frustrated getting us to the hotel. He dropped us off a couple of blocks from it and we eventually found it tucked away facing Vondelpark. It was worth the walk.

<Content>Warning of bait-and-switch... My agent booked me into this hotel during a recent business trip to Amsterdam. Upon arriving, my girlfriend was told that there was a mistake and the hotel was overbooked but reassured that a room was reserved for us in Hotel Europa 92 down the street at the same price. Hotel Europa is not a business-class quality hotel, and the staff at Hotel Piet Hein were shockingly rude when I declined to stay there. They asked me to pay for the room because we had taken the key briefly while looking at the room. This ensued in a heated argument until they finally backed down.I am not sure why Hotel Piet Hein would try to pass off a much lesser hotel at the same price. Perhaps it has something to do with the close relationship they claim to have with Hotel Europa. At any rate, just wanted to let other folks know about this potential issue.

<Content>Beware the Annex Booked to stay in another hotel in Amsterdam in May 2003 but got changed at last minute by the internet booking company we used (think they may have gone out of business now as can't find them any more) to the Hotel Piet Hein. When we arrived thought nice hotel, only to discover that we had been booked into the hotel's annex which was a few doors down the same street.Absolute nightmare of a room, up three flights of very steep stairs, room very dirty, ripped curtains, mould in bathroom, stained carpets, etc. Didn't get our own key to the door of the annex but had to ask at main reception for someone to come along and let us in. In short, not somewhere I would reccomend.That said, things may have changed in the Annex as it was a few years ago, but beware when booking, make sure its the main hotel which is really nice.

<Content>Recommended  Have just returned from the Hotel Piet Hein and will definitely be returning. The staff were wonderful, very helpful and friendly. The barman was extremely friendly, made us feel really welcome and even treated us to a local drink. The room was bigger than we expected and was clean and tidy with air conditioning. The staff were only too happy to keep hold of our bags after we checked out so we could explore the city a bit more without luggage until it was time to leave for the airport.The hotel is nicely situated, opposite a beautiful park and around the corner from the Van Gough museum. It is a fair walk to the center (although a pleasant one, if you don't get too lost). You can also take a tram (2 or 5) from outside the Van Gough museum which takes you to the center (1.60 euros... pay the driver or get a 10 trip pass from the supermarket) or alternatively you can get a taxi for about 13 - 16 euros.Only negative thing is the breakfast, very basic and bland... shame because everything is perfect.

Very clean and neat, modern lounge with large screen computers and internet access. Location is fabulous - short walk to museums, Leidseplein and Vondel Park. The more expensive rooms are in a new annex in the back overlooking beautiful garden. Cheaper rooms are in the front older building - slightly less modern and sparkling (no air conditioning), but clean, comfortable and huge windows overlooking beautiful Vondel Park.

<Content>A great find in Amsterdam After searching for an Amsterdam hotel on the web, and seeing what others on Trip Advisor had to say, I chose Hotel Piet Hein for an early June stay and was not disappointed. The location is excellent - across a quiet street from the lovely Vondelpark, around the corner from the Van Gogh Museum  Rijksmuseum, a short tram ride away from anything else we wanted.We booked online ahead of time and got a good deal - $206 CDN a night. I emailed separately to request a child's cot in the room for our toddler but they didn't receive the message. Nevertheless, the front desk instantly upgraded us to a room that could accomodate all three of us, and set up the cot right away with no fuss and plenty of smiles. The room was tastefully decorated, very clean, comfortable and quiet, too. The breakfast was more than we needed.There's a supermarket a few blocks away, a canal cruise company three minutes walk away, and a bike rental place just past that. There's also some very high-end shopping the next street over (as the driver of our airport shuttle said, you'll need a credit card with no limits to shop there).Our travel agent had recommended other hotels in the same price range, but they were all a bit rundown or out of the way. The Hotel Piet Hein is neither, and it made our short visit to Amsterdam very peaceful  comfortable. We highly recommending this hotel.

<Content>Only minor probs - would stay again! Hi, Just got back form Amsterdam. The hotel was lovely right next to a park which was great for evening strolls. The hotel is away from the main centre which meant that is was very quiet and peaceful. The room itself was very clean and a good size the bathroom was spotless and a decent size with a bath and power-shower.The breakfast room with clean and the breakfast was simple but nice they served breakfast until 11am which was good. Also i think we were the youngest people staying at the hotel both my partner and I are 23 years old... but that wasnt a bad thing!!The only problems, which were quite small such as the sheets were too small for the bed (they didnt tuck under the matrass) which meant that during the night the sheets collected in the middle of the bed... atleast the matrass was clean!On the last day we had finished having breakfast at 11am and went up to collect our things to leave and we got a call from the reception asking what time we were leaving and if we would hurry up and leave - which was a bit rude seeing that we were half way out the door anyway!!Also the room next door had a balacony so the people would stand on the balancony and make phone calls very loudly. I would have complained but we were only there for three daysApart from these small problems if we went back to Amsterdam we would definatly go back to this hotel.I hope this helps anyone thinking of booking this hotel, it was a lovely hotel and the doors do have locks on them to stop housekeeping from coming in!!!

<Content>Great hotel Just spent three night at this hotel. We had booked well in advance, and as such were allocated a brilliant room overlooking the park with a terrace. I imangine not all rooms this great, so you may want to ask for it. The location was perfect for our needs, in that we were happy to be a little removed from the complete bustle of the red light district / central station area. This hotel is remarkably close to the Museum district, and has great upscale shopping and non-chain restaurants within a short walk. It is no problem to get downtown by walking or hopping on a tram.Very pleasant and helpful staff. Reccomended!

<Content>A Great Location My father, brother, and I stayed at the Hotel Piet Hein in Amsterdam on May 5 and 6, 2005. This hotel has a very comfortable and modern lounge/bar area in the lobby where you can get snacks and use the internet (for a fee). Most of the staff were exceedingly friendly and helpful, except for one female staff member, but the others made up for her snooty attitude. The hotel has a modern lift. Our rooms were the deluxe twin and double rooms. They were small indeed, however, they were very clean and ultra-modern. The weather during our stay was very cool and damp, and one of the rooms did not have any heat as the air conditioning was already turned on for the season. We had requested rooms on the upper floors but my room was on a floor where my window was at ground level, but at least it had a hot water heater. The duvets were very warm and comfy.We were able to purchase strip-tickets for the tram at the hotel. To reach the tram stop you had to walk about two blocks along the side of Vondel Park. The location was quite good, within walking distance of the Casino, many restaurants (including Pizza Hut), and the canal tours. I recommend this hotel if you don't mind tiny rooms.

<Content>Good value--but a few kinks My wife and I loved this hotel at first--friendly staff, great location, good value. But a few things bothered us. On our first day, the housekeeper walked in while we were in the room. She knocked first, but apparently didn't hear us yell that we were inside. Both nights of our stay, I found it tough to sleep because the trams right outside our window were really loud. Finally, the morning we were to leave, we asked for a wake-up call that never came. The room didn't have an alarm clock so we were depending on it. Fortunately I was awake from the trams, but I would have been really upset if we'd missed our train because they missed the wake-up call.Maybe we just had bad luck...apart from these isolated problems, the hotel was comfortable and pleasant.

The location is very good, quiet, but within walking distanceof the liveier parts of Amsterdam.We didn't part-take of the breakfast (beds too comfy) so cannotcomment on this.The deluxe room we had was kept very clean and, if a little on the small side, was adequate, but only had a very tiny window overlooking the windows of the other rooms. We got a good deal on the price of this hotel but I would have been disappointed with the room if we had paid full price!The rooms also need tea and coffee making facilities.The hotel can be a little noisy with doors slamming and noise from the uncarpeted stairs. Also the maids appeared to start their cleaning very early. Having said this, we would definitely return to Hotel Piet Hein.

<Content>A little Gem of a Hotel Recently returned from a weekend break at the Piet Hein. I'd booked based on the reports here and they were all spot on. This is a little gem of hotel. Very modern boutique style hotel, but small and friendly. The public areas are a real treat for such a small hotel. Some of the rooms are small, our friends had a top floor room with a half size wardrobe under the window!, but that鈥檚 European city centre hotels for you (we actually had a great room with a balcony overlooking the park). The location cannot be faulted. It鈥檚 a short walk from the hotel to all the museums, the canal bus, tram , restaurants and unfortunately the shops. Breakfast was a good and varied continental buffet, but for the last day we decided on a full fat option and went along to the Irish bar at the end of the road. If you want a slightly different meal experience then I would suggest the evening canal cruise with meal. Its about 40quid each, but you get a 2 hour trip, 3 course meal and as much beer or wine as you can drink in the time. Excellent value and the food was surprisingly good, the best we had in fact. Amsterdam is a beautiful city with lots to see and do and the people are really friendly. I was pleasantly surprised

<Content>Good for city break Hotel Piet Hein is conveniently located in the museum quarter of the city, away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre, overlooking the Vondelpark. Travel to the heart of the city is easy, either on foot, tram or canal bus.Hotel was clean, modern and the staff were very welcoming and helpful with advice and information for our excursions, which could be booked from the front desk.We were in a deluxe room in the new wing overlooking the rear courtyard, delightfully landscaped with chairs and tables. Room was well equipped, light airy and modern - pity there were no tea  coffee making facilities in the room.We were on the second floor, but there was noise from doors slamming at night, particularly midnight onwards.Breakfast was a very pleasant, buffet style experience.Thoroughly recommend to anyone.

<Content>Becoming my favorite place to stay.......... I recently stay at Hotel Peit Hien with a friend. It was my second time I stayed here. We were greeted with smiles and welcomes. Even though we arrived early our check-in took about five minutes. As expected our room was clean and neat. We had twin beds this trip. I don't know why but the cover they use on the beds are soft and comfortable. And once your underneath them it's so warm and cozy. Nice clean bathroom with plenty of hot water in the shower. Room service was pretty quick. By the time we returned from our great included breakfast, the room was already made up. The hotel is right above Vondel Park. The park is great for a early morning or late night stroll. I feel this hotel is in a prime location. Your away from the city noise but yet close enough to get from a to b fairly easy by either hoofing it or taking the tram. I'm returning to Piet Hien again in May and I'm thinking about my next year trip as well. Departing took just long enough to place my keys on the counter.

<Content>clean, stylish and a good value We were pleasantly surprised to find the Piet Hein -- a three star -- so well appointed. Furnishings and plumbing were modern and relatively new. The decorating was sleek and stylish. The small lobby and bar area were lively, service was good and the breakfast swell. Beds were comfortable, and the garden area is a delight. We also liked the location in a quiet residential area next to a large park but an easy walk to canals, shops, museums and restaurants. A cab ride from the Central Station cost under $20 and a trip to the airport by taxi was about $35. The only problem at the Piet Hein is noise. From our ground-level room we could hear doors slamming and people tromping up and down the stairs. Some carpeting of the stairways and brakes on the doors could turn this fine inn into a true Dutch treat.

<Content>Treat in Amsterdam I stayed at the Piet Hein with my boyfriend for 2 nights in March based on the user reviews posted on Trip Advisor and wasn't disappointed. This area of Amsterdam is great as it's out of the main hustle and bustle, near the museums and close enough to be able to hop on a tram and be in the heart of the action. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful and the place was clean as were the rooms - nice white linen and a bright, clean, modern bathroom. The hotel is also located right next to Vondel Park, great for strolling around and watching the locals run, jog and walk their dogs (sometimes at the same time!).I would definately go back here when next visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Great Hotel What a wonderful hotel!We arrived at midnight on a snowy evening in March, having been delayed for five hours on our journey, to find a friendly, comfortable warm and inviting hotel.First impressions were of a stylish reception/lounge/bar area. Wooden floors, subtle decor in cream, white and a sort of grey/khaki colour. Leather sofas, a raised bar (open until 1.00am, a blissful discovery for two thirsty travellers who arrived at midnight!) area and extra decoration provided by the displays of white tulips dotted around the place. Sublime!The room itself was small but, like the rest of the hotel, simply and stylishly decorated. The bed was incredibly comfortable with just the sort of softness you wanted to ease weary feet and legs after strolling round the city. Breakfast is continental 鈥?breads, cheeses, meat, eggs, cereals 鈥?but very tasty and served in an attractive breakfast room just slightly below street level. Sit in the window and you can watch the bottom of people鈥檚 legs 鈥?and the whole of small dogs 鈥?walk past!The location is great, on a quiet residential street with a park opposite. Okay so you are not particularly in the centre of things 鈥?it is a fair hike or a 15-minute tram ride to Dam Square and Centraal Station 鈥?however you are just round the corner from the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum, a short-ish walk across Singelgracht to the Leidseplein and very close to Vondelpark. It is blissfully quiet 鈥?another aid to a good night鈥檚 sleep 鈥?although occasionally we could hear latecomers or early risers heading up and down the wooden stairs in the hotel.As for the staff, well, they were great. Friendly, helpful, efficient and another credit to the hotel.You鈥檒l probably have guessed that I rather enjoyed our stay at Piet Hein! I did and I would certainly go back. Very, very recommended

<Content>Curate's Egg I visited with two children during the February half term 2005. At 150 euros a night we were disappointed to find a triple room was effectively a small twin with a third bed pushed into the corner. The bathroom was unventilated, and barely lit by a 40 watt bulb. It was cold and dank and malodorous after heavy use... Whenever we increased the heat in the room the hot air that came through smelled of cigarettes. Horror!!Having said all that, the room itself was spotless. There were always fresh towels, mainly because used towels wouldn't dry in the bathroom, but they were large and fluffy and welcome. The bedlinen was all white cotton, which was a joy, and the TV was a decent size for moments when the kids needed to chill out. The staff weren't particularly friendly but they were fantastically efficient and the common part downstairs was very pretty and had everything from a bar to internet access. The hotel is right by the museums and walking distance of everywhere, though we got trams to save time. Ultimately the good outweighed the bad, really it did, and I'd recommend the hotel, but three nights in a small space with fag smells in the air was enough.

<Content>Lovely hotel, brilliant location A+++++ Our family stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in July last year, and had a wonderful time. The location of the hotel is perfect. On a map it seems a bit out of the way but in actuality the hotel is only 10 minutes from the rijksmuseum and van gogh museum and 5 minutes from the Leidsplein. This was especially good as the the Leidsplein seems to be the centre for eating out - plenty of fantastic restaurants to choose from, all with outdoor seating for summer. Just down from the Leidsplein is the waterbus stop which gets you to all the tourist attractions in the most scenic (although most expensive) way, and there are also plenty of tram stops. Behind the hotel is the most fashionable shopping street, and in front is vondel park which holds open air concerts in summer.The hotel itself was nicely decorated with a nautical theme. The rooms were fairly basic but comfotable and modern with tv and a/c. Breakfast was a simple continental buffet, with boiled eggs, cold meats, cereal, toast and a vending machine for tea, coffee, hot chocolate etc.. this we found delicious and more than adequate. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the rooms were cleaned daily. All in all, excellent value for money and we would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Simply great, affordable, clean, friendly! I stayed here Feb. 18-21, 2005 and loved it. They were kind enough to allow me an early check-in, and the breakfast they serve (included!) was very yummy, especially when compared to hotel breakfasts i sampled in Paris/London later in my trip.This place was very clean, and although my room was small, i loved it. it had a nice view of the courtyard garden, and clean and modern bathroom and all the necessities.I got a great rate on Expedia.com, and would most definitely stay at this wonderful hotel again.It is about a mile walk from centraal station, hotel piet hein is located in a lovely and quiet neighborhood near vondel park. tram stops are very close, as are shopping.

<Content>Delightful confirmation of Reviews Because of unexpected last minute trip changes, we turned up two days before we'd reserved our room. We were lucky and there was a cancellation, so we got the only empty room. The staff was friendly and helpful, even showing us how to trim the tulips we purchased at the nearby Flower Market. The location is excellent. The Rijks Museum and the Concert Hall are literally around the corner. We walked everywhere in the Center, and there are nearby tram stops so that we effortlessly kept appointments in the suburbs. The room was simple , comfortable, very clean, with a new, nicely appointed bathroom. We're already looking forward to going back.
