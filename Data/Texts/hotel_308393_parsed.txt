<Content>Pricey City First allocated room smelt strongly of cigarettes, so asked for another. First impression was better, larger, clean and sweet smelling, (out of the frying pan into the fire) After going for a walk and something to eat we returned to our room to catch up on some much needed sleep as we had been travelling for 14 hours. This proved to be impossible as right underneath our room, workmen were refurbishing; hammering, drilling and sawing. We phoned the reception but were told there was no other room, my husband then went down to reception only to be met by other couples looking for a room move because of the noise. All we were told was they would be finishing soon. We decided to get a sunbed around the pool and try to sleep there, not very comfortable. Apart from this the hotel was located well, the staff were very friendly and the lounge bar had good entertainment. The drinks were extortionate but found this to be the case in most places we visited.

<Content>Good quality Due to a travel agent error was originally booked into the Allson hotel for the return stay with the Singapore Airlines Stopover deal. After a wait the staff there arranged an 'upgrade' to the Miramar hotel for us.Was very impressed despite on arrival the bellhop took our bags to our room to find the maid still making it, after an arguement between the 2 and a call to the front desk he had us wait on that floor, went downstairs, picked up our new room key, came and got us and took us to our room. An easy mistake but it was handled really well by the staff.The room was large clean and possibly had one of the most effective air conditioners i've experienced, the room was just like a freezer, which in my opinion for a hotel especially in Singapore is a good thing. Hotel was fantastic in my opinion, clean, comfortable bed and nice shower. Only thing that did let it down a little say compared to the Allson would have been location, but overall would definately recommend the place, especially as part of the Singapore Airlines stopover deals. Word of advice if your flight leaves really late, take the late checkout option, gives you the option to have a relax in your room and a nice shower before flying out, costs a few extra $$ but definately worth it especially with the heat and humidity.

<Content>Acceptable with a few minor complaints It was with mixed feelings that my husband and I requested accommodation at the Hotel Miramar, as some of the reviews here were not very positive. It would seem the mixed reviews are deserved in our experience. We had one night on the way to KL and two nights on the way back to Darwin (home). On arrival on the outward leg, we were efficiently checked-in to the hotel only to find we were on a smoker's floor and our room STANK of stale tobacco. However we made the best of it, had room service dinner (prompt service, pleasant meal) and enjoyed the included buffet breakfast the next morning. We left our bag (one, as the bulk of our luggage was left at the airport) at the hotel for the day and went sight-seeing. On returning, we used the hospitality room and that shower was very welcome...I'm sure our fellow plane travellers would have agreed! When we came back a week later, we had been upgraded to a room on the Executive floor...sounds posh! It was a slightly larger room than the standard and didn't stink of stale tobacco...unfortunately we could CLEARLY smell the mould which grows on the outside of the building and despite recent renovations, this is obviously inside as well. However, we can't fault the hotel's service as they allowed us to check in very early (it was around 10am when we arrived) and nothing was ever too much trouble during both stays. My husband wanted to check his e-mail so enquired as to using the Business Centre in the lobby - and was told it would be SING$10 per 30 minutes...that's OUTRAGEOUS so he politely declined. Perhaps our expectations had been raised during our 7 nights in KL, but the breakfast offerings the following two mornings didn't seem quite as good as before. Overall, if you're staying a night or two, this is a reasonably good hotel. The location isn't bad unless you really want to be near Orchard Rd or Marina Bay, as the nearest MRT is in Chinatown (about a 15 minute walk from the hotel), so getting to other parts of Singapore is easy and cheap enough. We didn't use the shuttle bus as we didn't need it. We might stay again if it's a couple of nights, but would shop around for a nicer hotel for a longer stay. Oh, this hotel seems to appeal to the older traveller as many of our fellow guests must have been retirees and a few were practically in their dotage. :)

<Content>Most Pleasant Stay We used this site to find a good hotel to stay in as a stopover to Sydney. Judging from the reviews we felt this sounded as good as any. We can honestly say that we were not disappointed. We found the hotel clean, atmostphere pleasant and staff extemely helpful. We ate in the restaurant and the food was very good and reasonably priced. We stayed for two days on our way out and were fortunate to be upgraded to an executive room and one night on our return. On a few reviews some people complained that they were put in a musty smelling room - we had one on our way back but it is in the old part of the hotel and musty is old! The room was clean and had all facilities to make an overnight stay comfortable. The hotels was well placed for the Quays and easily walkable to Raffles for the Singaport Sling!They also had a hote hopper bus to take you to China Town etc.All in all an extremely enjoyable stay.

<Content>Loved the Miramar Booked this hotel through Singapore Airlines Stopover Holidays. We had one night booked to have a rest between flights from London to Auckland.Our flight arrived at 8am and check-in time wasn't until 2pm. However, we went to the hotel at 10am on the off-chance they would let us check in early and they did - didn't even have to ask, they had already allocated us a room early and with extended check-out time too.It was a smoking room, only evidenced by the ashtray, the room did not smell of smoke at all.The bed was firm and comfortable. Good night sleep and feel refreshed for our next flight.

<Content>Very kind people here We arrived absolutely shattered after a much delayed flight and twenty-one hours on a plane; the lovely, sympathetic hotel staff immediately upgraded us to a HUGE room with a palatial bathroom and let us have a very late check-out. The food in the hotel restaurant was good and the whole experience was very soothing!

<Content>Worst Hotel I stayed for two nights---1st morning there wasn't any water for a shower and the 2nd morning the water was black! If you want to stay here make sure they know well in advance that you want a Non Smoking room as they only have 2 Non Smoking floors. The 1st room they took me to was dreadful--it was so smokey.Think hard before you book as there as are so many good hotels in Singapore!

<Content>Adequate Three-night stay in September 2008 for a conference elsewhere in town, at the negotiated conference rate of S$250/night, booked directly with the hotel. The hotel was so-so, probably 3 stars for the hotel room and 4 for the open spaces, and 2 for the recreational facilities. They had one of the most pathetic gyms I've ever seen in a hotel: a treadmill and 3 weight machines in a room that was about 8 by 12 feet. Strangely, it was only open from 7a-7p, despite being unmanned. The outdoor pool was small, open 7a-7p, with no hot tub. They had some sort of spa on site, but I didn't visit it.The hotel's two main elevators were incredibly slow, and several nights there was room service refuse left in the halls all night. Internet costs S$28 per 24 hours for wireless, which was way too much. The morning breakfast buffet was generous, and had some good vegetarian/vegan offerings. It was included with my S$250 room rate.My room had two twin beds, basic furnishings, a hot pot with instant coffee and a small tea selection, and no alarm clock. Basic cable TV. Clean, and not uncomfortable, but far from posh.

<Content>Miramar Riverside, good location,excellent service. Spent 6 days at Miramar. Found staff to be of high standards.Nothing was a problem for them,even local information regarding tours and prices at marketsand bus times and which one to catch.Restuarant served good food and catered for locals as well as fussy Aussies.Buffet breakfast was great.The 2 complaints I had was:1/ the bed was too hard for me,[but I like soft beds] a lot would find it great.2/ There were black long[not short and curly] hairs everywhere in bathroom[as bathroom was white it was easy to see] and in a tea cup.After that I rinsed cup out with boiling water before using.I had used the teaspoon to eat a cream[chocolate]cake and that afternoon could see smears of cream residue on spoon as if it had been wiped with a cloth.There was a reveiw in 60 minutes regarding [in Assie 5 star] hotel cleaners of rooms .This program made me aware of what cleaners actually clean and what they use to clean !I always thought they replaced cups and glasses everyday but it doesnt appear so.I believe it must happens in most hotels worldwide.

<Content>Fine for a short stay If you are looking for a hotel to use as a Singapore stopover for a few nights then the Miramar is value for money and worth considering. The rooms are small and although we were told that there was room for an additional bed for our daughter we felt cramped. An attempt to update the bathroom with chrome, mirrors and downlighters has been successful. There was a strange fusty smell in our room, which we think was caused by the combination of airconditioning, lack of ventilation and fitted carpets getting damp. We used the shuttle bus to get in and out of the city, but found the taxi service cheap and reliable, apart from Sunday night when there seemed to be a distinct shortage of taxis in Orchard Road. There is a small gym close to the pool which says it is open 7.00a.m. but can actually be accessed at all hours with your room key. Yes I know this sounds sad, but when jet lag hits in the early hours of the morning there's not much else to do! The swimming pool looks unloved, but is very quiet, there are plenty of towels and it's a nice place to visit in the late afternoon. Breakfasts were part of our deal, and were fine. Plenty of coffee, and the usual self service choices. I think that we would have looked for alternatives if we had to pay the $19 cost. We particularly appreciated the hospitality rooms which we used before our early evening flight.

<Content>Miramar exceeded expectations I stopped over in Singapore for a couple of days on my way home from London to Australia. The Miramar Hotel was recommended to me by others. The staff were pleasant and helpful and the superior room was very clean and good size. The hotel is close to the Singapore river and a short walk to all the outdoor riverside eateries. Highly recommend for short stay visitors.

<Content>Ok hotel for a stopover My wife and I stopped at the Miramar mid-April as a stopover on the way back to the UK from Borneo. As a stopover hotel this establishment was adequate for our needs. Clean room, firm bed, good hot shower, tea and coffee in the room etc. We had a Premier room with a crazy coloured carpet (see pictures on the website). I can't go into to much detail about this place as we weren't there very long but, the pool area is overlooked by two or three tall hotel blocks and didn't feel very inviting. The hotel itself is clean and we were treated well by the staff. There is a bar next to the lobby which has karaoke. I went in briefly to look at the cocktails menu after a trip to the night safari (I will add a review for this soon). I didn't stay in the bar long as the song that was being murdered was being sung at a volume that made my ears bleed.I can't comment on the food either as we left at 6am next morning and didn't sample the breakfast. Location wise, the hotel doesn't seem to be close to anything really. We had a fifteen minute walk down to the World City shopping centre, and it isn't close to the MRT either. Overall, this hotel is good for a stopover but I would not use it as a base for a longer stay.

<Content>Reasonable hotel for stopover visit Having read some of the reviews of this hotel, we were a little apprehensive. However, for a stopover hotel it is more than adequate. We stayed there for 2 nights in two interconnecting rooms which our young children thought were fab - our daugther particularly appreciated the slippers and dressing gown (adult sized but she didn't care!). The rooms were a reasonable size and the hotel staff were very helpful. It is some distance from Singapore central but this really isn't a problem - taxis are amazingly cheap. If you do visit with young kids, we recommend the Night Safari (fantastic place and ideal to do if you've arrived at night after a very long plane journey with kids that think it's morning - a visit here will wear them out enough to then sleep through the night). The zoo is also wonderful and not too large - the water play area was much appreciated. Sentosa island is also worth a visit.

<Content>Excellent All-round We stayed for just one night at the Miramar in October 2007 on our way from the UK to Australia. We had a 3 year old with us and would definitley recommend this hotel for a short stay like ours.The staff were very courteous and the room we had (just a standard double) well appointed. Love the bathrobes and little slippers - a nice touch in a hotel which only cost us 拢60 for the night for the 3 of us, through our travel agent. The only thing is the baths are a bit small (as per most Asian hotels) however this really isn't a problem as the shower was very good. Very clean room and a rollaway bed provided for my daughter and our bed was a King size. This did make the room a little tight for space, but for one night it was fine.We ate both dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant. There is plenty of local food as well as a few Western dishes and a few Italian dishes like spaghetti bolognese, which was great for my daughter. They were very flexible and brought her a half portion and charged accordingly. We had local food which was prepared quickly, tasted good and was beautifully presented. Breakfast also offers plenty of choice, with a chef making omlettes up for you with your choice of filling as well as local dishes. The waiting staff were really helpful, attentive and spoke good English as well as paying my daughter lots of attention.We also had a few cocktails in the bar when we arrived, which is great when the heat gets too much, or you can sit outside. Be aware that during happy hour when you finish you drink they just bring you another one all the time, so you do end up drinking loads! Probably just as well in that humidity though!We highly recommend flying with Singapore airlines because the little yellow SIA bus stops right outside. It takes you all around the City and to Orchard Road, etc. The bus also sells water bottles for a really cheap price as well. You get on the bus for a discounted price if you show your airline boarding cards. We didn't find the hotel too far out at all, and provides a nice walk to Clarke Quay.Would definiltey recommend this hotel for a short break.

<Content>Too far from MRT: othewise OK While Singapore is undoubtedly the most plastic and boring place in Asia, this inadequacy is partly made up by its excellent MRT and reasonable bus systems.Unfortunately the Miramar is too far from the MRT: it ia a good 15 minute walk and as I found on a Sunday morning when dragging a suitcase, a Westerner rapidly becomes sweaty.The room was fine with no external noise evident. It was sufficiently dark during the night.Breakfast was adequate though lacking the sophistication evident in some Filipino hotel breakfasts. Bu then again this is Singapore, and many first time travellers come here so mediocrity tends to rule.All in all, fine for a short stopover but for a longer stay, a hotel closer to an MRT station would be preferable.

<Content>Singapore!!!! Stopped at the Miramar for 3 nights following stays in KL and Penang.My party included wife and 16 year old daughter and 12 year old son.We were directed to 2 rooms on the 13th floor that were smoking rooms which we immediately rejected.We were relocated to rooms 907 and 909 in the main block.The rooms were adequate but required refurbishment as they were tired.Apparently the rooms in the more modern wing are better and housed China Airlines personnel.There were only 2 lifts which made for a lot of waiting time,breakfast was fine although hetic and the weekend compared to week mornings.Happy hour 4-8 in the bar was a bonus.The hotel was a 15 minute walk to the nearest MRT station at Chinatown or Clarkes Quay,taxi $3/5 SPD was a better option due to the heat.,ensure you take a metered Cab.We did all the tourist attractions but despite being spotless Singapore lacked character and was expensive.We went to Chinatown,Little India (avoid on a Sunday it is busier than Calcutta!!!),Raffles,The Zoo and Santosa (What an awful experience that was)Santosa is undergoing major development making the Cable Car ride in from Mount Faber a dusty experience!!.The beaches and Coves look better from the air and indeed when we reached them were not useable due to oil pollution.I cannot see how the authorities can allow this to have been developed so close to a major shipping lane,the place the attractions are totally manufactured and expensive,please do not waste your time or money visiting

<Content>A good Hotel We stayed here for 3 nights en route to Australia.Our room was fine and we particularly enjoyed the buffet dinners and breakfasts in the restaurant.The staff were very helpful.The hotel is maybe a little remote, but the free shuttle bus worked well and if it had been a little less humid we could probably have walked further. There were always taxis available.The pool area was a little neglected but we did have an enjoyable swim one evening. There were no pool towels but on ringing some were brought up immediately.We had an early departure and were pleasantly surprised to have full breakfast facilities available at 5am.All in all a good base when on a stopover.

<Content>Good value for price in Singapore We stayed in this hotel for four nights in early January 2008. This hotel is located about a 20 minute walk from the nearest subway stop, which is a bit further than what we were told by the hotel staff prior to our arrival. Clark鈥檚 Quay is about a 20 minute walk along the river and it is not much further to the Colonial district. The hotel provides a free shuttle bus to the shopping district and China town and it is possible to catch the bus for a return trip as long as you meet the bus at the same stop.We enjoyed our time in this hotel. We found the reception staff very helpful. The room was large, with nice amenities, such as an in-room safe, coffee and tea service and hair dryer. The room was very clean with complete bathroom amenities. The hotel was quiet even though it was very busy.On our last morning we needed to leave very early. Breakfast was available to us (all except the eggs) at 5 a.m. This was a nice surprise since we thought we would be given a box breakfast. Most of the buffet was available even though it was before usual opening time. This service was greatly appreciated.Even though the location is somewhat far from the public transportation we enjoyed the walks along the riverfront. Restaurants were within walking distance from the hotel. We would recommend this hotel while staying in Singapore.

<Content>Not up to scratch Booked via SingaporeAir re their Singapore stopover deals, price ok, chose hotel from second tier group in SingaporeAir list of hotels based on usual photos and proximity to the MRT train network. However the map on the hotels web site was a bit elastic with the truth re the positioning of the hotel to the nearest station which appeared to be maybe 500 metres away at most, however was around 1500 meters which is a long way in 30degree heat and high humidity. Ordered a double bed but got a twin, nice bathroom, room no better than cheaper 3* hotels. Pool nice but not enough seats and towels always running out, staff not keen to help on that one due to not getting the tips they recieve from bar sales. Pool changing rooms also filthy, hadnt been cleaned in months by the look of it. Did not eat in hotel so cant comment, probably wouldnt stay there again.

<Content>had a very comfortable stay here Our friends and ourselves stayed here in October on the way to NZ and also on the way back in December. We had very comfortable, clean rooms both times. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was in a good location - a short walk to Clarke Quay but far enough away from the centre of things so that it wasn't noisy. The Singapore Airlines hop-on/hop off bus stopped right outside the hotel, (make sure you keep your airline baggage check ticket in order to get an all day ticket for 3 dollars rather than the normal 12 dollars), and the hotel also has a free bus into the main area of town going about three times per day - so transport couldn't be easier. Taxis are also incredibly cheap. The cafeteria was good value for money especially at breakfast but evening meals were the same choice every day so it tended to get a bit boring. Drinks in the bar tended to be on the expensive side.Do not miss the Botanic Gardens (free) (and the free bus stops outside) and do go to Sentosa Island and also visit Chinatown. We booked our first stay at the hotel through a travel agent in UK but decided not to book the second stay until we had been and tried it. We obviously liked it and tried to book our second stay just before we left. We were amazed that the price quoted by the hotel was almost twice the amount we had paid through the travel agent in UK. The hotel actually advised us to ring UK and book again through our travel agent, which we did and even got it slightly cheaper than our first stay!! Singapore is lovely but make sure you have a small brolly with you at all times!!

<Content>really helpful stopover Stayed here for a stopover for 36 hours. The staff really couldn't have been more helpful and we really felt that we had relaxed and beenable to rest between flights. We arrived at 8.30 am and were allowed to use a hospitality room to shower and change in. When we emerged from there intending to store our luggage for the day until our room was available, we were told that our room was all ready for us which was great. The breakfast wasn't up to much and was expensive but we were tired so we ate there anyway. The shuttle bus for Singapore Stopovers stops right outside the hotel which was great. It wasn't so easy to find the stops along Orchard Rd though and we ended up getting a taxi back to the hotel. The taxis were so cheap though that I used them a few times after that. It was better than waiting for a bus in the heat when we were tired. We checked out the following morning, having enjoyed the pool, and left our luggage stored for the day. We were told we could have a late check-out anyway of 2.30 but we wanted to go sight-seeing. When we arrived back at the hotel about 6.30 pm it was possible to prepare for the flight by using the hospitality room again. The hotel was extremely good value, booked with Singapore Airways as part of their stopover service. I really felt we had excellent value for money. I was travelling with my son and could have felt vulnerable in a strange city but I felt quite safe and would go there again.

Poor location, officious staff and a restaurant that looked more like a military cafeteria than a hotel restaurant all contributed to a distinctly unmemorable hotel experience.Suffice it to say, I won't be rushing back here.

<Content>average Recently stayed at The Hotel Miramar Singapore for 3 nights on our way home from Australia. This hotel was ok but would not recommend it ? My travel agent told me it was in the process of being upgraded and there was a new wing finished so obviously I asked for this in my booking. We did not get this wing and the hotel is a little on the shabby side.The air conditioning machine ran all night it can't be switched off not neccessary all night as room was quite cool, if you don't request a room at the back of the hotel it is very noisey at the front no double glazing and very busy main road outside. On a positive side good value for a few nights, they did give us breakfast for three days free and a complimentary newspaper !Singapore was amazing and the hotel is only some where to put your head for the night !

<Content>Did the job but not our best choice! We booked this hotel purely because our travel agent recommended it as they had a special deal on at the time. Having read the reviews we requested a room in the new part of the hotel but I don't think we got one. The location was OK, further from the airport than other hotels we stayed in, but cabs are cheap so not really a problem. Although it was about a 10 minute walk to Clarke Quay and Chinatown its a walk along a busy 3 lane highway so not exactly pleasant. The room itself was fine - bed was hard though - but that seems typical of Singapore. No BBC World on the TV. One thing that was very strange was that the curtains did not cover the whole window, they literally pulled across a third each side leaving the middle bare (with a net), we had an early flight so it wasn't too much of a problem but if you don't like light rooms in the morning this would be annoying. We didn't visit the bar but weren't exactly inspired from the singing we could hear.

<Content>Mostly good We stayed here twice - the first time for 3 nights, then we went to Bintan Island, and then came back for 2 nights. Overall the staff are friendly and helpful. Our package included breakfast each day and that was wonderful (in fact we didn't need lunch!). The first 3 nights we were in the older part and that was just ok. The rooms were adequate, bathroom ok but the bed was very hard. When we came back we were in the newer part and that was lovely. The bed was softer and the bathroom very nice. We also found the swimming pool  surrounds nice  relaxing after being out in the heat. Another good feature of this hotel is that if you have a late flight out they will store your luggage  also, after spending the day out and about they have a small lounge  bathroom where you can have a shower, etc before you leave for the airport. This was great as after a day in the Singapore heat you definitely need it!The hotel is about a 10min walk to the nearest underground station at Chinatown and the garage next door has grocery items available if needed.

<Content>Location not great We booked into this Hotel as there were no rooms (apart from very expensive ones) in the area we normally stay in.The staff at Reception were very good, as were the men who handled the luggage, called taxis etc. The room was of a reasonable size, but could have been cleaner. I noted stains on a hard backed chair, and stains on the blue decoration pillows on the beds. Vacuuming had not done properly as there was a line of dust all along the edge of the carpet in front of the wardrobe.The room and bathroom were a little shabby, but nothing a coat of paint could not fix. There was plenty of shampoo , hand soaps and also toothbrushes , which not many hotels provide. Sheets and towels were changed every day.The location for us was most inconvenient, but with such cheap taxis, it was not a problem to hop into one whenever we wanted to go anywhere. I cannot agree that it is a 5 minute walk to the night life of Clarke Quay - it is a lot further than 5 minutes walk away. I don't think I would stay here again, but mainly because of the location. .

<Content>Good hotel in an affordable price We checked in at Hotel Miramar at around 1am. The receptionist were accomodating. When booking for a hotel, always note that you want the room IN THE NEW BUILDING. Those who hate the Miramar Hotel prolly stayed at the old building. I read here in trip advisor to request for a room in the new building. I did and we stayed in this clean and good room. It was being cleaned everyday. Here is what I like about the Hotel:1. Clean room and complete amenities.2. The pool was great. Not much people so it was ok and we enjoyed the good view.3. We had a free breakfast. The breakfast buffet was awesome and complete. 4. The people who works at Miramar ARE EXCELLENT AND ACCOMODATING.5. They have a free shuttle service to Orchard Road and Chinatown. 6. All the cab drivers know Miramar Hotel.7. You can ask for the adapator (plugs) at the receptionist.8. We missed this one, but they have a bar downstairs. 9. The hotel is right next to a gasoline station and they have a convenience store.10. The Hotel is situated in a peaceful and beautiful area.11. You can walk to Chinatown and Clarke Quay (long walk).12. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and many taxis are waiting outside the hotel.13. There is also a souvenir shop near the staircase. The shirts and biscuits are way cheaper than those at Sentosa. The price of the souvenirs are excellent!

<Content>Ideal stopover hotel. We stayed at the Miramar for a 3 night stopover on our way to Australia. Having read some of the previous reviews we were very pleasantly surprised. We had an upgraded room, through booking early. It was spacious, very clean and comfortable, bed and bedding excellent. The bathroom was also clean with all amenities. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. The swimming pool was a relaxing spot after a morning's sightseeing. The breakfast was very good, lots of choices. We had a snack on our arrival evening and one evening meal in the restaurant, both of which were good. The location is close to the river, a short stroll from Clark Quay, where there are numerous restaurants. We were very impressed with Singapore, its cleanliness and the friendly people. The trips we did (which can be booked from the hotel) were excellent, and a Singapore Sling at Raffles is a must!From our experience we would certainly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Some Trick photography in the advertising The main saving graces of this hotel are the helpful and friendly staff and the fact the windows open to let the smell out!! I burst out laughing when I saw the gym, it is a converted closet and is so small the treadmill has to be put on an angle to fit. I've had two broken TV sets in a row (Maybe a rock band stayed there before me).

<Content>Excellent hotel - Miramar Singapore What a find this hotel was. The hotel has undergone refurbishment and I guess we got a refurbished room, unlike some of the other reporters on this forum. Our room was fantastic, large comfortable , well equipped, with large bathroom and all usual amenties in the room. The bed was a delight - so comfortable, with sumptious quilt and bedding (maybe the other reporters stayed in a different hotel!!!). I got the hotel at a bargain 拢55GBP per night BB. The location is great, 5mins walk from Clarke Quay and all it's nightlife - the only hotel in Singapore with a better location is the Novotel Clark Quay, and that was 50% more exspensive. This hotel is highly recommended, and would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>was okay Location of Hotel Miramar is very good ,very near to all shopping centres ,staff were freindly. Overall was not satisfyied with the conditions of the rooms. The rooms needed a good clean up,and needs new beddings. I would not rate it as a 3.5 or 4 star Hotel as it says on the net.

<Content>Quick visit to Singapore Stayed at Hotel Mirimar. Arrived 7.30am and they found us a room straight away. The hotel porters were very friendly and helpful our whole stay. Hotel is close enough to walk if want, to town, busses across the road, taxi's going past all the time.China Town was excellent. We went in Jan so was close to Chinese New Year. Sentosa is a must to visit. The cable car and the sky tower. Orchard Rd shops are just so expensive why bother going. The mall in the Harbour area is good. Walking down the canal area is lovely at night. Felt safe.Raffles is another must. What a place - what history.Had some trips on the underground train. Awsome set up.

<Content>Good Location Stayed here for 4 nights on the way to Penang - it is in a good location. Cross the road by the garage and follow the river to Boat and Clarke Quay (about 20 min walk). Garage good for water and such. Staff where fine - breakfast good.The pool area is disappointing, but we didn't intend to use it anyway as too busy sightseeing. Make sure you include a Singapore Sling at Raffles and Singapore Zoo was fantastic.This is a good base to explore Singapore and if you're travelling with Singapore Airlines, save your boarding cards - use the SIA Hop-on which stops right outside the door of the hotel for S$3 - the service is great, use it to jump on and off at various areas. It also goes to Sentosa but you have to swap bus - the driver will explain this to you.Would stay here again

<Content>Average Compared to our accommodation in Bangkok  Australia the Miramar was definitely only average but it was clean  comfortable if a little dated in places.The rooms were a good size with comfy beds. Bathroom was clean but could have done with additional towels, ideally slightly thicker ones!We only ate in the restaurant for our included breakfast which was OK  although the dinner buffet looked nice the lack of atmosphere motivated us to go outside.The bar was v expensive outside of the happy hour  the house group were definitely not SIN's finest singers!The outdoor pool was nice, quiet, clean  warm but the gym was just a small room with a treadmill  a few weights!However, for the money the Miramar was adequate but if you have the budget I would suggest spending a bit more.

<Content>Don't stay here!! This hotel's only saving grace was Ronnie, the bell captain who was wonderful and always smiling. All other staff were abrupt and it felt like anything we asked was a hassle. I was disappointed almost from the moment we arrived. Don't try to find out from the tour desk how to get anywhere by yourself if they have a tour going there as they will simply snigger at you and tell you to do the tour! We wanted an adventure without the price tag and this wasn't an option apparently! We worked it out ourselves. If you are looking for a friendly, helpful, relaxing environment, do NOT stay at the Hotel Miramar in Singapore! It will only cause you stress and frustration!

<Content>Very dirty hotel rooms We stayed at the Miramar on the final night of our Honeymoon, paying extra for a Superior Room. This hotel might be ok of you have paid for a 2 star hotel - but it is very different to the website and is certainly not worth paying 4-5 star rates.The room itself was very dirty. The carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom was filthy. In our room there were marks all over the wall where something had been spilt and not cleaned up. Having stayed in Singapore many times, I would certainly not stay here again. For the same price, pick one of the hotels in town. The Swisshotel is a fabulous choice and worth paying the extra money for.

<Content>Miramar Hotel, Singapore - a great place to stay We recently stayed at the Miramar Hotel, Havelock Road, Singapore and found the staff and everyone at the hotel to be very friendly and helpful.Our room was really nice with a river outlook, a very good size and the bed was most confortable. Cleaning was carried out quite early after breakfast and always completed to our satisfaction. Sheets and towels were changed every day. The meals in the Ferntree Cafe were excellent - plenty of variety - well presented and good prices.this hotel is located on the river at Robertson Quay next to Clarke and Boat Quays so is in a very good position. We highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again when we next visit SingaporeJean and Bill RossAdelaide, South AustraliaDecember 2006

<Content>Last Stop not the best but........ As many of you that will be passing through Singapore will like us be on a one to four night stopover you may not worry too much what the hotel is like. So as we came to check in all i was fussed about at the time was a nice soft bed. As you do you dump your bags on the floor and land on the bed to check for bounceability.This time i didn't bounce back. Might as well have slept on railway sleepers as it was that soft.The decor is a bit oldy worldy. Perhaps needs a facelift all round.Mini bar was exactly that MINI. Not that we use them anyway but don't expect anything more than a few cans of beer and the same in Seven Up and Coke.Can't fault the staff. All of them were superb.The entertainment in The Brass Rail Bar in the evening consists of a group of four singers. Three of which are very lovely young ladies who will appeal greatly to tired and weary male travellers.Some nice complimentary snap around 9-10pm as well which was most welcome.

<Content>Nice price, nice experience We chose to stay at this hotel because we were offered a discounted stay due to the fact that we were flying with Singapore Airlines. The room was comfortable, with a TV, tea and coffee making facilities and a lovely view over the river and out to the city. The hotel is situated about 15 minutes walk from Orchard Road, the main shopping district in Singapore. We liked the location, however, because it is away from the noise and bustle of Orchard Road but still within walking distance of everything. It can get quite hot in Singapore, however, so we usually took the bus to get to places. There is a bus stop right outside the door of the hotel.There is an outdoor pool in the hotel which is simple but pleasant and a nice place to cool down after the day's shopping! In the evening, there is entertainment provided in the hotel bar. When we were there, the entertainment was usually in the form of different singing groups.The hotel's restaurant serves a la carte and buffet dinners but has a limited selection of western food so be prepared to try some things that you've never eaten before if you do choose to eat here!When booking this hotel, I would recommend that you ask for a room in the newer section of the building. The rooms in the older section are fine but you get a bit more space and more modern decor if you get a room in the new section.I would say that this hotel is no better or worse than other hotels of this price range in Singapore and, while I may choose to stay somewhere else on another visit, I would recommend the Hotel Miramar for a comfortable, enjoyable stay in Singapore.

<Content>Perfectly adequate We stayed at the Miramar at the end of our 19 day Malaysia/Singapore train and ferry adventure. We had slept in 5 star+ resorts and on rocking overnight trains so the Miramar was an option to extend our holiday a bit without costing too much.We arrived at 9 am and were immediately given our room (the norm in Singapore I have found) which had a nice view of the river, a nice big bed, a big bath and the coldest fridge in the world. That is the Miramar in one word-nice.Nothing could be mistaken for five star. The pool is a little too small and clumsily situated, the bar is a bit crass and the lobby is a little bit too crowded and busy BUT The Miramar is friendly and great value for money.It has possibly the cheapest, longest happy 'hour' in Singapore. 3 PM to 9 PM!The only real complaint is they wouldn't allow us a late check-out without us paying extra. Not a real problem as they have a courtesy room for later use but this is the only Singapore hotel I have stayed in that insisted on a 12 noon check-out.

<Content>Make sure you get what you paid for. We booked this hotel from Thomas Cook in the UK. When we booked, included in the package were two interconnecting rooms, one of which was to have an extra bed for our third child. The package also included full breakfasts for all five of us for the two mornings we were there.On arrival at the hotel we were pleased to be shown into our rooms, as we had arrived on an early flight and weren't sure whether we would be able to check in early. Given our jetlag, this was a godsend.However, there was no extra bed. The Front desk told us we would have to pay extra for it. However when we argued that this had been included they grudgingly let us have it. Then the next morning we were informed that we would also have to pay for the 5th breakfast, and it took some doing to convince them that this had been included, despite the fact that it was clearly written on our hotel voucher.The rooms were fairly tired and uninspiring and we felt that we had been given some of the hotel's worst rooms.The best part of our stay here was the service given by the porters and the man on the concierge desk, who managed to get us onto a fabulous boat trip at the last minute. He couldn't have been more helpful - what a contrast to the staff on the front desk.

<Content>A great hotel Lovely hotel near to Clarke quay and Robertson quay.Staff excellent from bell boys to restaurant staff.Plenty of space in room and a free safe.Only downside, Tour east rep when we asked about shuttle bus, told us it would be 15 minutes. Was private taxi that driver takes you to electronics store at Orchard Road, and then you get sent by them to the Jewellery store etc. Told under no obligation to buy but very pressurised. Have to go back to same place to get taxi called back. Free taxi service because rep/driver get commission if you buy instore. Ask front desk staff in future.
