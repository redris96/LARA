<Content>You Decide PROS-lightning fast check in/check out-reception staff friendly enough-clean rooms (though a little old and worn), average 3-star quality-firm but not too uncomfortable beds with clean linens-amazing location, few steps away from Temple St. Night Market and Nathan Rd., in the heart of Tsim Sha TsuiCONS-free breakfast is meager + rude staff = give it a pass-room we got had dim lighting, bad A/C and no windows, it felt a little claustrophobic and suffocating and we did not get a good night's sleep-there was a general feeling of creepiness in the hotel and especially in our room, I wouldn't have been surprised to see a ghost floating aroundA room with windows and a working A/C would have made a world of difference. If we were staying there for more than just a night, I probably would have asked to be moved to a better room. I'm sure the Evergreen has better rooms than the one we got. For the price and awesome location, Evergreen is definitely worth a look especially for travelers on a budget.

<Content>Great for those on a budget We were a group of 5. Got two rooms through Agoda, a triple sharing and a twin. We all had separate bunks. One room had no window and we were all really cramped. The restroom was decent and clean, complete with the basic toiletries . Breakfast, though complimentary, was awful, you cannot eat it. We only had bread, butter (or was it margarine?) and coffee. You are better off at the 7-11 downstairs. The frontdesk personnel and concierge were friendly and helpful, and was kind enough to give us our much needed directions for travel. The concierge even went out of his way to show us which bus to ride for us to see the festival of lights show.The location of the hotel is very near jordan station. Just across the hotel, you will find an indian resto, and a dessert place. Downstairs is a reasonably priced chinese resto. Around the corner, yat bun dimsum is the best!This hotel comes with no frills. If you intend to go shopping the whole day, and just need a place to sleep and shower, this is for you. Do not expect anything beyond the ordinary. Safe too.

<Content>Excellent Excellent! Since I was a child I had wanted to visit HK and when a birthday with a 0 came around I decided it was time to do so, on my own. The Evergreen was excellent value, in an excellent location for shopping, MTR etc, Temple Street Night Market 1 minute walk away. The free internet access and free laundry were Godsends, as was the 7-11 right next door, and the Delicious Cafe on the other side of the hotel. The staff there were very friendly, helpful and I honestly don't have a bad word to say about the place! The breakfast is monotonous, yes, but really not bad. Special mention to Jackie the bellboy! The lift only goes up to the third floor but its really not too much of a problem, that is the single downside of the place. I can't wait to go back.

<Content>Location!!! Stayed for a night. Our room is in the 4F. Elevator is only up to 3F, so we walked from 3F (so if you have lots of luggage, ask for a lower rooms). Hotel is okay, nice staff, clean room, clean linen. There's complimentary buffet breakfast, but not good though! Restos are all around, its not a problem. This is not a 5 star, so dont expect too much. WHat's good also in this hotel is quiet. You can have a good sleep after a heavy shopping.Well, room price is cheap but location is great. A minute walk to Temple street (night market), and near to MTR. If you're into walking, lots of shops and shops and shops... tiring though..diverse shopppers were bumper to bumper! Bought my lovely winter coat for half the price back home :-))))

<Content>Great value I had never been to Hong Kong before and was a little anxious to be landing in a large unfamiliar city alone. I wanted to stay somewhere that was central and safe. I definitely made the right choice with the Evergreen! While definitely NOT FANCY, it was clean, safe, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. I got the airport transfer and that was good too, as I was worried about finding the hotel because I arrived at night. The Evergreen is VERY well-located for public transport and for seeing a lot of the things Hong Kong is renowned for (eg. markets)I was grateful for the free breakfast. Again, this was hardly what you'd call 'gourmet' food but it definitely did the job and there was plenty of it- as I was trying not to spend too much money, it was a big help. The internet was really fast and there always seemed to be a free terminal whenever I needed to use it.My room was pretty basic. The bed was quite hard and I got a little cold at one point and had to ask for extra blankets - I think maybe the air conditioning was up too high. And I had a lovely view of a brick wall out my window. So, not exactly glamorous!Overall, I would say if you're looking for a place for a romantic getaway or a luxurious relaxing holiday, then the Evergreen is not for you. But if, like me, you just want a clean and convenient place to store yourself while you're asleep so that you can get out there the rest of the time and explore the city, then definitely consider it.

<Content>A Great Value Hotel....Fantastic We chance upon this hotel when we were browsing through the net for a good value hotel since we were going to stay for six nights in Hong Kong. And what more...of all the hotels we browsed through, this was the only one which offered a quad room that sleeps comfortably for 4 adults and we were paying only about HK1,200 nett (inclusive of breakfast) per night.What a value considering the prices of hotels in HK. The location was fantastic...smack right in the shopping area of Kowloon (Temple Street, Jade Street, Nathan Road, etc) and if you take a half-hour stroll , you can reach Tsim Sha Tsui area where the waterfront is and also the Arena of Stars. Food is abundant (and affordable) almost round the clock around the hotel and a 7-11 is just besides it. And two fantastic value services which one could not find in almost all hotels are (1) unlimited free internet usage -24/7-and comes even with a printer (2) free laundry which is very useful when one is staying on for a longer period.The only little set-back was the breakfast. It has the exact same menu every morning. The only positive note for the breakfast is at least the calories are listed for each different type of food so at least, it is good for those who are health concious.By and all, no complaints about Evergreen and we will certainly stay in this hotel again if ever we visit Hong Kong again.cheers.........CK, Malaysia

<Content>Affordable no-frills hotel I booked a single ensuite room at this hotel for 5 nights. I got a double room which was cozy and outdated in terms of decor, but clean and functional. There was a full bath, kettle, a/c, cable tv, closet. Most of the people on my floor appeared to be businessmen -- this seems like an ideal hotel for people who don't plan to spend much time hanging around the hotel, who just want a clean place to sleep and a good base for touring around HK. It's definitely not a high-luxury place but it doesn't pretend to be--and for the price, I found it to be extremely good value and unlike other places I've stayed in HK, I had no problems. The hotel reception was very helpful and efficient. I arrived at 1pm and was shown my room immediately (check in is at 2pm) and I was able to leave my luggage there for several hours on the day I checked out. The location is great--just off Nathan Road about 2 minutes' walking distance from the Jordan MTR station. It's a very busy area popular with tourists because of the night markets. Hong Kong is quite small so you could taxis (quite cheap) but the MTR is clean, quick and convenient and the Jordan station is just a few stops from Central. I took the Airport Express train from the airport to Kowloon station, and then a quick taxi ride to the hotel.There are several computers for high-speed internet access (although only one was working when I visited), laundry facilities, and a small breakfast room -- breakfast is fine for a few pieces of toast or congee, but don't expect too much. There is a 7-11 right next door for water, snacks, instant noodles...(You can Google this hotel before booking to get a better price than may be offered by the hotel directly--I paid around $70/night including breakfast, booking just a few days in advance.)

<Content>Small but great!! Booked the hotel via a local travel agent. We got better rate than booking directly with the hotel. Note that the room rate usually increases on Fridays and Saturdays.Travelled to HK by the ferry from Macau, we arrived at Kowloon Ferry Terminal. Amazingly, it took only 10 minutes from the terminal to the hotel by taxi.The hotel service was very nice and most staff can speak good English. We had read many reviews about the room before, so we didn't expect too much about the room size. Actually, it's quite cozy and simply fit for 2 people!! Also, all necessary equipments are well packed in the room.However, it's true that the bed is a bit small and there is limited space for luggages, but, well, it's just a place to sleep and it's only 6-8 hours in the room!!The hotel breakfast is just fair, but you should try the difference, especially the orange juice!! - - Look for another breakfast?? We recommend a restaurant next to the hotel where you can find a lot of local noodle menus.Well, I still think this is a good place to stay. It would be safer than staying in a guesthouse. Just only 5-minute walk to Jordan MTR, that is a perfect location.

<Content>LOVED IT - a little noisy though What can I say, you would not get a better hotel at this price. Ok, it may look a little tacky, the rooms are quite small, it can be quite noisy. But WHO CARES! you are in HK, the hotel is located in a great location, it's safe, the hotel staff are excellent, and it's cheap. Don't come here if you are expecting the Ritz, you can go there and spend 4x the price. The evergreen was perfect for the 6 of us, spread over 3 rooms and 2 floors. We loved it, we had a blast and we will come back. Oh, did I mention the free internet? Thanks Evergreen Hotel!

<Content>My second home away from home As usual, everytime I'm in Hongkong, Evergreen is still it. Not fabulous, tiny, yes, but very satisfactory. Since you are out shopping and sightseeing the whole day, why the need for a 5 star hotel? A boutique hotel like Evergreen will do. The staff are always smiling, friendly and helpful. Breakfast is simple, filling and healthy. The location is so strategic. One block from the famous Temple St. night market and Nathan Road, two MTR stations away from another shopping great, Mongkok. Five minutes away from the Jordan MTR station. One minute away from a small wet market for fresh vegetables and fruits. One block away from Wing On Department store. 10 minutes bus ride to Star Ferry. Given all these information, i don't see any reason why one will not opt to stay at Evergreen. So simple. Reasonable and ever reliable Evergreen.

<Content>Absolutely fine I was in Hong Kong for a gift fair so all accommodation at this time is quite expensive. I chose this hotel because I was faliliar with the location and it had quite good reviews and the price was fantastic. I was not disappointed. The location was great, close to MTR, night market and Nathan Rd. The room whilst small was clean and hotel offered free laudry use, internet and breakfast. Pretty hard to complain unless you want all the bell  whistles!! Would definately stay there again.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel! My stay with my sister at Evergreen was really pleasant, with helpful and polite staff. The hotel, although small was clean and in a superb location, a short walk from Mong Kok, close to department stores and near the MTR. A 7-11 is next door so that was convenient.Although our room was small, it was enough space since it was only two of us. The free internet access and kettle that was provided were useful too. The only downside was the laundry service, which was only open from 4pm-10pm - the times when we were out so we had to come home early a few times to get our laundry done! The bathroom had a nice selection of toiletries and also plenty of towels available.Before arriving, I had read reviews on how the key was too big but it was a standard size and besides you can leave it at the front desk and collect it when you return.The buffet breakfast was ok I guess, but we only went once during our two week stay since we prefered to go out for breakfast instead since food in Hong Kong is not too expensive.Overall, I had a lovely stay in Hong Kong, tired from all the walking I was glad to return to this comfortable hotel after the long day of shopping with friendly staff to greet us. I am normally quite fussy when it comes to cleanliness, and this hotel satisfied my needs. It was a great location and made my stay in Hong Kong so much more enjoyable.

<Content>good little hotel We were at the Evergreen for the three nights we were in Hong Kong. The Evergreen is a great little hotel the staff do all in their power to make your stay a good one. The rooms are cleaned and the towels changed daily. I was surprised when I was told my card would be charged at the end of our stay in case we changed our mind about staying there during the three days. There were complimentary toothbrushes,toothpaste, shower caps,comb and disposable razors in the bathroom and the shower was nice and powerful. With location like this, free internet access, budget prices and great helpful staff The Evergreen is well worth a stay, I would go back any time.

<Content>Great location The location for us was great, right near the Temple St night markets and near Nathan Rd in the heart of Kowloon which we loved. We go on holiday to see other cultures and local people not hang in Hotels with other tourists. The beds are very very hard and the pillows too big. The rooms are small and outdated but like everything you get what you pay for and this place was cheap and after all we only used the Hotel basically as a place to sleep. The staff were all very friendly especially the breakfast ladies. If you are only after a cheap place to sleep then this place is good, but if you are after pampering and hanging at the Hotel look elsewhere.

<Content>It's the little things that count at Evergreen Hotel Let me get some of the minor gripes first before pointing out the merits of this small budget hotel in the heart of Kowloon.1. Yes, the rooms are small and there is no other way of describing it.2. Yes, they only issue you one room key with a ring attached to the palm-size of an evergreen tree.3. Yes, the beds (and pillows) are hard and are not the most comfy to sleep in after a day of shopping and/or sightseeing.4. Yes, the triple and quad (yes, they do have a couple of quad sharing units) rooms are on the 4th floor and the elevator reaches up only to the 3rd.Now, let's go to the small things that make Evergreen Hotel somewhat of a value for money in the midst of expensive accomodations in this city.1. Yes, they do offer free buffet breakfast. While not the most appetizing spread, it should fill you well enough to eat your lunch late.2. Yes, they do offer fast and free internet access. The internet station (with four computer terminals) on the 3rd floor is a real treat for those who want to check their emails and stuff. If you prefer to bring your own laptop, then each room has a LAN cable (inside the drawer of the small table) so you can surf in the comforts of your small unit.3. Yes, the rooms are small, but the toilet and bath surely compete in size - with a bathtub and strong shower to boot. The installed hair dryer, assorted complimentary toiletries and shower gel dispenser are amusing.4. Yes, the front desk personnel are courteous and always willing to help. And yes, they do speak English, however basic.5. Yes, the rooms are clean and tidied up everyday.And a big YES, of course, goes to the location which puts you in the middle of shopping on Nathan Road (just a kitty block away)  the Temple Street Night Market, plus loads of cheap dining options in just about every corner. Subway access to the Jordan station is likewise convenient.So, in summary, if you're on a budget, not picky and not 6 feet in height or taller (the beds are vertically-challenging for tall people), then the Evergreen Hotel is an option worth your stay.

<Content>Great Location, hard beds Booked after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor, we were allocated the 4 bed family room on the 4th floor. Lift only goes to the 3rd floor, so along with the porter we carried our luggage up the 4th floor. The room was small but adequate however no windows at all. Location is great right around the corner from the night markets and loads of restaurant options, walking distance to everything including Star Ferry if you are willing to walk 20 to 30 minutes. Breakfast was adequate although caters more to the Asian tourist market. Beds were extremely hard and short however the rooms were very clean. Staff very helpful. A vist to Shenzhen, China is a definite must for all shoppers and very easy to get to with a metro station around the corner and very helpful customer service staff at all train stations in Hong Kong - however make sure you change your money in Hong Kong and not at the train station at Shenzhen. Would stay here again.

<Content>Tiny rooms but best price and location! When I first saw our 'superior' room I was a little surprised.. it really was tiny!. But, when you look at the price and location, Who Cares!!. Breakfast was provided, although the breakfast area is kind of small, so finding a table can be an issue in busy periods. Internet access was free to the room and they also provide internet terminals. Free Laundry facilities are also availableThe location of this Hotel is outstanding. The Temple street Night market is only a minute or two's walk away, Mongkok and the ladies market are only a short walk too. For those that can live without a big hotel room, and prefer great facilities and location, stay here!

<Content>Sensible accommodation If your prime holiday consideration is The Hotel; if you want to be pampered, spoiled and patronised; if splendour and opulence is paramount, don't stay at the Evergreen. Because this hotel will not please you. This hotel does what it says on the tin and no more, it provides decent, basic accommodation at a fair price. Slap in the middle of work-a-day Kowloon, with all its bustle, noise, smells and character, The Evergreen is a gem. Small, clean, comfortable rooms, quiet air con, a good breakfast, lovely staff, right next to the best transport system in the world, all for 拢20 per night? Come on!The next time we visit Hong Kong my wife and I won't hesitate to book in again. Well done Evergreen, may you stay Green forever!Tony and Barbara BurkeYorkshireUK

However, the beds are ridiculously hard - no give in the mattress at all. Aircon is also very very loud. We turned ours off at night, but should have just left it on, as could hear next door's/blocks aircon. If you are staying here, bring earplugs, you will need them! This place is definitely strictly to crash in after a long day out.

<Content>Huge key fob Not as well located as it seemed - it lay midway between Tsim Tsa Tsui and Mong Kok, where not much goes on. You will need to walk to the nearest MTR station (Jordan), and catch a train every time you want to go any where unfortunately, unless you want to check out Temple Street Markets.We stayed in a room in the middle of the fourth floor, where there were no windows, so we had no idea what the weather was like outside. The lifts only went up to the third floor, so we needed to climb an extra flight of stairs each times... imagine carrying your luggage up stairs!The room was spacious for three people though, and was clean. The beds were firm, and we had no issues with the bathroom. Good value compared to other more expensive places such as the Stanford Hillview Hotel.We had free internet access, which was cool, although the machines may have been loaded with spyware, keyloggers, and viruses. The free breakfast was very ordinary, and the breakfast room was so tiny, that we often had to share tables with other guests (each table sat 3-4 people). Use of the laundry room was free.The staff was very polite and quiet and was helpful when possible. Almost all of them had only basic English skills though. Housekeeping was really polite by clearing the way whenever you needed to pass them through the narrow corridors.The worst thing about staying here was the size of the key fob attached to the room key! Shaped to look like an Evergreen tree, it was the size of an open hand. Luckily, one of us always had baggy pockets or a bag with us. We tried removing the key from the key ring, but it was soldered closed.Overall, I would stay here again, simply because of its good value. It's not a 3 or 4 star hotel, but it was cosy and very adequate. I would recommend this hotel for most travellers.

<Content>Great low-budget, no frills hotel I stayed here for a span of about 5 days in Sept 2005, and my travel partner and I basically used it as a place to sleep. It's in a great location and very conveniently located near 7/11's (there were 5 of them within a few blocks!). Given the price, location, free internet, laundry (although we didn't really use it much), nice staff, basic necessities, I thought it was very good. If you're not into frills, and looking for a good, low-budget place, I would recommend this location.

<Content>First time in Hong kong I stayed with this hotel for 3 nights. We visited Hong kong purely for vacation. We were not expecting much on this hotel considering the price range it belongs. One of my disappointment is their tv which only has 5 channels with only 1 english channels. Their elevator is only up to the 3rd floor and you have to take the stairs to the next floor. Their room is very small and their bed is also hard. Their upside is their breakfast buffet with lots of chinese foods in display. Their free internet is also very helpful especially when checking the weather and the locations and informations for the places you wish to visit. The staff are also very friendly and even though handicapped with the english language, they will try to communicate with their clients. This hotel is recommended for budget conscious and would only use the hotel just a place to sleep.

<Content>Budget Hotel, Good Location Travelled to Hong Kong (Feb 2006) for the first time with my wife and 3 children (11,8 and 4). Booked the Evergeen Hotel based on the the reviews we read on Trip Advisor(In reality was disapointed with the hotel) This was the only hotel we found that would accomodate all 5 of us in one room. Other hotels required us to book two rooms. Found this to be the general case in the far East.Hotel location is ideal. Close to the Temple street night market. Other night markets easily reachable by MRT. Jordan MRT station within walking distance of the hotel. Also several restaurants located nearby both local and burger type restaurants. This is useful if you have children as they would only eat burgers and fries. There was also a good bakery close to the hotel. Loads of 7/11 corner stores useful for snacks and drinks.Was disappointed with the hotel. In general the staff were friendly and helpful most of the time. Breakfast was included, however would not recommend it except for the toast and coffee. They served cold baked beans. When requested to have the beans warmed up. The reply was  do not have a microwave you can go next door to the 7/11 and use their microwave The room was small and cramped without a window, was fairly clean however on the second day on entering the room found a fairly large ugly cockroach. Complained to reception. The night bell boy came up removed the cockroach and explained that it must have come through the fire exit. Found that hard to believe as we were on the 4th Floor.Also found cigarette smoke being blown through the air conditioning vents even though we were in a non smoking floor.

<Content>great budget hotel i just stayed there. it is definitely not a fancy hotel, it's a budget hotel. but it is great value for the money. clean, adequate rooms, FREE INTERNET, free laundry. i did have a problem with the laundry though. after washing my clothes, i put them in the dryer for many hours before i realized that it was completely broken. my clothes still soaking wet. both dryers were totally broken, i mean didnt work at all, and there was no sign. so i had to lug my wet clothes down the street and pay someone to dry them $13 US. i'm sure they will fix this ( i would hope). the other downside is the AWFUL breakfast, but there are plenty of nearby places to eat. the location is good, but not great. about a 7 minute walk to the MTR. the best thing about it for me was the price and the free internet.

<Content>Excellent Budget Accommodation in HK I've just come back from a stay at the Evergreen Hotel in Hong Kong and I had a fantastic stay. I've stayed in another Kowloon Mid-range hotel before (the Dorsett Garden around the start of '03) but this was way more superior. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were great - clean, spacious (for Hong Kong) and comfortable. We got a good deal on their internet site with breakfast included (which was interesting to say the least!).The location is a short walk away from the Jordon MRT station which was handy. The hotel had heaps of cheap restaurants and food around, and the Temple St Night Market was very very close.This place is highly recommended for those on a budget.
