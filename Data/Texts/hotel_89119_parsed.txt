<Content>Prytania Park a great find! We decided to go to New Orleans for New Year's and to watch the Sugar Bowl. We booked on Priceline, so we didn't choose Prytania Park - it was chosen for us.What a fortunate find for us!This was the first time we stayed anywhere but the French Quarter; we were very pleased with Prytania Park's location, which is kind of 'lower garden district'... it was very convenient to the St. Charles streetcar, which was great because we flew in and didn't have our own transportation. There were several great restaurants within walking distance -- everything from fast food (wendy's, burger king) to pizza, bbq, sushi... and Emeril's Delmonico was just a block or two away (yum!!!). We rode the streetcar to the French Quarter, River Walk, the Superdome, and through the garden district to Audubon Park. We also walked a lot, which is our preference when visiting somewhere...The hotel is quaint, and felt very 'New Orleans'. Our more highbrow friends probably wouldn't have liked it -- you know, the ones that prefer four-star accomodations and amenities -- but for us, it was exactly what we were hoping for. It's a small establishment, with winding courtyards; the room we stayed in was not large but had very high, old-fashioned ceilings; the microwave and minifridge were not the newest but worked just fine for us! The room was clean, and the service staff was very friendly and helpful. The bed (matress) was one of the more comfortable ones I've encountered in a hotel! The continental breakfast was perfect for us -- cereal, yogurt, and some sort of pastry every morning, plus milk, juice and coffee.Bottom line -- if you are a picky, pampered traveler and want the most plush and up-to-date amenities, go somewhere like the 'W' and spend a few hundred dollars per night. But if you want a nice, regional establishment with a lot of charm and boatloads of convenience, and all at a really reasonable (for the location) price, this is a great place. Now that we've found it, and have discovered all the advantages of staying in that location, we will definitely be back!

<Content>Great Value Stayed here recently. Staff was very friendly and helpful in providing great restaurant recommendations and advice on getting around the city. The room was a bit small as was the bed but it was clean and comfortable. The hotel is located near the St. Charles Street trolley as well as several restaurants. It is not in a dangerous area as I walked around late at night and did not feel unsafe at all. Do know that they will ask for a credit card for incidental purchases once you check in. $50 was deducted I believe as a security deposit. As long as you're clean, don't break anything, and are generally respectful, that will be credited back towards your credit card (it took 2 or so business days). I would stay there again the next time I'm back at New Orleans.

<Content>You can't go back - beware As the saying goes you can't go back and we found out the hard way. My family booked two rooms at the hotel on my recommendation. We last stayed there 8 years ago and it was a pleasant time. However this year was quite different. The rooms were filthy - mold in tub, holes in walls presumably where a phone jack belonged, the mattress woke you up everytime you turned over and the outside area was unkept. The noise level was ridiculous. There seems to be a different clintele now staying at the hotel. The breakfast is a joke - toast and yogurt!! There was no coffee availabe and their snack area was a disgrace. After suffering through the night, we decided to leave and since it was before 11 o'clock, we thought there would be no problems. Wrong - the staff, who was quite rude, informed us that we would have to pay for the entire stay of 4 nights since we had booked in September. We told her that rule is not stated in their brochure, website or the confirmation we received. She stated it was a company policy and it didn't have to be stated. We agreed to pay for the one night but would not pay for anymore and we stated such on our bill which would be sent to our credit card company. The attitude of the staff was totally unprofessional and just rude. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. What was once a charming little hotel has become a nightmare.

<Content>European Charm The Prytania Park Hotel is, as advertized, a replica of a small european hotel. Altough it does not have the amenities of a large modern hotel, it has amenities not found in small european hotels, such as Cable TV, refrigerator and a microwave oven. Located on a side street in the Garden District and surrounded by a wall, with an innercourt yard, the hustle and bustle of a busy city seems far away. It is only a few blocks off Business 90 and has a large, off street, free, lighted and secure parling lot. It does not have a dining room, but the St.Charles Street street car line, located a half a block away, puts you within walking distance of just about anyplace you want to go.Oh yes. WEpaid $89.00 a night. The rate at a nearby Hampton Inn was $160.00 a night.

<Content>Small Room, Great Value My wife and I had trouble finding an affordable room in New Orleans in later October 08. We didn't realize that the Voodoo Music Fest was going on and the fans had most places of lodging booked. Fortunately, the Prytania had a room for the weekend which we booked, not knowing exactly what to expect.  The location is wonderful. It's one block off the St. Charles streetcar line which provided a great way to get pretty much anywhere a visitor to N.O. would want to go. The room was very small but charming in its own way. It had southern yellow pine floors, a comfortable bed, and the other standard stuff like a tv, etc. The area is also quiet. You don't hear a lot of street noise.  The Prytania probably has other rooms that are larger and more expensive. We just got what was available and were happy about that. The staff at the desk were helpful. One morning I came down for breakfast right at 9am, and the staff had just put the food away. The woman asked me if I would like something to eat and brought out some pastry and oatmeal for me. She really wouldn't have had to do that. The continental breakfast isn't much, but there are plenty of places to eat in N.O. If, like us, you need a basic, clean, safe room in which to sleep while spending the day exploring the city, this is a great place. If you plan to hang out in the room, make sure you get one of their larger ones.

<Content>Love the place This hotel is great, althought the room I stayed in was a little small, it didn't , matter as I wasn't in it much. the bed was very high and gave a nice sense of security when sleeping. I though the Kitchen/bathroom arrangment was a bit odd, (A microwave and a kettle next to the bathroom sink). The staff at the front desk were very good at ordering me a taxi early in the morning and when I needed an ironing board and iron. The only down point was the breakfast that I had to juggle out of the door to eat in the courtyard.

<Content>Don't trust your Credit Card to these Crooks!! Management at this awful Hotel engages in questionable business practices in reference to the credit cards left on file for incidental expenses. Please read!As a seasoned traveler i always prepay my reservations thru hotwire, priceline, etc. Using my regularly used visa card. However; when i check into a hotel i always insist on leaving a cash deposit or provide an imprint of a prepaid credit card with minimum fund.. This is why!!My biggest complaint about this hotel is the extremely small twin size beds that were in our room. As me and my husband were traveling together it was very unromantic and uncomfortable squeezing into a bed designed for a 6 year old. When we asked to be moved into a king, they requested a upgrade fee more than half of what we payed for the room on hotwire! After a horrible nights sleep in our barbie size bed we were awaken by a phone call from the front desk demanding payment for supposedly damaged linens removed by housekeeping the day before. Their complaint is that the linens were ruined by makeup, and they attempted to charge my credit card $100.00, but it was declined. Well thank god for that! First of all! I only wear compressed powder! Every woman knows that powder comes out of anything with a very minimum amount of warm water. If their commercial washing machines and detergents cant remove a simple powder makeup stain. Then everyone should be concerned about the cleanliness of the linens at this hotel. Second of all! How dare you attempt to charge my credit card $100.00 with out my knowledge. Especially while im still at the hotel. I went upfront to inspect the linens and i was told they were with housekeeping and they were rewashing them and i was never allowed to see the linens!Buyer beware; their occupancy was very low during my stay. It appears management tries to compensate their lack of business by taking advantage of unsuspecting guest. They will find or even makeup any excuse to charge your credit card extras.Never trust your credit card, especially a debit card to a no name family run hotel like Prytania park. Im not the only guest who had a very similar complaint. Read the reviews.

<Content>some good and some bad We stayed here in November of 07 and the place was basically fine. It is of course old...New Orleans is old...exactly what I expected. I liked the individual front doors. We were on the ground floor....room had lovely high ceilings...bathroom was in need of a little updating.Problem with our stay is that we paid $300 for a $70 room because of a convention being in town. We felt enormousely ripped off on that count and the other bothering thing is that the carpet was dark...to hide dirt I believe or maybe mold...who knows. When I walked around the room with no shoes, the bottom of my feet became black. We brought the security guard back to show him and he agreed....We also talked to people at the front desk...no one really seemed to care.The front desk peopel were very nice until we lodged our complaint about the potential mold on the carpet.I'm glad they have now done an update and have wood floors in many rooms. Aside from the cost and the carpet...the facility (our room) was great.

<Content>My kind of place! I had a great stay at this hotel. The staff, from the booking clerk, to check in and the owner/manager was great. The room was clean and serviced when I checked in and daily while I stayed for two nights. Parking was FREE and I was allowed to leave my car in the parking lot while we were on a five day cruise, also FREE. Try and find that in New Orleans. The room, by the way, was one of the low-end rooms, but was large, with high ceilings and good sized bathroom. And the A/C worked great. Throw in the price and location it makes the a place to which I will return.

<Content>Wonderful staff; charming European ambiance A lovely boutique hotel with a wonderful staff. I lost an earring of great importance and believed it was in the room. I called the hotel and they looked for me with great care. They went to extremes to help me. I cannot brag about these people enough. Granted, its intimate nature may take some people by surprise when they exit their room only to discover a stranger sipping morning coffee right outside their door. There are people (evidently the negative posters here) who expect every travel experience to be as vanilla as a Holiday Inn. Prytania Park is a gem set into a niche of New Orleans you won't know is there unless you look. If the negatives posted here reflect your travel tastes then you are better off at the Days Inn, but if you enjoy the flavor of a city like New Orleans, then definitely give this little place a try. We will be back. We enjoyed our stay immensely.

<Content>Upscale Hostel - No "boutique" hotel I reserved through Hotwire, and was expecting a 3star boutique hotel in New Orleans - get the picture?? This is more of an upscale hostel, period. The next door buildings and empty lots give the property a terrible aspect, not to mention that they don't face the street. The layout plan of the hotel, although open, could be disturbing as people walk frequently in front of your rooms ... all windows face the open hallways. The free breakfast in the lobby was just a table, with no space to sit and very few options. I don't know who gave the star rating to this place, this person should go back to training !! Beds were small, sheets and bedding were not new, bathrooms were too small and old looking, although everything was very clean.The place is nice, for an upscale hostel, friendly people, most guests are young people, many Europeans. One block away is St. Charles Avenue, which is a whole new different world, convenient to the street cars. I wouldn't stay here for the full-rate, no way! With discount, I might again.

<Content>Be Sure To Check Out Your Room Before You Leave With The Owner/Manager!!!!! Our credit card was charged $100.00 for a supposedly cold wet spot on the carpet WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE after we checked out. We did have an ice chest that had no drainage outlet - but it was completely empty!!!! and left in the bathroom.......the night clerk could verify this........ the manager/owner has decided that we are not telling the truth because we are college students and she has one herself. All we can say it that in spite of the fact that the window air condition leaked all over our clothes that were on top of a suitcase - we left the room WITHOUT a large cold wet spot. The manager/owner said that this spot was discovered when the next guests were arriving and then she said it was discovered when the maids called her to ask her what this spot was on the floor - so what was the time lapse????For a hotel to charge $100.00 for a large cold wet spot on the floor - not knowing who put it there - just assuming - and not even giving us the courtesy of letting us know that we are not only being accused - but charged - tells us that this place is one we will tell everyone about - and NOT only other college students!!! PLEASE READ THE OTHER REVIEWS - THEY SAY ALOT!!!!

<Content>Terrible - I cannot believe they are still in business I recently booked this hotel through Hotwire. This hotel should NOT be classified as a 3 star hotel. We arrived at the property about 8:30-9:00pm, and there was no indication that the hotel was even open. There were no cars in the parking lot, and no exterior lighting. There was a light on in the reception area and there was a security guard sitting in one of two chairs in the 鈥渓obby.鈥?I went in to see if the hotel was open, and he said yes, but that the Reception had gone, and left an envelope with a key for the people who 鈥渂ooked online.鈥?He said there should be someone coming back to work later in the evening. The area near the hotel is intimidating, and all the rooms are accessed from the outside, so I asked the guard to accompany us to our room. It was on the 2nd floor, and at the opposite end of the property from the reception. We saw no sign of any elevator and the guard did not indicate that there was one, so we climbed the stairs. Our Room: The A/C had not been on, so the room was extremely hot. We turned it on, and took cold showers waiting for the room to cool. It never did. Other than that, the room was not clean, there were stains on the top sheet and there was no remote control for the TV. Our Bathroom: The tub was dirty, and there were only 2 thin bath towels available, which meant we had to use the same damp towels again in the morning as we showered for the work day. I called the reception twice to see if we could change our room, get more towels, or get a remote for the TV. Nobody answered. Nobody came back to 鈥渨ork.鈥?If I had not already paid for the room through HOTWIRE, I would not have stayed. We put a chair against the door for security and decided to hold out until morning. We checked out at 7:00 am. There was a man at the reception, but he did not know why there was nobody there for the evening shift. He also suggested that they had a problem with theft when I asked about having remote controls for the TVs. I asked if we were the only guests at the hotel, and he said that there was one other reservation for that night. (I doubt they stayed, if they came in at all.)Had I known the condition of the property, I would not have stayed here at any price. The property is described as a 3 star hotel, which implies at least the minimum amount of service, amenities; even 1 employee on site would have been appreciated. If I were a single woman traveling here, I would not have even gotten out of the car. Rather than risk it on hotwire again, I booked the next night directly with the Sheraton Hotel and Towers, on Canal St., in New Orleans. This would be a 4 star property (at least) by any standard, and they gave me over 65% off the rack rate; it only cost me $10 more than what I paid Hotwire to stay in that dump.

<Content>horrible hotel experience This was the worst hotel experience of my life. When we arrived at our room, which looked nothing like the pictures and what we expected, there was trash all over the room, half-eaten food and drink, and the beds sheets had obviously been slept in. There was also exposed electrical wiring around the ceiling fan and smoke detector. The shower did not work, and to top it off, the hotel staff was outrightly rude, mean and negligent from the minute we attempted to make a reservation. The supposedly gated and secure parking lot, that they charged us for, was gated with plastic netting and guarded only half the time. In addition, we were guarranteed a certain price for a room, and later they informed us of over $100 of charges per night that they neglected to mention before we reserved the room. As a final insult they we arrived home from our stay at Pyrtania Park Hotel and found another $30 that was charged to our bank account without our knowledge, to which the hotel general manager refuses to give an explaination for. I strongly reccomend against this hotel.

Ok in fairness it was very very hot when i visited new orleans but a freind and I got into our room and it was split level.one bedroom downstairs with kitchenette.bathroom and then a spiral staircase upstairs.Went upstairs to look but the heat was unbearable despite aircon downstairs so deceided to sleep downstairs.Room was quite cramped with 2 people and suitcases and hard to carry luggage up several flights of stairs.The location was not that great either-had to bus to get anywhere but the good news was the hosts were excellent and nothing was too much trouble.

<Content>a slum at best... We recently stayed at this hotel for mardi gras. it was god awful. leading up to our stay, we were contacted and asked if we were still coming and that even if we were, there were no rooms....??? the following day, we were contacted again and told that this was a mistake and that the owner said that we could stay...??? once we arrived, what a mess! our room was not clean. they then tried to move us to some slum apartments across the street next to housing projects with several gang people walking around. we were frightened. we refused to accept this abandoned building as our mardi gras getaway and insisted on our prepaid suite. well, they finally said that a mistake had happened that our room was ready after all of our fussing and demanding what we had paid for. when given the keys to our room, we found it had no linen, no towels, the room was still dirty from the previous guest. we went downstairs and complained and were told that housekeeping was gone for the day and that we could clean our own room. thank god for the security guard, he was willing to help us. once our room was cleaned, we left for dinner. when we returned the power was off at the hotel. it remained this way until 11pm. the following morning, we had no hot water. we were told by the staff that the water situation had been this way for over 2 days. we insisted on speaking to the owner. an old senile woman showed up later the next day and just rambled on about how hard she works and what a great job she does as a builder. we were so perplexed, we let the situation go. once we asked the desk who the crazy woman was, he said oh yes, that's the owner. see what we deal with. we will never be back to this hotel again. we are insisting that we receive a refund and have reported this situation to the better business bureau.

<Content>Terrible Stayed at this Hotel in the not too distant past. All those who call this hotel a positive experience are truly out of their minds. The hotel was terrible. The bathroom was dirty and stank. The rugs were old and dilapidated. The mirror was cracked. The walls were thin and the sex-sounds of the couple in the adjoining room were clearly heard. The water was neither hot nor cold. The paint in the rooms was at least a decade old and was peeling. The guest crowd was full of people with an average of 11 tattoos on various parts of their bodies.The people at the front desk were helpful when they were available. The neighbourhood of the hotel was of underworld thugs and it was as scary to navigate those streets as downtown Detroit.I will never ever stay at this Hotel again. I beg all of you not to consider this hotel even as the remotest possibility. I think hurricane Katrina, however bad, was an inevitable mechanism of Mother Nature to get rid of such filthy hotels from New Orleans and allow its rejuvenation.Again, DO NOT fall for the web site cheating. STAY OFF this place.

<Content>Awesome hotel in the heart of New Orleans This was an excellent hotel. The price was just perfect and we thouroughly enjoyed our stay. The owner's of the hotel are always within reach and that is saying something for a hotel these days. My husband and I stayed for our 4 year anniversary and I plan to return for a baby shower in New Orleans Labor Day weekend and look forward to another visit to the Prytania. We only hope to get to stay in a loft room this time as there are a couple more in our party. What a pleasant stay and the rooms are absolutely adorable. The old-world charm and stmosphere is abosuletly wonderful. I am glad we got to experience this hotel and hope to make it a tradition upon upcoming visits to New Orleans.

<Content>great rooms and lots of good places to eat I stayed at the Prytania Park Hotel for the second time in 6 months. We have relatives in the city who recomend the Prytania. What a wonderful stay. The hotel is a simple hotel set in the Garden District less than a block from a street car stop. They have wonderful restaurants just a few blocks away. My wife and I decided to go to Bravo's on this trip. What a fantastic meal. We were able to walk there in less than 5 minutes and it was probably one of the best meals of our lives. No kidding. We had wonderful steaks, a fantastic lobster bisque and a creme brulee to die for. We got out for less than $55.00 without drinks. We also ate at Voodoo Barbeque and it was great. Have the pulled pork, corn pudding and chocolate cake. Delicious. It was less than a block from Prytania Park. I had to attend to business while in New Orleans, and I had left my laptop at the airport. The great front desk clerk, made multiple calls to the airport and found my laptop which was delivered before my meeting. A clean comfortable room with attentive staff. We can't wait to return.

<Content>Prytania Park is great, swamp tour rules. My wife and I checked in after horrible delays at 2 different airports. New Orleans was our last stop on a 7 mth vacation. When we checked in we were greeted by a friendly and knowledgable staff. We checked into a wonderful two level loft room which had great space for our daughters who are attending school in New Orleans. We were thrilled with the price. Just $99.00 for a weekend night! Downtown hotels were $180.00 and up for the same nights! The room was both clean and inviting. The continental breakfast on the first morning was simple yet high quality. We ate outside in the wonderful courtyard which we just loved. On our second morning we went to the Blue Plate Cafe which was only a block away. What a delcious breakfast. It was one of the best breakfasts of our entire stay. One of the front desk agents also suggested Copeland's Cheesecake Bistro. We had serious complaints about that place. It was just too much delicious cajun food! Many other restaurants were also just an easy walk away. We picked up the streetcar just a block away and took it to Bourbon Street. The wonderful front desk staff also suggested the Cajun Pride Swamp tour. That was the best time. Drinking a daiquiri and watching gators. We had never seen a gator before except on a belt. Would we recomend the Prytania? Absolutely! Wonderful staff, clean rooms and good location. We enjoyed it so much my daughter is now planning her wedding at the Queen Anne mansion which the hotel also owns. A wonderful memorable stay.

<Content>A Terrible Disappointment We found the Prytania from the web on Hotels.com. The photos on the web showed a quaint and authentic New Orleans style hotel - just what I was looking to stay in for my first time to the city. My husband and I arrived with our two small children shortly after midnight. Driving up to the hotel, the surrounding area was a bit ominous. I thought we were staying in the Garden District? I guess they meant 鈥渁lmost鈥?in the Garden District. We checked in and went up to our room exhausted from our long drive and ready to retire. Being so late we requested a different room. Although this one was cleaner than the first, it was still unacceptable. You say my standards are high? Well maybe, but let me just mention a few things I noticed and you be the judge. 1. Thick dust collected on the curtains 2. Wallpaper peeling off the walls. 3. Water stains on the ceiling. 4. Hairs on the floor in the bathroom. 5. The loft bedding was soiled with stains on the inner blanket and what I can only describe as dried up goop on the sheets. (I always pull back sheets to check for stains and bed bugs 鈥?Thank God I did) 6. I killed to small baby roaches in the bathroom/kitchen area (the dormitory size refrigerator and coffee maker are behind the bathroom door). Note: The room was cramped with all the furniture and if you are on the heavy side do not request the loft room. The spiral stairs are quite narrow even for someone of average weight and height.Needless to say we did not fulfill our stay at the Prytania Park and decided to go with a reputable local chain 鈥?Marriott 鈥?for the rest of our stay in the city.Although, I will say this hotel has potential. If they would only keep it up and clean, it would lend itself to being exactly what I was looking for, quaint and authentic.

<Content>A Lot of Bang for your Buck! We just returned from a two night stay at the Prytania Park Hotel. We got a terrific rate by booking directly with the hotel using the Summer Sizzle discount. We had a loft room with two queen sized beds offering some privacy for more than one traveler. The hotel staff was wonderful. They allowed us to check in early and, in order to accommodate our late flight, leave our bags after checking out. Housekeeping was excellent. A light continental breakfast is served each morning. The hotel is right off the St. Charles streetcar line and very convenient for getting around without a car. On our next trip to New Orleans we would definitely stay at the Prytania Park again.

<Content>Good value in lower Garden District Rooms are small and housekeeping a B-, but the location is great, right on streetcar line, and (despite other reviews) good restaurants nearby. great gumbo at St. Charles Tavern, Emeril's Delmonico, Copelands's, La Madelines, all within 4 blocks. Free parking in guarded lot! Continental breakfast is minimal, but got a mini-suite (read microwave  small fridge) for $59 by booking directly with the hotel! Hard to beat when compared to French Quarter or Warehouse district. Staff very good with directions  advice. Certainly not elegant, but a bargain none-the-less.

<Content>Hauntingly Beautiful My mother and I stayed at the Prytania Park Hotel and we had an unforgettable time. The hotel had only one room available yet we never saw any other people other than the cleaning ladies and staff in the front office. Our room was truly private (3-4 flights of spiral staircases up...What a workout!!)...the room looked like the inside of a dollhouse...it almost felt creepy but beautiful...very New Orleans like...the walls were painted pink with all sorts of Victorian scenes...so so feminine...our bathroom was very spacious with a very clean bathtub, floors, and sink. We also had a huge wooden closet...I would truly recommend this hotel for someone who is on a budget yet wants to experience New Orleans as it should be

<Content>Okay to stay if other options not available First visit to NO during a very busy convention so available hotels were hard to come by. I booked online through expedia and thought I secured a suite at the hotel. Upon checkin I was advised that there were no longer suites available (I did PAY IN ADVANCE through expedia) and I would have to take a standard room. It was late and after a 10 hour trip I took what I could get. The rooms are small!!! The kitchen is a very old microwave and a bar fridge. The bathroom is very small as well. The room did appear to be quite clean but the first morning I decided to do a clean test - they give you a card that says if you want the sheets changed put it on the bed. I marked the bottom of the sheet and one of my pillows very lightly with an eyeliner (something that would wash out very easily) and put the card on the middle of the bed in obvious view. That evening when I returned I checked my markings and they were still there!!! The bed was made but the sheets/pillows NOT washed.The hotel is not in a bad location - very close to St. Charles street and I walked in every morning to the convention centre - an easy 20 minute walk. As for bourbon street it was only about a $10 or so cab ride away. The hotel staff were good and seemed helpful. If other hotels are available I would chose them over the Prytania, however, for the price it's okay.

<Content>Perfect for the price No complaints here. The rooms were quaint and clean. The staff was friendly and very accomadating. My only complaint was breakfast wasnt served on time saturday. We were located alittle further from downtown than I would have liked but the hotel was nice. The cleaning crew was honest because I accidentally left my purse loaded with money out and not one thing was removed from it. I was very pleased with this hotel and its staff.

<Content>Small isn't always beautiful Recently stayed here and although it's handy to several eateries and the St Charles streetcar I found the room a little on the small side. The rooms are built in a courtyard and there's not a lot of natural light on the ground level.There is a small outside seating area which is pleasant.Staff were O.K. but I'm not sure I'd want to go back. Quite expensive for what you get.

<Content>Good overall, despite a few problems We stayed at the Prytania Park for 3 nights over spring break weekend. We made reservations through Orbitz for a historic room, but on check-in, were told that all they had available was one of their contemporary rooms. From the pictures i had seen on the web, I knew the contemporary ones did not seem as quaint. Since we had no other options (the hotel was sold out that night), we took the contemporary room (room 137). The location of the room was good (not in high traffic area), but the first night we woke up repeatedly since we could hear the upstairs guests walking around at all hours. They weren't being noisy, its just the floors creaked loudly. We talked to the front desk about switching rooms, but again, since they were sold out, they didn't have anything else to offer. My advice - be sure you get a second floor room, since I would imagine this is a widespread problem. The front desk offered to have security talk to the room upstairs, but we told them not to worry about it - what would they have said...stop walking around? Otherwise, we found the location to be really convenient for us. Easy access to the trolley, good restaurants in walking distance, near the cruise terminal and convention center, etc. The area seemed relatively safe, but it is not in the garden district...its about 6 blocks from there despite what they might say. The continental breakfast was ok, nothing great, so we didn't make the effort to get up for it, except on the first morning there. We found the staff to be helpful and friendly. Our smoke alarm went off for some unexplained reason one afternoon, and the staff was there to replace it within about 3 minutes. Parking was easy and free. The security guard kept an eye on the parking lot after dark. Overall, I would say it was good, but be sure to reserve a second floor room.

<Content>One night too long!! Good location?...no!Friendly?...no!Welcoming?...no!Professional?...no!Would I return?...no!But it was cheap.Moral of the story is that if you want want good service in a good location, in a place you would want to return, choose a Marriott. For anything else...choose Prytania Park

<Content>Not bad for the $$$..... Just got back from New Orleans yesterday and stayed 5 nights at this hotel. Purchased on Hotwire for about $60/night, which was about what it was worth. When we first arrived we couldn't decide if it was charming or a dump. Yes, there was peeling wallpaper, burn marks on the blankets in our non-smoking room and a microwave circa. 1983, however it didn't smell and we finally decided that the room was decent, especially for the price. The close quarters make for a lot of outdoor noise with people coming and going all-hours of the night. Here are some tips/recommendations to make sure you have a plesant stay:1. Call ahead (like 2-3 weeks) to request a particular room. I called 2+ weeks in advance to reserve a room with two double beds. We did end up with a loft-style room, which worked out well. I was given a confirmation number when I called to request, so make sure to ask for one!2. Request a quiet room AWAY from the ice machine and the area where they set up for their breakfast. It was VERY noisy around 7:15am when they were gettting ice and putting up tables for the breakfast crowd. I would suggest something toward the backside of the building. (and bring earplugs, just in case.....especially if you're a light sleeper!)3. Don't plan on eating anything worthwhile at the continental breakfast. It's pretty worthless. However there are a few places 1-2 blocks away that serve breakfast (Le Madeline, Wendy's, Dunkin Donuts, etc.)4. We did NOT have to pay for parking in their lot! There is quite a bit of on-street parking anyway....not a big deal.5. The location was great! It is NOT a bad neighborhood at all! It is 1/2 a block from St. Charles and 1 block from the streetcar stop. Emril's Delmonico restaurant is 2 blocks away....and there are several other restaurants nearby as well. There is also a Walgreen's 2 blocks away.6. The staff preformed their duties. They definitely didn't bend over backwards for us, but were plesant in the few time we dealt with them.Go with few expectations and you will enjoy this hotel. For the price, and with what I know now, I would definitely stay here again. However, just remember....it ain't the Ritz! :-)

<Content>A nice budget hotel for a budget price We had a nice four day stay at the Prytania during Mardis Gras. When we arrived at the hotel, a couple was having an animated conversation with the front desk staff. I overheard them mention better business bureau and were not at all happy. I am not certain what the problem was, but our stay was relatively problem free. The room was OK, actually pretty good for the price. The rooms were not well insulated for sound, but turning on the bathroom fan helped muffle things. The shower had little water pressure. Bed spreads were faded and stained and wallpaper peeling. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. We appreciated the refrigerator and microwave.The front desk staff was very friendly and accomodating. The hotel is not really considered Garden District, although the neighborhood is fine. We enjoyed access to the street cars just a block away. Get an all day pass from the front desk and you don't have to hassle with exact change.The Hotel is a great spot for parade viewing just a block from St. Charles in a family friendly area. They don't have an onsite laundry room, but a few blocks away is a bar named Lucky's that is also a laundrymat. And on Thursday nights they have the added bonus of live music with no cover charge. Several nice restaurants are within walking distance.

<Content>Appreciate the amenities What a joy to be able to park for free, have a free continental breakfast and a microwave and refrigerator in our room. Apparently, they just started a Free parking program. We were also able to park our car for free while we took our awesome cruise to Mexico. We just enjoyed every aspect of the hotel, from the staff, to the location. Even the housekeeper gave us extra towels with a smile. We walked one block to a great restaurant, Bravo's. And the streetcar was easy to catch to the French Quarter. We highly recommend the Prytania Park to anyone who wants a good value in New Orleans.

<Content>Excellent Hotel for the price Our hotel stay was great. The price being under $70 was very good considering we left our car there while we cruised for free. Our room was a one bedroom suite with a loft and balcony; it was so beautiful. This hotel is in a good location, close to St. Charles street. But yet far enough away from all the noise of the street nightlife. We walked one block to several shops and to eat all our meals. The hotel's contential breakfast was good. We ate breakfast at a restaurant and snacked on the muffins and fruit while waiting to board the cruise ship. The hotel and our room was very clean. I would recommend, because the streets of New Orleans are usually one way, crowded, and narrow that you take a cab or the street car where ever you need to go. We left my car there at the hotel while on our cruise and it worked out better than had we drove to the terminal and parked. The hotel staff were wonderful and extremely nice. Don't let the old building near the hotel worry you. Prytania Park Hotel is nice and clean. Thanks Prytania Park Hotel for making our first visit to New Orleans a memorable one. We highly recommend this hotel. LittrellsHuntsville, Arkansas

<Content>Contrary to Popular Belief I had read the reviews before going to the prytania park hotel and was scared. Then when I realized that I had been charged before I showed up at the hotel and it was impossible to cancel my reservation I was really scared. But, when I showed up and got to my room, all fears were gone. I was lucky to be in one of their antique rooms. Room 103 to be exact. Really nice for the price. Great big room, comfortable bed and pillows, wish there was more than a shower though. The front desk staff was really helpful (and cute too!). No need to pay the $13 per night parking at this hotel though, there is plenty of free parking around the block. I would go back, but only if I had that same room, in the same part of the hotel. IT's also nicely centrally located, easy access to the street car, Magazine Street, and far enough away from the French Quarter to be restful!!!

<Content>Nice enough First, I will tell you reading the reviews I was scared to death of my reservation that I could not change. But, the experience was not bad. The room I thought was nice and quite unique. I was there for a convention and though we had to drive to the site each morning it was not bad. The one thing that I thought was inconvient was that there was no elevator. The night before we came to New Orleans I broke my foot and was quite disabled. I had two big suitcases and when we got to the hotel we were booked on the second floor. We had no problem with that until we found out there was no elevator. Still we kept our room and there was a struggle to get our suitcases upstairs. There was one staff member we saw who helped us get the last suitcase upstairs but we were on our own from there. My overall rating I would stay there again if I was healthy. Quaint room, the breakfast was supposed to be a start out your day snack, but it was gone by the time we were on our way and that was about 6:30am.

<Content>Changes This was our second time staying at Prytania and found it to be different from the first time. First time free shuttle to French Quarter, second time told to take streetcar at $1.25 per person each way and walked a couple blocks. First time free parking, second time $12.95 per night the plus state and local tax of $1.56 which we were not told about and desk clerk did not even mention it. We happened to see it on our check-in slip. Questioned desk clerk and was told they could do nothing about it. It is extremely exorbitant for the location of the hotel. I feel that I should have been told when making reservations online about this. The continental breakfast has been downgraded. In the future when I come I will consider looking elsewhere. The first time we were really impressed - the second time depressed. $12.95 a day plus tax to be added on a bill is a lot when you are not expecting it.

<Content>no so much I stayed at the Prytania Pk Sept 30 to Oct 4 and I couldn't wait to get out of there. The wallpaper was peeling, hair in the bathroom and on my sheets, and the pillows were HORRIBLE. I peeked under my pillow case and all the other pillows in the room, looking for a clean one. The pillows were stained - they were GROSS. No pillow covers or double pillow cases, just one pillow case covering nasty stains. If I hadn't pre-paid I would have left.Most of the staff was very nice and the good thing was the room did not smell musty (critical in a humid climate). This has to be a 2 star hotel at the most.

<Content>Gem in the Garden District. Just got back from a lovely stay at the Prytania Park Hotel. The room was like a semi-suite with two queen beds, one was up a spiral staircase to a loft. Breakfast was just enough to get us on our way to the streetcar which is quite convenient. The hotel is close to Commander's Palace where we had a fantastic ($$$) dinner one night. We were able to walk to Emeril's Delmonicos restaurant for a great brunch ($$$$), which was just around the corner from the hotel. The staff was great, especially Paul the evening person. We almost felt like we were in a BB as we got to know most of the staff. It's not in the French Quarter, but we were able to go there and get back easily on the streetcar and with cabs. We discovered the Garden District and now will stay there everytime we go back.

<Content>A romantic weekend ruined! The staff was terribly rude and disrespectful! The room was nice enough, but the problems FAR outweighed the pleasures. The thermastat was set on about 80 on a mid-summer's day. It's the SOUTH! It's HOT! The refridgerator was also turned off, and the little tray under the freezer section was full of water. The fridge didn't even get cool until the next morning. Why turn it off if you know there will be guests in that room? Very unthoughtful, if you ask me. I do admit that the room was clean. The bathroom was a little dirty, hair and dirt in the corners. Upon expressing our concerns the next day, they said that they couldn't do anything to compensate, because we reserved our room on-line. I ALWAYS reserve online and I NEVER get that kind of terrible service. Overall, the Prytania Park Hotel has not earned my respect and I will never stay there again.

<Content>excellent!!!!! I was a little apprehensive about staying at the Prytania due to the previous reviews that I had read. I was more than pleasantly surprised upon check in. Due to my close proximity to New Orleans we have stayed there on numerous occasions usually paying 159.00 per night for accomodations similar to the Prytania. I am delighted that I have found The Place!!! I will book a room here from now on. I plan on staying here quite a bit since I have a new college student in New Orleans. The staff could not have been more pleasant and the rooms were very very nice.

<Content>Quaint, clean, but inconvenient I would advise all using the internet to locate Hotel accomodations to call the hotel to verify information posted by websites. A link from A-1 Discount Travel stated that the street car was free in the Garden District, which is where the Prytania Park Hotel is located. Not True. Also, stated that parking was free. Not True. The Hotel itself was fine. However, the Continental breakfast was a joke. And it is a big hassle having to catch the street car  have correct change, etc. if you are going to French Quarter, etc. I will not stay here again.

<Content>The hotel form Hell! All I can say is that I would recommend this place to only two people....my ex-wife, and her mother!!The management and staff are rude and indifferent to the problems and concerns that we raised during our stay, and they make you feel small and stupid, for daring to complain. This place has issues - both physical and in service delivery.The GM (at least that's what he said his title was), was unpleasant at best and obnoxious at the very least. Strange, that by reading (the genuine) comments left on this site by other visitors to Prytania Park, it would appear he has a history. Even stranger is that he has the full support of the ownership? Does that mean that the ownership like the way he handles complaints...if so, that's very worrying, in our service driven economy.I have nothing good to say about this place, other than my ex-wife and her mother would feel at home...enough said!

<Content>Would definitely stay here again! After reading the tripadvisor reviews prior to staying at the Prytania this July, I was pretty nervous about what I would find. It's obviously some people just are plain fussy, snobby or just like to complain for the hell of it - or winge as we say her in Australia.Room was great - good comfy beds, nice and clean. Location was fabulous - away from the noise of the French quarter but only a 10 min trolley/streetcar ride..... which was like a 2 min safe walk from the the hotel.Staff were fantastic - they bent over backwards to help us.... a big thanks to Chris, Montana, John, Bernard and everyone else who helped us out but who I can't remember or don't know their namesIf I ever get back to New Orleans, this is where I will be staying....Thanks for helping make my stay in New Orleans an enjoyable oneLaurel

<Content>Deplorable! Horrible, DEPLORABLE! Words cannot begin to describe the treatment my co-workers received from this hotel. I made reservations for my colleages in FEBRUARY, for arrival in JUNE. ( You'd think if there were any problems 5 months would be enough time for the hotel to let me know!) HOWEVER...as my colleagues were on the plane from Japan, just 24 hours before check-in, the Prytania dumped/cancelled 6 of the 7 of the reservations. Their excuse? Bad credit card. Not only is this not true, ( the one and only guest that had the 1 spared reservation checked in under the same credit card guarantee that was placed on all the rooms!) but I believe they never even ran the credit card at all. When I asked why they didn't call to let me know there was a problem with the credit card, the manager said That's not my job. It's your problem They never even called to let me knowthe reservations were cancelled!!! How are you supposed to know the hotel has cancelled your reservation if they don't tell you?!You are just supposed to find out when you arrive? To make a long story short, all of my co-workerswere turned out on the street becuase the Prytaniahad other guests who had made reservations at a higher rate $$. They needed 6 of our rooms, so they took them. UNBELIEVABLE!

<Content>Will definately stay again. Loved it. I just stayed at the Prytania Park Hotel last weekend and I must honestly say that from reading all of the reviews on this website, I was totally unsure of what I would discover upon check in. We had booked a room in the Queen Anne, which to my amazement was and old Victorian Mansion renovated into a second building for the Prytania 1 block from the main building. I loved it, this place has hardwood floors, huge celings, huge beds, huge bathrooms, everything about the Queen Anne was huge, except the price. This place totally reminded me of a BB, without the intimacy of a BB, which I love. For one we only paid $59 a night on a weekend in N.O! How can you complain about that rate? This is in the Garden District only a half block from St. Charles streetcar and is even walkable to the French Quarter if your not an old fogey and don't mind walking about 15-20 mins. Also about the reviews stating this place is in a bad neighborhood, what are they talking about?! People that think this is in a bad neighborhood must think that if they see a black person it is a bad neighborhood. Of course there is some nut job looking people in the neighborhood but what major city does not have a not job everywhere? Also the complaint about the packaged muffins for the continental breakfast, they were Otis Spunkmeyer muffins you picky loser. This is a hotel for less than half the cost of a BB, they dont claim to be a BB either. My advice, use the money you save by staying at the Prytania and have yourself a great dinner and one many great places to eat in N.O. I loved my stay at the Prytania Park and it was a nice change from the mundane atmosphere of a chain hotel.

<Content>Will Stay Again!! I found the Prytania Park Hotel website and used it to reserve our room. Afterwards I learned some friends had stayed there last October and were quite pleased with their stay; indeed, they also reserved a room and came with us on our trip. The location IS in the Garden District, a half-block from St. Charles, with many nice restaurants close by, one of which we walked to at 9 p.m. one evening. Our room was just fine; not huge by any means, but quite adequate with a microwave and a small fridge. The hotel staff were very pleasant, and very helpful in recommending local restaurants. I enjoyed the morning coffee and continental type breakfast provided, and found the courtyard area a nice place to relax. I will definitely stay again, and have recommended the Prytania to friends!

<Content>A charming place would stay again Just stayed here over Memorial Day weekend and had a wonderful stay. The staff was very friendly and bent over backward for us. We locked our keys on the car and they helped us try to get them out. The room was charming. It was like staying with a friend. The room was clean but not perfect. If you are looking for a Marriott that is perfect with no character this is not the place for you. The continental breakfast was weak but we weren't there for breakfast. The atmosphere was fabulous. We plan on visiting again in the fall and look forward to staying here again. We also would reccommend to friends and family.

<Content>Worst experience ever I have traveled extensively, this is by far the WORST hotel I have ever encountered. When we arrived, we thought that we were booked into their sister hotel, the Queen Anne. They did a bait and switch on the rates, so we decided to stay at the Prytania. The first room they gave us was in the process of being made up. The second room they gave us was occupied by a painter who was sanding and working on the room. Then they tried to give us the room next to that (just imagine the noise of workmen sanding while you're trying to relax). Upon check-out, they claimed that we parked in their lot, a $10 per day charge. We informed them that we had not used this service, we parked on the street our entire stay. They have refused to refund this charge even though I have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and the Lousiana Tourist Commission. They are liars and thieves. Be warned, you will be miserable and cheated if you choose to stay at this hotel

<Content>Unbelievably bad customer service I really thought it would be fine, despite the reviews. I was horribly wrong. There was a $10 charge to park every night. The desk people were hopeless...as long as they have your money, they truly don't seem to care if you have linens or light bulbs. I have been trying to reach them without success for several days now about an extra charge. Good luck speaking to someone who knows anything!! Do not stay here. The area is lovely, but the service at this hotel is crappy.
