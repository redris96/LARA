<Content>Trully Novotel This Novotel located in the very heart of Wanchai with proximity to MTR and many attractions. The Interior is smart and efficient, very well representing the Novotel brand. The staff are dressed in smart casual and pretty helpfull in many aspects. The room size is rather small like most other hotel in HK, but the layout design were very smart. Me and my wife slept together with our 2 years old daughter, I dont really recommend children older than 5 years old to share the bed with their parents, the bed is too small. Dont ever think about having an extra bed, you'll get cramped in the room, ask for a triple room instead.The Bathroom has the clever lay out , tough it is small and no tub, but it feels roomy and provided enough space to put your toiletries. Absolutely would consider to stay here again for my future HK trip

<Content>Acceptable 4-star hotel. Don't expect to be WOW. Ok, it is a Novotel (part of the Accor group), so u get drones of french tourists in this hotel. Reminds me of a modern version of European boutique hotelFree Airport Xpress Shuttle fm HK station : Every 20 minsDistance to MTR: 7 mins walk away from Wanchai MTR.Entrance : Nondescript. U can easily miss it.Front desk: Busy, busy, busy. Business-likeRoom's decor: Neutral colours and modern designSize of Room: Typical HK size. SmallBed : The bed is so HARD. This is 3-star standard.Amenities : They provide bedroom slippers. No bath-robes!Breakfast : We didn't take any. Prefer local breakfast.Wifi : Available  free. Not sure if it belongs to hotel, though.Gym : Small but sufficesConclusion: Tourist Hotel or budget business traveler's hotel. if it is going for a song  you need a bed/room for the night, this is comfortable enough.

<Content>Everything I wanted! 1st time in Hong Kong and I will be returning to Hong Kong and this hotel! My 3 night stay was everything I would have wanted. The hotel is in a great location for exploring. The hotel is well presented, clean and modern. The roof top pool was a great way of cooling down after a day sightseeing. The rooms were quite compact, but I've been in smaller! The breakfast selection was large and fresh food was always being put out. Overall I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good value for money After much looking at last minute/discout websites booked this via hotel own website as most would not let me book an extra bed for a child or wanted to charge horrenously. Put in comments section that we had a chikd but hotel had missed this still it was sorted on arrival and we had a single sofa bed for our 7 year old. Kids stay and eat brealkfast for free. We just ordered the $100HK continental which was fine. They provide 2 free bottled waters each day per rooom. Bed VERY hard - assume this is how hte Asians like them!5 min walk to nearest MTR station and 10 min walk to catch the ferry to Kowloon.Had 3 nights at hotel which rushed by as one was a 11 hour visit to Disney land - recommend it for children 6 and below our nearly 8 year old found some of the rides a bit lame his words althought he loved Space Mountain.Hope this helps.ciaoSue

<Content>Great location This hotel was recommended by a friend and I also read reviews on Trip Advisor. All my expectation were met, from the pick up Luxury Coach at the airport to final check out. The room was slightly small compared to South African 4 star hotels, but it had all the amenities you would expect incl your own iron and ironing board. The hotel is well located for travelling around Hond Kong Island and visiting nearby attractions. The food was very good and the staff were pleasant. They have an inhouse tour booking service which was great. I will recommend it to anyone looking for a 4 star hotel. We stayed in a standard room which was perfect for us because we spent most of the days walking and shopping so the room was really a sleeping place and a comfortable one I must add.

<Content>Clean comfortable well located base in HK I stayed at the Novotel for 5 nights during a business trip to Hong Kong. I was attending a conference at the Hong Kong convention centre. The novotel provided a great base for doing this, there is an elevated, covered walkway starting across the street from the hotel that takes you straight to the convention centre (10min walk) past shops, an asian supermarket, bars, restaurants and banks. The walkway also takes you to the ferry terminal where you can catch the ferry to the other side of HK harbour and the shops in Kowloon The hotel is in wanchai which seemd a safe neighbourhood, there are some shops close buy and the wanchai computer centre ( a 3 storey hive of small cellphone, computer and electronic shops) is close by if you are looking for a new gadget ( but make sure you buy from someone offering an international warranty if making a large purchase). At night parts of wanchai seem a bit seedy and there did seem to be a few undesirable bars and nightclubs open up in the evening but this is typical of any large city and didn鈥檛 really put me off the hotel or the location. We got a taxi to Soho where the restaurants and bars are a bit more trendy. (Taxis in HK are VERY cheap in the city centre) The hotel itself was clean, the staff were helpful and the room was a standard well presented Novotel style room, double room with two very comfortable single beds, flat scrren LCD TV, desk with wired broadband (no Wifi in room), clean bathroom and AC. Most of the double rooms in HK seem to consist of 2 single beds so if you want a double bed you should make sure you specify this at the time of booking. The hotel restaurant served a reasonably priced breakfast with a combination of western and asian buffet and cooked to order selections. My only real critisism was the baggage storage facility while I was waiting to checkin for my room and after checkout while waiting for the bus to the airport, which consisted of tying the left luggage together with rope and leaving them in the main foyer 鈥?this needs to be worked on. In all a good hotel and I would recommend it and I would stay there again for a business or holiday trip.

<Content>A great base in Hong Kong The Novotel Century is located in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. It is a smart,modern hotel in a great location. The staff are friendly and welcoming and the standard of guests rooms high. Considering the high cost of accomodation in Hong Kong, this makes a great base in which to explore the area if you are on holiday, but is also good for business trips too. Highly recommended

<Content>Nice stay at the Novotel Stayed for seven nights at the Novotel Century to attend a conference at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The hotel is in great proximity to the centre with a covered walkway about 5-7 mins walk from the hotel. The hotel is located in downtown WanChai amongst what I'd call the bathroom and hardware district. This is a quiet part of town between the bustle of the hostess bars on Lockhart Road and the frenzy of Causeway Bay/TImes Square.The MTR is less than 5mins walk away and trains arrive every 3-4mins til late. The Star Ferry Pier to Tsim Sha Tsui (Kowloon) is also 5mins away and only costs $2.20HK to catch acrossThe hotel itself is basic but freshly renovated with small comfortable rooms. Initially upgraded to the top/executive floor we couldn't handle the smell of smoke despite being told the room had been treated. We moved back down to the 18th non-smoking floor where we now had a harbour view... not badThe room was cleaned spotless everyday, 2 complimentary water bottles were provided each day, LCD TV and safeMy only gripe with the room was its small size, the beds are quite firm, lack of ironing facilities and the ever present slight smell of cigarette smokeThe breakfast buffet was quite good and the concierge/reception staff were always helpfulA taxi to the hotel from the airport costs around $350HKD, taxis and all transport are cheap to get around in hong kong, however u should get the staff to write dwon the hotel or other destination in cantonese for the driver because there english is fairly poorThere is also pool, gym and sauna facilities at the poolCompared with other hotels around this are the Novotel was excellent value for money costing $1100HKD/night for a partial harbour view Overall a comfortable stay and I would definitely return

<Content>Nice and modern design I stayed at the Novotel Century in Wanchai for 3 nights during a business trip. Knowing a few Novotels in Europe, I was surprised by the nice and modern design and style of the hotel.My room was on the 11th floor with a little bit of harbour view and can be described as rather small but functional and in a very good condition. Nice and clean bathroom, everything seemed quite new.Even though the hotel is located at a very busy street (are there non-busy streets in Hong Kong? ;-) ) the room was very quiet.There is a small pool as well which looked nice, but I didn't have the time to try it out. I had breakfast in the hotel once, was ok but nothing extraordinary. I would recommend to visit one of the many coffee shops right outside, there you can get a nice breakfast for almost half the price...The location was very convenient for me as it was close to the office I was visiting and you can walk to the harbour to take the famous Star Ferry over to Kowloon. In general a very nice alternative to the more luxurious harbour view hotels and definitely recommendable for a short stay (I would probably not spend a week of holiday there though).

<Content>OK but some annoying details First of all, we have to consider the new design of Novotel hotels much much better than in the past. It's simple, clear, modern and very good with flat screen TVs, very comfy bathrooms with elegant design and a good scheme of colors.About the size, it's small but reasonnable because we booked a standard room and in comparaison with HK standards, it was OK, about 20 sq meters. However, even if the room was nice, the staff of the hotel is absolutely not helpful and not smily at all. Even if you arrive with a lot of baggages, nobody will help you to bring it to your room. They don't say welcome and they don't care if they disturb you. In the morning, even if you place the sign do not disturb in front of your room, they will call you if you need they make the room. It was totally disturbing because we wanted to sleep and we have been wake up. Nobody says sorry and it's not acceptable.We can complain about the soundproofing as well which is not good at all and you'll have the impression to live with your room neighbours. Depending of the kind of customers will saty close to your room, it could be OK but it could be much more noisy as well...However, it's a good adress because the location is PERFECT, in the middle of Wanchai and the design is very interesting.But the management should train better the staff because this is a four stars hotel...

<Content>Wouldn't recommend it We booked 4 nights accommodation at the Novotel Century in Wan Chai during the month of April but was not very satisfied with the overall experience in this hotel. First of all, we made our booking a month prior to our stay and requested for non-smoking rooms. To our disbelief they gave us rooms on the smoking floor (Floor 9) which they did not apologise or try to make amends for. The room definitely smelled of cigarettes which is foul.We also paid $1400 HKD for a 'superior' double room but only to receive a room about the size of a shoe box. They were clean but absolutely tiny without enough room to put our luggages. There was cable TV but most channels were in chinese, otherwise they were business-related programs..Im sure most people would agree that having HBO or other movie channels would have been nice.Another major complaint is that the walls  doors in this hotel is paper-thin..You can hear almost every conversations taking place outside your hotel room..Nothing worse than being woken up at 7.00am because of noisy neighbours. However, the house-keeper shouting Excuse me, house-keeping at 9.00am is also inexcusable..Surely they can do it at a more reasonable time so as to allow guests on their holidays to sleep in a little!! Very frustrating as they ignore the Do not disturb sign.The location was good as it was almost midway between Causeway Bay and Central. The hotel is also situated next to the ferry terminal which allows you to take the Star Ferry to Kowloon. Overall though, we felt that the hotel room was over-priced and iwhen you include the other disadvantages such as noise levels, inappropriate timing of house-keeping, absolutely tiny size of rooms and poor window views of old apartments, then Novotel Century would not be a hotel that I would recommend to others.

<Content>Not Worth the Price My friend and I stayed at the Novotel for three nights. First off, the location of the hotel wasn't very conveinient, it was off the main street and was at least a good 10 minute walk from the MTR. Taxis were readily available and extremely cheap, but it was quite a challenge trying to explain where you want to go.  The outside of hotel and lobby area was very lavish, but plain. We stayed in a double room that was very small. The room was clean, the bathroom was large especially compared to the room, with a big tub and detachable/adjustable shower nozzle. the beds were stiff (which is supposedly typical for most Asian countries). The view from our room was depressing, overlooking dingy rundown apartments, so we kept the curtains closed most of the time. The air conditioning worked well. there was a mini bar, but like usual, the prices were rediculious so i wouldn't reccomend touching any of it. There was also a tv, but most everything was in Cantanese, except for the news. the pool looked clean, although i never took advantage of it, and the fitness center was very large.  Overall, i would say that our stay ranked pretty average, the place was overpriced for what it offered, and i would reccomend spending a few dollars more for a place with a view and more comfortable beds... the Renaissance was a lot nicer from what we heard.

<Content>Superb HK Value I just completed my latest weeklong stay at the Novotel Century, where I am consistently impressed with the value it offers.I received an executive rate that included breakfast and afternoon happy hour for about $270 USD, although taxes pushed the final figure up considerably. For this, I received a sizeable two-room suite, with a nice sitting room and a smallish but reasonable bedroom. Everything was spotless and clean. The sitting room was equipped with a quality Sony LCD TV and even a 5-speaker surround home theater setup. The bedroom had its own wall-mounted LCD TV as well. The layout of the room was a tad awkward, as the room had clearly once been two separate rooms - there were two doors to the hallway, still marked with consecutive room numbers. One of these doors led directly into the bathroom! Nonetheless, everything was comfortable.Furnishings were fine, but very European in their simple, function-oriented nature. The bed was very firm, the couches in the sitting room were minimalist and not at all plush, the coffee tables and desk were very plain. There was little in the way of luxury detailing, but everything was perfectly useful. The desk, in particular, was very nice in that it extended the full width of the bedroom, making plenty of space for work and storage. Bathroom water pressure and temperature were great and I experienced no problems. Ditto for the climate control, which was reliable and user-friendly. One minor bathroom complaint is the lack of a traditional shower curtain - a fixed glass shield only extends about half the length of the tub and shower. I consistently ended up with a soaked bathroom floor - annoying to later walk into with socks on.My executive room rate included a simple buffet breakfast in the executive lounge, as well as a complimentary afternoon happy hour with snacks. The smallish executive lounge is awkwardly furnished but I suppose it works. There is also a semi-public internet terminal in the lounge open to those who have paid for the executive rooms, and it is generally available. Breakfast was what I might term continental-plus, with a nice spread of fruits, yogurts, and breads, and a few small chafing dishes of scrambled eggs, bacon/sausage, and hash browns. Everything was self-service. The afternoon tea/happy hour featured a few bottles of liquor, several unremarkable wines, beer, sodas, tea, and coffee. There were usually several plates of finger sandwiches and two hot snacks, such as dumplings, croquettes, etc. It's not the best selection in an exec lounge I've ever seen in Asia, but it's a nice perk and I'm not one to turn up my nose at free liquor and nosh.I am pleased to report that what was once my biggest complaint about this hotel was amended on this trip - Internet access is now available via hardwired ethernet cable. The previous wireless-only connection was terrible - slow, intermittent, infuriating. The new wired option is fast and reliable. Even better, it was included in my room rate. The old wireless connection had been an added charge.I love the location of this hotel - it's about two blocks east on Lockhart Road from the bustling red lights and expat bars of Wanchai. It's a short 15-minute walk to Causeway Bay and Times Square. Access to public transit is superb - the Wanchai MTR station is two blocks away, and you can reach the Wanchai Star Ferry Pier via flyovers above street level in about 3 minutes. If you don't feel up to the MTR, regular buses into Central (and other destinations) are less than 2 blocks away. I can't imagine a better location on Hong Kong Island that puts you so close to so many things, with the real, bustling Hong Kong right at your doorstep.Service was fine at the hotel, although I had little interaction with anyone, as I don't typically avail myself of concierge, bellhop, or other services. The front desk does seem very crowded most of the time, but executive room priveleges include the ability to check in and out at the executive lounge on the top floor, so I didn't even have to deal with that.All in all, unless something at the Novotel changes dramatically for the worse, I won't ever consider another hotel in Hong Kong (except perhaps the Peninsula, for my honeymoon.). There is no better combination of location, comfort, and value in this expensive, exciting city. Extremely highly recommended.

<Content>improved with renovations I've stayed at this place a number of times since '02 and its recent renovation has definitely improved it, I had the misfortune to stay in the midst of its renovations last year but that's another story...The net result is smallish, but not that small by HK standards rooms, which have been very functionally designed to maximise use of the space. Even with two people, me and my wife its fine - and we do like our personal space. Location wise its in a slightly odd bit of Wan Chai, an area sort of full of shops that sell bathroom fittings, but an excellent choice if you want to be decently located on HK island itself.Plus point for me our office is now a 2mins walk away making it an obvious choice.We had a late lunch in the hotel when we arrived and were suitably impressed by the food, as were my colleagues.The hotel has a small but very decently equipped gym for those like me looking to do some weights, they charge HK$40 per use but I can live with that.Service was generally fine, although they obviously have a bit of an issue with a vast turnover of guests on a daily basis that most HK hotels have, but pleased to say didn't directly affect us.I'm almost certain to stay there again as by HK island standards this is pretty good for the dosh.

<Content>Ideal location We stayed here for a 2 night stopover in Hong Kong on our way to Australia for Christmas and New Year.On arrival, the check-in area was full of staff running around and it looked as though the majority of them did not know what they were doing. We booked our whole trip through Trailfinders and although we had booked 2 nights at this hotel, the hotel only had us down for one night. This error was amended, however, without issue.The whole hotel appears recently renovated and very modern. Our room was nicely decorated and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was served on a mezzanine level and was plentiful, varied and of a high quality.The location of this hotel was ideal for sightseeing, being within easy walking distance of the shopping areas and the Star Ferry terminals.We found some really good, local restaurants right next to the hotel, where we ate in amongst the locals. We couldn't understand each other, but the food was amazing and really cheap!Overall, this hotel suited our purposes perfectly and we would definitely recommend it to other travellers.

<Content>Clean but you can find better! We stayed at the Novotel Century for 7 nights in Jan 08. Being under the Novotel banner we expected a great place  excellent service but this was not the case.While the rooms were clean and modern the walls were paper thin. We could hear everything that went on in the other rooms which wasn't very nice. At 8am housemaids would start vacuuming the passages so no sleep-ins were allowed. The lobby had limited places to sit and where you could sit was a cafe. The waitresses would get annoyed if you sat there and didn't buy anything but this was all in the open of the reception area and you really wouldn't want to sit and eat a meal there with everyone walking through. As well the reception/lobby area was terribly noisy as well and it was just so LOUD.The reception staff were average and the housemaid's broke my personal shampoo bottle and left it sitting on the bench leaking everywhere. The all you can eat buffet breakfast was ok but the staff need lessons in friendliness and manners. As we didn鈥檛 have a laptop we needed a computer to access the internet  he business centre charged $30HK for 15minutes but found out that you could easily walk across the road to The Pacific Coffee Company  for the price of a coffee access their free internet.For the price there are so many more places in the area that you can stay so I would strongly recommend staying elsewhere.

<Content>Nice hotel Stayed at the Novotel at the beginning of September for 5 nights with my wife on business. The renovation is apparent in the reception area and the fact that the bar and restaurant is in a temporary location in the basement. We heard no noise from the work and while we were there all 6 lifts became operationalStaff were very helpful and friendly. The room was on the small side but was ok for the two of us.Hotel is located 5 mins from the Star Ferry to Kowloon and easy access to all public transport. The taxis that have got prime position outside the hotel don't want small fares, and are looking for runs to the airport, so don''t be surprised if they don't want to take you just a mile of so. They will even get you another passing taxi so they don't get a small fare.Overall nice central hotel that isn't expensive. Good for tourists and business. P.S. Air New Zealand crew stay there, so it must be ok.

<Content>Good hotel Stayed here 1st Aug 07 for 5 nights. The renovation work ongoing was no problem to me, it only goes on 9-6 and I was out during this time. There are only 2 lifts in operation so getting a lift could be tricky sometimes. The room was good, big enough for me and my wife and 2 young children, breakfast was great as was the pool. The pool however lacked a pool snack / drinks bar which was a pity. The hotel is in a good location, taxis plentiful and very cheap in HK. MTR (metro) about 10 minutes walk. Tram also about 2 minutes walk. This costs HK$2 which you pay on the way out no matter how far you go. This is about 15p. All in all I would stay here again. Great room rates, I got 拢47 (UK) a night.

<Content>Lovely Stay This is a very good deal. The location is prime...easily accessible to the ferry and the metro. The room was very clean and wasn't too small for a non-Western hotel. There was plenty of room for two people. The renovations were not a problem and the pool was delightful especially considering the heat and humidity in Hong Kong. The service at the desk was a bit slow as the hotel can be very crowded. However, I left quite a bit of money in my pants which had been sent to the laundry, and they immediately called me and brought it up to my room. There is an excellent breakfast in the hotel although the price can be a bit prohibitive.

<Content>Give the Novotel a Miss As in other reviews, they are doing reno's so and the noise is audible during the hours of 9am - 6pm. Its very loud in the make shift reception area. We stayed here for 3 nights. The bed was like sleeping on an ironing board. The rooms are tiny (we had adjoining rooms 1 king bed and 2 twin beds). The room with the twin beds was tiny you definately wouldn't have been able to put a rollaway bed in this room. The funny thing was that this was an upgraded room from the std room, so I would hate to think what the std rooms are like!!!! The location is great and there is a brilliant coffee shop/bakery straight across the road from the hotel which does a good breakfast but a fantasic coffee which is quite hard to find in HK. I have mastered it at Starbuck now make sure you ask for a double shot.

<Content>below average Spend five nights at the Novotel, 20 to 24 of June. The renovations are very noisy in the dayime. They start at 9 am  and finish around 6 pm, also on weekends. At this time there was only a makeshift restaurant everything is closed due to the renovations. You have to go outside or order room service. The room was not cleaned in a proper manner - the floor was  not vaccumed and the bedlinen was not changed in the 5 days  while I was there. The service in general was below average. I know its only a Novotel hotel, but when you pay good money  for a room there are some service expectations. May be they need to renovate the management as well. NB The location is good for the convention center, 10 min. walk. There are many good hotels in this price range, shop around or wait until after the renovatins are completed before you stay  here.

<Content>Great value hotel I have stayed at this hotel on a couple of occasions and would definitely stay there again. Its location is very convenient for the Star Ferry and it's only a short walk to the MTR via the many walkways. Trams and buses stop very near to the hotel and it's not too far to walk into Causeway Bayor Admiralty. If you're on holiday and aren't pushed for time then a good way to get into Central is to take the Star Ferry from the nearby Wanchai ferry terminal across to Tsimshatsui and then another ferry back into Central. For only a few pence for each crossing it's well worth it.There are many nice restaurants (western and oriental), cafes, internet cafes and bars near to the hotel, many of which are accessible via the numerous walkways. The Italian restaurant in the hotel is also very pleasant with good food, friendly staff and reasonable prices.The hotel rooms are quite compact but I wouldn't say they are excessively small. They are clean, comfortable and with all the facilities that you would expect. The reception area is quite large and the staff were efficient and friendly. The swimming pool is fairly average.Overall I think this hotel is very good value for money and a good base from which to explore Hong Kong.(One important point to make is not to confuse this hotel with the similarly named Novotel Century Harbourview which is situated much further out of town.)

<Content>Great Location We travelled with the excellent Oasis Hong Kong and stayed for 6 nights at the this hotel, to celebrate Chinese New Year. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a very friendly doorman, however the receptionist must of been having a bad day, hardly any smiles. We were on floor 13, but when we got into our room it was only made up for 2 adults, when in fact the booking was clearly made for 3. After a long night flight, this was the last thing that we needed. So we went back down to reception to be told that a fold away bed, plus additional towels etc would be with us shortly. Luckily it was and we were able to freshen up before starting the celebrations. With the 3rd bed, it did make the room quite cosy, but it was clean and quiet and you dont go to Hong Kong to sit in your room. The restaurant staff, food and service were excellent, lovely ample breakfast. A short walk to the star ferry, underground, buses, trains and the main road - highly recommended to all.

<Content>Very clean modern hotel We travelled to Hong Kong in early November 2006 and stayed here for 3 nights.The hotel was very busy and kept exceptionally clean.At check in we were given an upgrade to a superior room on an upper floor which was lovely and looked brand new.We would recommend the hotel to anyone staying in Hong Kong - the only minus would be that the staff were quite rude and surly on the desk. In fact, the customer service was not acceptable for this class of hotel.

<Content>Great Price, Location, Cleanliness, staff I got a great rate. I thought the staff was good. Great location. The rooms just big enough (who needs a LARGE room while traveling). Cleanliness was very good. The restaraunt downstairs was good if you are getting in late and tired. Just a couple of minutes walk away from Starferry terminal (one of them at least). Hong Kong park and Victoria Tram about 10-15 minute walk. Market and bars 5 minute walk. Would highly recommend if you can get in the 100 - 120 USD range.

<Content>Very disappointing This was my first trip to HK (early Dec 06). The overall experience was okay because of the sight seeing but I was not impressed by the hotel staff. Asian tourists asking questions of lobby staff definitely not liked. The rooms were standard. It says alot that the most friendliest and helpful staff were the housekeeping cleaning ladies! Stayed at hotel for 5 nights-and each morning the buffet breakfast was almost identical. Had heard so much about HK dim sum and even their 2 type-dim sum offering was not interchanged with other types. It does not take a lot to be creative to inject some variety into the buffet spread-after all a number of guests there including myself were there for conferences (extended stay). The waitresses there were often curt and distinctly less attentive to us Asians, clear discrimination in obvious better service to the westerners (becos they tipped well?? or they paid more for their rooms??). We were made to wait for coffee while a waitress went about filling up their cups (skirting around our table) even tho our request was made earlier. The dining experience was well below par than most 4-star hotels I have stayed. Very disappointing on that score. The hotel location is convenient- short walk to Wan Chai MTR, HKCEC and Star Ferry. If I were to visit HK again, I would stay elsewhere.

<Content>Get what you pay for We stayed at the Novotel for 4 nights, following our trip to Bali. We were put on the smoking floor, tho niether of us smoke. The room didn't smell smokey so I didn't ask to be moved. The rooms are small but clean. The bed was tiny and lumpy. Bathroom fine, shower really nice! The breakfast was dismal and definately not worth paying for - there are a few places nearby to grab something. Once you find you're way round you realise its a good location. The MRT is about a 10min walk and is clean, air conditioned and cheap (nothing like the London tube!!). The star ferry also has a landing dock at Wan Chai and is worth a trip over at night - around 15p a trip!! It can be a bit rough so beware! Times square is a good location for shopping. People raved about Nathan Road in Kowloon but we weren't impressed - I wouldn't advise people to buy electrical or camera equipment from the stores here, They seemed a bit dodgy. The are 2 floors in the Times Square mall devoted to electrical stuff. Be sure to open the boxes and try things before you buy. Nathan road does have a lovely Irish pub (about two thirds down on left hand side) which serves the most amazing burgers I've ever tasted!! We spent a day at Disney which was a really fun day out. 拢18 entrance. It is small compared to Eurodisney so must be tiny compared to the USA but great craic. Very few queues. Only 1 fast ride but after 3 goes on it we'd had enough! We also went on the cable car to see a giant Buddha. Bit of a tourist trap, cable car took 30mins each way but was not a scary ride compared to some I've been on. Listen out for the annoying song they play on a loop the entire trip! If the weather is good and you have the time it fills a morning but it was a bit dosappointing. Hong Kong is a vibrant, busy city which we will go back to but wouldn't choose the Novotel again.

<Content>Super hotel! We stayed here for 5 nights and we couldn't find any faults with the hotel at all. OK the room was a little small but it was lovely and bathroom was nice and clean. The location was excellent, no more than 5 mins walk from Hong Kong Convention Centre and the Star Ferry. We certainly would come back to this hotel again.

<Content>Good Service, Great Location This would be my second experience at this hotel - the first being way back in 1994, and I am quite happy with the service provided by the staff. I came with my family, and having my daughter aged 5+ with me, I didn't expect much for her since I've read reviews of the hotel being more suited to a business traveller. Things to be praised:-* Check in  Check out was fast (less than 3 mins) - so this is excellent service.* Welcome basket of fruits for the family* They even put in an extra bed for my girl (I did not put in a request) - and I was not charged for the bed. * Friendly staff (housekeeping); and the concierge was quite helpful when I seeked directions to an office around the area. On my return after the visit, the concierge staff even inquired if I found the venue (which was quite nice of him).* Sufficient amenities - since I had a family of 3 pax, they provide sufficient amenities including 3 x towels, 3 x toothbrushes, 3 paper sandals, 4 x pillows... etc.Things that can be improved:-* Bell boy -- how I wish there was a bell boy around to help me with my bags at the point of check in. This hotel caters to a lot of tourists, and there was a group of tourists checking in at the same. * The toilet flush was a little slow... individuals are recommended to check this out once you get the room.* I was checked in to the 6th floor, and these rooms are not refurbished... so don't take the pictures for granted. Things for note:-* Pay Per View channels cost HKD 90/movie -- but you can watch the repeats of the same show the entire day (they charge per movie per day basis) Note: Wan Chai is quite centrally located if you want a quiet area.... peaceful from the hustling and busy streets of Causeway Bay and Time Square. Excellent service is the main key to drive me back to the hotel.

<Content>Central location I was dreading our visit after reading other reviews but it is nowhere near as bad as some make out. The hotel itself is fine, very clean and smart and the staff were all polite and helpful. We were offered an upgrade when we arrived at no extra cost to us. It is obviously very popular as a business function location. it is conveniently situated and the red light area is far enough away not to be an issue and it is easy to walk anywhere - even at night by using the skywalks which cover a wide area including right down to the Star ferry which is only about 15 minutes away. The local MTR station is also only 5 minutes walk away. The only one thing I would suggest is that if you drink in the bar, stipulate the brand of drink you want from the menu they provide, as if you ask for example for just 2 whiskies they will give you the most expensive they have! Although the view from our room was not exactly picturesque I certainly wouldn't have any problem staying there again - after all I didn't go to Hong Kong to spend time inside a hotel room except to sleep!
