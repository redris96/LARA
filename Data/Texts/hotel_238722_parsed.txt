<Content>Will be back to this hotel!!! Just arrived back from Barceolona and the hotel Acacia. (Room 702). Basically, the hotel is very clean, exactly how it's described on the internet. The hotel reception staff were extremely helpful and always on hand to helpWe loved the location, in the nice Eixample area with nice bars and restaurants. We walked down to the heart of town every morning (Ramblas) and it took us around 15-20 minutes.Would I stay here again? Absolutely!!.

<Content>Bed Bugs!!!! I selected the Aparthotel Acacia based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. I needed a room for three persons and the Aparthotel Acacia was the highest rated hotel that slept three.The location was in a residential area not a tourist area. But with a metro stop located so nearby - access to Barcelona was easy. The rooms were large by European standards with a small refrigerator and kitchenette. Wi-fi was free.But my concern involves BED BUGS! The morning following our first night there - I noticed four bites on my stomach. But as I had never in my years of travelling experienced bed bugs, I thought nothing of the bites. We spent all day out seeing the sites and went to a late dinner. When we returned for the night, I wen to change into my bed clothes and realized that I was covered with bites on my torso - almost 90 of them!!We were tired and worn out from our first full day in Spain but there was NO WAY that I could sleep in that room (401) . I called to the front desk told them of the bed bug bites and they gave us another room. We packed up all of our belongings and moved to the 6th floor. Just as we were unpacking everything, we were called and told that we needed to move to another room. By the time that we got moved and settled and all keys down to the front desk - it was 1:30. My husband was tired and frustrated and talked to the front desk about compensation - he asked for one night on a five night stay and the front desk told him that he could not authorize it but he was sure that we could do something agreeable.I was freaked out, I spent time researching bed bugs on the internet. And the news is not pleasant. They are difficult to see and terrible to get rid of. They are not necessarily caused by a lack of cleanliness but actually travel with people on their luggage. They hide and come out an hour before dawn. They are very transient and move from room to room and can live for 18 months without feeding but typically feed every 4-5 nights. Needless to say I did not sleep well that night or during our stay there.In hindsight, we should have moved hotels but it was a busy Easter weekend and finding a room for three persons would be difficult.The next morning I went down to the front desk and spoke with the day manager. I even showed him a photo of my back with the bites to show that they did exist. I wanted to know that they took me seriously and treated room 401 extensively. When we returned from that day of touring, I was told that they did not have bugs. They did not allow animals in their hotels and that their hotel is very clean. They offered me a 5% discount or 35 euros not because they believed there to be bed bugs but because they had incovenienced us and had us move twice- ha! - what a joke.I tried to contact the hotel owner directly to ensure that he was aware of my concerns and to ask for further compensation. But I received no response.My bites did not multiply but did continue to get moe uncomfortable and affected my pleasure in the vacation. My husband and daughter also wound up with several bites on them. I continued to read about bed bugs and how to keep from taking them home with me. BED BUGS are nasty - people actually move from their homes because they cannot get rid of them.Upon our arrival home - we were forced to wash everything in the hottest possible water and dry for 20 minutes. Everything and I mean everything was sealed and sterilized or frozen, They even have been known to get into computers so nothing is safe from bed bugs. I have done everything possible to stop the contamination of my home.But I want to warn future travellers to beware of Aparthotel Acacia. Even the cleanest of hotels can suffer with bed bugs. And if the Aparthotel Acacia did not take my situation seriously and treat not only room 401 but the entire hotel as recommended by pest control specialists - the BED BUG infestation will only continue.

<Content>Lacks good customer service Requested room (non-smoking, back of hotel) was not ready when promised so we waited in the lobby for about one hour. When it was still not ready after an hour wait, we decided to go out to eat. When we came back to see our room, it was obviously a smoking room as the air reaked of cigarette smoke. By this time there were no other non-smoking rooms available on the back side of the hotel away from the street so we had to settle with a room facing the noisy street. The room was okay except for ambulance sirens all night long (hotel is near a hospital) and motorcycle noise (numerous in Barcelona). We arrived at the hotel after more than 10 hours of traveling, so we were anxious to get into our room to wash up and relax before we went out to eat. The ensuing problem with the hotel room not being ready, and then not getting the requested room was very disappointing. Also, it was impossible to prevent the shower water from splashing onto the bathroom floor because of the inadequate, dangerous shower door. The room's lights only work when you put the hotel's card key in a slot on the wall. Actually, you can use any hard card, like a credit card to keep the lights on when you go out while someone stays in the room. Avoid wasting your money on the coffee machine in the lobby as the coffee tasted somewhat like sewer water and hotel staff would not reimburse us. Parking (for a fee) under the hotel was very cramped and required numerous maneuvers in reverse to get around the turns. Forget about parking there if your car is larger than a compact car.

<Content>Don't arrive on a Sunday!! We had a short break at Aparthotel Acacia.Despite their insistence on knowing when we would arrive the rooms were not ready when we did arrive despite this being later than the check in time and later then we had estimated. One of our party had been taken ill hence our slightly later arrival and despite reception knowng about this distinct lack of interest in getting us our rooms.The light in the kitchenette area in one of the rooms didn't work in all the time we are there and on the last night they offered to change our rooms the next day - when we were due to check out!Shame as the rooms were spotless and well equipped.Arriving on a sunday means that the main supermarket and lots of bars and restuarants in the area were closed - better to get there one day earlier or later.Also in an area called Hospital Clinic gives you a clue - ambulances racing through the traffic sirens blaring! To get to the central tourist areas is a good 15 minutes walk and by metro involves a change.Nice hotel shame about the location and lack of customer focus.

<Content>Great Amenites, good metro location Pros:- Right next to the Hospital Clinic stop on the blue line metro- Good clean spacious suite rooms with kitchenette- Has a luggage hold room- Has hotel parking (if not full) for 10.70 Euros a day- All staff we met speaks English- Small supermarket right nearby- #3 NightBus also stops about 2 blocks away (since Metro stops at 12 am on weekdays/sun).Cons:- shower leaks (due to 1.5 foot length of glass that acts as a curtain)- hard beds- you give them your room key anytime you leave (as with all the hotels I stayed in while in Spain and Portugal) which is very insecure because anyone could go to reception and say room 210 or whatever, and they would just hand you the key._______I would recommend this place to anyone for it is a good deal. Everything was very nice and accessible. I would stay there again.

<Content>Clean, centrally located, friendly, helpful english speaking staff! A family of 3 staying for 3 nights. Metro underground stop (Hospital Clinic)is located practically outside door! Made it easy to get around. Taxis easily flagged in front of hotel. Restaurants on same block. Shopping (El Corte Ingles) is a 10 minute walk, food store next to metro stop. We had a room on streetside, but window glass was thick so very quiet besides sirens. Internal noise more bothersome - door buzzers, closing doors, voices, but for us tolerable. Kitchenette set up for 2 persons. Need to ask for more dishes if 3+. No microwave or toaster (for 3 nights ok). Staff excellent - answered all questions and provided things we asked for! Their English was excellent and they were polite at all times. Liked the fact there was 24hr reception. Would stay there again!

<Content>Highly Reccommended!! On a monthlong solo holiday to Europe, this was my favorite hotel. Friendly staff, spotless rooms and accessible location. My initial reservation was for three nights, but decided to extend two more because of the fantastic accommodations and wonderful city. The rooms were spotless and extremely comfortable, almost like a small apartment complete with sitting room, small kitchenette and plenty of storage room for luggage. All staff, front desk, room attendants, etc., were extremely friendly and helpful.Even upon check-out, the front desk attendant was very helpful in making sure I knew how/where to catch my next train.

<Content>A great spot! Stayed with my wife at the Acacia for two nights in June before moving to another Barcelona hotel to join friends. This is a great hotel--we had a large, quiet, one-bedroom unit with a large bathroom and small but convenient kitchen area. It was spotlessly clean and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. There are lots of shops and restuarants in the area---one of our best meals during our week in Barcelona was the lunch we had at the restuarant right next door to the hotel (to the right of the hotel when you are facing it ). And as an added bonus the nearest subway station is just 1/2 block away. The hotel is about 8 blocks from Rambla de Catalunya and about a 15-20 min. walk to Placa Catalunya/La Rambla. This would be my hotel pick whenever I next return to Barcelona.

<Content>Excellent family, friendly, clean centrally located Barcelona hotel This hotel is a well-located apartment hotel in L'Eixample area of Barcelona - that's the newer (as in 19th century) bit, based on a grid-layout. This means that it's about 4 blocks from the Passeig de Gracia - the upper level of the most famous Rambla - so about 10-15 minutes flat walk from the main Gaudi houses of La Pedrera and Casa Batillo. There's a metro stop - Hospital Clinic - 50m away. Having lived in Barcelona between 94 and 96, I wanted a hotel that would have on-street parking overnight, bigger rooms but not be too expensive for a family of 5 (although we needed 2 rooms). You don't get this in the Barri Gotic without paying lots of 5* money, and the rooms tend to be smaller.As other reviews remark, you get about 45m2 of space with a separate living area (which has a very comfortable fold-out double bed), smallkitchenette with fridge, hob, and basic pots, pans, glasses and cutlery, a good double bedroom and a comfortable spacious bathroom, with good water pressure. All spotlessly clean, with very comfortablebeds and (a real blessing) totally silent, yet very effective air-conditioning (and opening windows). Loads of really good restaurants nearby - both tapas style and plenty of pizza/pasta ones too. There's a very classy, consistently good one called Vinya-Roel, at c/Villaroel, 190-192 (tel 93-430 7279) that has been in the same hands for more than 13 years - and serves very high quality Spanish food (English, French, menus too) with really reasonably priced wine. About 2 blocks away.There are very fresh patisseries - including a really spendid, traditional one - just opposite - which serve great breakfast pastries and coffee; a Caprabo supermarket one block away (open 9am -9pm) and several late night small shops which will sell you beer, wine, milk and other late night essentials.Reception, chambermaids all very helpful - excellent English too. Can't stress enough that everything very clean, efficient and friendly. We slept really well - it's quiet there too - unlike the Barri Gotic where you get street noise at all hours. It's a few stopsaway on the metro to get to Plaza Catalu帽a - the main square at the top of the Ramblas - or you could walk it in about 20 brisk minutes.It made a great base for a 6 day family holiday. We'd certainly go back. Any quibbles - the car park under the hotel would only take very small cars - (but we fed the meter for 2 hours in the morning, and parking is free after 8pm at night, and generally easy to find);and you get bath gel rather than shampoo - so we bought our own for a couple of euros.I've stayed in a lot of Barcelona hotels on business - and I would rate this one highly for space, cleanliness, friendliness, and the things that matter like comfortable beds, efficient, quiet AC, a fridge to keep the milk (for cereal and coffee) and beer in. I'd certainly stay there again.

<Content>Excellent location, good stay. My mother-in-law, wife and myself spent a week at Aparthotel Acacia. Positives:The hotel is in an excellent location on a major street, 50 meters from a metro station for easy access to public transportation (and busses on D'Urgell and the next street can connect you to busses going to places like Parc Montjuic (sp?)), and numerous good restaurants and caf茅s within easy walking distance can take care of any breakfast/lunch/dinner needs. We never ate the breakfast the hotel offers so I cannot comment on it. The small kitchen and table for dining were perfect for our needs, and there are a couple of dishes and glasses in the kitchen. Don't plan on doing any serious cooking, but a bowl of cereal, heating a can of soup, etc. is no problem. The staff was, in general, polite and helpful.Nearby restaurants that we particulary enjoyed included Tapas Bar just next to the metro stop - for quick breakfast and good tapas at night. About 2-3 blocks north on the next street over we had an excellent meal at La Cratera.Negatives:We were a little disappointed with the arrangements for a family, like ourselves. The living area and the bedroom area were not sepearated by a true (floor to ceiling) wall, so there was not complete privacy between the two areas. Also, the bath/shower in the tub was worrisome in that it had a very high edge, with no grab bars, which was difficult to step into and out of for my mother-in-law who is 1) short 2) older. With a tile floor and smooth tub floor, this became very slippery when wet and my wife worried every time her mother showered. If you are interested in watching television while in the room, you may be a little disappointed with the small (13 inch?) television and the 3 button remote (on/off, channel up/down, volume up/down). We were not in the room much watching tv so it was not an issue.Also, the shampoo/conditioner they offered was a bath gel - more like a soap than anything. If you care about this, bring your own shampoo/conditioner or buy some in a farmacia. You won't find a 24-hour convenience store in the neighborhood, and the farmacies close about 9 PM I think.OVERALL, for the price this hotel has good amenities and an excellent location. For a couple who would like more space than you can get in a typical hotel (perhaps with children), some friends that don't require that much privacy, etc., I think this would be an excellent hotel. It's not in a typical tourist area, but you can get to them fairly easily if you don't have a problem with the metro or busses (of course, it helps if you can speak and read spanish well). I recommend booking directly on the hotel's website, which allows for on-line reservations.

<Content>Very friendly hotel My wife, 20 year-old son and I stayed here for three nights. It is an apartment style room with a small kitchenette, sitting area/bedroom and a separate bedroom. It was very comfortable. The bathroom was modern and clean. The staff was extremely helpful with recommendations and directions. The hotel is away from the old city, so the metro or a taxi is necessary. The metro stop is less than a block away. The location means it is much quieter in the evening than hotels in the center of the tourist area. A room service continental breakfast is available. There are a few bars and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Overall, it was a very good visit.

<Content>Excellent hotel, super friendly staff I stayed at Acacia for three nights, with my mother and sistor. The apartment is fair sized, it has a lovely large bathroom with a bath tub, and a small kitchen.The staff is very pleasant and friendly. On our arrival they immidiately offered to help us with anything we needed, and they were extremely helpful.The hotel is located about a mile from the centre of the city. However, it is only 50 metres from a metro-station, so it is very easy to get to the centre.The hotel can be easily accessed from the airport, just take the bus or the train to Estacio Sants, and take the metro from there to Hospital Clinic - only 50 metres from the hotel.Check out is at noon, and the staff stored our luggage for us, as we weren't leaving before 8 PM.
